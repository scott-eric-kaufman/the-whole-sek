Before you hoist pitchfork, carefully consider the following points:

1.  I'm teaching a composition course on rhetoric.  The point is not to have them read__literature, but understand rhetoric.  Given the dominance of visual rhetoric today, my emphasis on visual literacy should be understandable. 2.  This course is writing intensive.  Some teachers prefer to teach texts that model the sort of prose they want their students to produce.  But study after study has shown that having undergraduates read Emerson has no effect on the quality of their prose.  (Or the effect may be wholly deleterious, as when students who can't nest clauses come to believe their teachers expect them to write like Emerson.)  By shifting the time-intensiveness of the course from the consumption of rhetorically-loaded works to the production and refinement of rhetorical analyses, I think I'll have a better chance to improve the quality of their writing in the 10 weeks I have with them.
3.  Spandex.

Looks like an interesting course, and I'm in complete agreement with #2. I don't know if you're looking for suggestions, but Matt Madden's riff on Queneau's Exercises in Style, [99 Ways to Tell a Story](http://www.amazon.com/99-Ways-Tell-Story-Exercises/dp/1596090782/) might be a nice add, and in line with what you're doing...

Collin, your stamp of approval is worth its weight in gold to my conscience --- which had been, I must admit, a little put off by the "reading" I'd assigned.  I'm actually adding some of the Wolk, now that I've had time to read it (and _The Valve_'s event on it), but I'll take a look at the Madden tomorrow.

Based on some years of shuffling between classical music, jazz, and popular music, my feeling is that the intellectual quality of a class is not related in a straightforward way to the greatness or sophistication or canonicalness of the  material being studied. Comic books can kick Emerson's sorry butt if you find the right pedagogical angle.

Looks like fun, too. But is there still a danger that pitchforks will be hoisted because of this sort of "reading" list?

Well, OK, no pitchforks, as long as it's pitched as a **composition** class and not a [**literature**](http://english.dal.ca/Classes/2008%!-(MISSING)09%!U(MISSING)pper%!L(MISSING)evels/2080.03\_Cartoons\_and.php) class.... :-)

You should figure out some way to make comments auto-cross-post if you're going to slap everything on two or more blogs.

Given this particular visual-rhetoric focus, maybe some sequences from _Triumph of the Will_?  Superhero comics aren't fascist, but a lot of their visual rhetoric is.

Or at least have them listen to [Triumph of the Swill](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deadkennedys/triumphoftheswill.html), one of my favorite overdone rhetorical songs.

Not to be too much of a comics dork/Alan Moore homer - but I wonder whether you considered including [The Killing Joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:\_The\_Killing\_Joke)?  I know that Mr. Moore has expressed some dissatisfaction over the years with this particular work, but I think if you are teaching a class with a focus on visual rhetoric, this is an incredibly strong piece on that front.

There was also a short piece written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by Dave McKean called "A Glass of Water" that I always loved.  It was published by the short lived imprint Piranha Press, which was Vertigo before Vertigo.

At any rate, sorry to jump in with unsolicited suggestions - I only did it because I was intrigued, I swear.
