## On Scholarship Old & New; or, Tedious Exercises in Rote Aggression, Part MMDCCLIX

Many scholars today like to imagine a golden age of scholarship once existed.   A time when no quoted Derrida . . . when no one had heard of Foucault . . . before structuralism presented itself to be posted.  I refuse to buy into the myth.  Nor do I think that post '66 criticism represents the nadir of human intellectual achievement.  But then again I don't feel very old.  Like [others](http://unknownstrains.blogspot.com/2006/01/on-moretti-drout-and-being-young-in.html) who haven't been tethered to this maypole long enough to become vomitously embittered, I see these compulsive acts of demarcation as tedious exercises in rote aggression.  When I get in conversations of this sort, I imagine respondants moving as if through Jello . . .  grasping at tufts of carpet as they make their way to their computers to confront some stranger whose point irked them from their beds.  They type like drones.  As their words drawl across the page they imagine revolutions in their head only to have them sag like the jeans they've worn two weeks straight: in all the wrong places but without that low-class look all the ladies seem to dig.  (No one digs such slobs as these.)   

Or maybe I'm projecting.  Needless to say I don't think there's been a golden age of criticism.  Since learning that I'd be hitting the market as a Nineteenth Century Americanist I've started reading nineteenth century literature as I fall asleep.  (When I'm not too busy indulging in [adolescent fantasies](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/acephalouss\_ind.html).)  That may sound like a slap across the face of nineteenth century American literature.  It isn't.  More often than not it keeps me up at night.  (Especially Hawthorne . . . _especially_ his short fiction.)  But because the majority of my complete collection of nineteenth century American literature comes from the estate of [an emeritus Americanist](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/the\_pickle\_meme.html) who passed away some time ago, all of my books are hopelessly outdated.  As I read Milton R. Stern's edition of [_Billy Budd_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0672514664)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) (1974) I'm as struck by the confidence beaming through its footnotes as I am by its disturbingly burnt orange cover.   

Because Melville died before completing _Billy Budd_,__sussing out his final editorial decisions should be a difficult task . . . unless you are a sure-handed critic writing at the height of your belief in your own informed infallibility.  In which case you would declare with absolute certainly that although
it is difficult to know whether Melville abandoned the idea but left the notation on the page, or whether he planned an addition on this subject.  _Presumably he would have included it had he lived to complete a final copy_.  (Emphasis _totally_ in the original.)

That "presumably" works its way under my skin because I simply cannot imagine a comfortable familiarity secure enough to allow myself to presume how an author of Melville's stature would line edit his novel.  I simply can't.  I don't think less of Stern for trying but I do think that the sort of supposition lands well beyond the pale of contemporary scholarship.  

Or maybe I only say that because I feel I could forecast the opinions of a number of authors (some living, some dead) on a number of issues.  For example, I've already composed Pynchon's rebuttal to last night's State of the Union speech.  As soon as I hear back from his lawyers it'll hit the web guns ablazin' . . .

Wait- are you saying I shouldn't wear my jeans two weeks in a row?

(Say, I've never posted here, and I don't think I know you, but I hope you won't mind a comment on your blog from a hopelessly obtuse student with poor editing skills)

As we all know from experiences with Goethe, the only serious way to decide what an author might say now is to make a latex model of the authors head and speaking organs, complete with bellows, and let the author speak for herself.  It works far better if you have access to the room where they were working, but I believe that this process can be fruitfully completed even outside of those kinds of locations.

Barring this kind of intervention, I am always fascinated when people make those kinds of presumptions; I like them because they add a second voice to the author's corpus.  Since these kinds of presumptions are usually premised on the idea that there is a coherent author who would have intentionally made a particular choice, I read these presumptions with glee: in supplementing the text of the author, they relate one more way in which the voice of the author is split.

Of course you should, Jon.  You just shouldn't be _proud_ of the fact that you do.

John, welcome to Acephalous!  We're open late _every_ night for _your_ convenience.  I'm a fairweather fan of such glosses, however, since they're often terrible.  Melville shouldn't be second-guessed by a third-rate critic (or parodied, as above, by a fourth rate one); that said, there's something to the notion that critics of the older, single-author-study model would be better equipped to make those kinds of judgments than their contemporary equivalents.  Reading Delbanco's recent biography of Melville, I realized how much research and, to put it lightly, obsessiveness it takes to be able to ventriloquize an author.  (I feel like I'm almost able to speak for Jack London now, only I can't because the investment of time and energy I've put into acquiring that ability has made me loathe thinking about the man.  There must be something to the "Great Man" theory of literary studies, if only because the habitation of lesser minds makes one want to lose one's own.)

"...there's something to the notion that critics of the older, single-author-study model would be better equipped to make those kinds of judgments than their contemporary equivalents. Reading Delbanco's recent biography of Melville, I realized how much research and, to put it lightly, obsessiveness it takes to be able to ventriloquize an author."

I agree that those critics would be in a better position to make those claims meaningful, but I wonder if the stakes of such claims have changed.  I am not sure that even an author's accounts of her own choices are very meaningful to me except insofar as (and this is why intentionalist efforts remain interesting to me) they indicate the desires of the reader which underwrite the "obsessiveness" of reading a text in that mode.

The better equipment of the single-author study is not a more objective view of the author, but rather the willingness to believe that there -is- a unified and coherent author which could be studied.  This belief is something that seems to me (and I have to say that although I am done with my coursework, I feel woefully inadequate in making claims about contemporary academic practice) worn out in the last fifth of the XXth century and only now something which people are starting to fully operate within.

But my belief is probably more representative of what and who I read rather than the actual fact of academic praxis.  But it is fun to have this kind of gap between myself and the text, in which I cannot fully obsess about the text: a gap illustrated by author-oriented critiques which sublimate the gap, a space for the people who really, really believe in the author.

Maybe I'm off, but I think that what "it takes to be able to ventriloquize an author" is not research but quasi-pathological obsession.
