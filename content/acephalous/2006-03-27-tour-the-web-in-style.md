The conversation about "Spate Heech" continues at [Rodney](http://locus.cwrl.utexas.edu/herring/blog/2)'s, [Pepperell](http://www.roughtheory.org/content/did-i-do-that#more-39)'s, [Jodi](http://jdeanicite.typepad.com/i\_cite/2006/03/profanity\_and\_p.html)'s and [Hysterical Blackness](http://hystericalblackness.blogspot.com/2006/03/spate-speech-or-honest-mistake.html)' respectives places.  Proof positive that _the Internet works_.  That should silence all you doubters.

This [snark](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2006/03/theses-on-higher-eclecticism.html)-inspired [conversation](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/adamkotsko/114330898285047649/) only improves with age . . . even if it is the source of the "[Scott](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/adamkotsko/114330898285047649/#391980)'s [not funny](http://www.long-sunday.net/long\_sunday/2006/03/the\_beginnings\_.html#c15412243)" meme responsible for torpedoing [my Koufax campaign](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002518.html).  

Ken's [post](http://ghostinthewire.org/archives/2006/03/the\_temporality.php) deserves 1) more attention and 2) a response.  Now that I'm finished with this quarter and have a whopping _four days off_ I intend on writing one.

It's not like I didn't already like [Michael](http://www.michaelberube.com/).  Only now I like him _[that much more](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/die\_even\_harder\_with\_a\_vengeance\_iv/)_.  If only there were some way I could take advantage of his celebrity . . .
