## Lindon Barrett, RIP

Earlier today, I learned a man I rarely agreed with [had been murdered](http://collegelife.freedomblogging.com/2008/07/15/breaking-news-former-uci-professor-found-murdered/).  Seven years ago, Lindon Barrett had the gall to inform me—a grad student at the institution in which he held tenure—that I was full of shit.  I dealt in "useless abstraction," to quote from his comments on my seminar paper, and I hated him for writing that.  

He was, of course, absolutely correct.  

The man loved to argue, but he gave you room and time enough to state your case.  But the combativeness of the seminar room relented in office hours, as when I went to speak to him about my paper on "Rip Van Winkle" and the legacy of American slavery.  (To reiterate: I was _full of shit_.)  His voice barely above a whisper—he had lectured earlier, he said, and lost it reading Frederick Douglas too enthusiastically—he helped bring order to my swirling mess of thought.

I've been reading the comments [posted](http://www.ohindustry.com/2008/07/in-memoriam-lindon-barrett.html) [elsewhere](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/7/15/164643/917/104/552137) [tonight](http://collegelife.freedomblogging.com/2008/07/15/breaking-news-former-uci-professor-found-murdered/), so I don't want this to sound like a criticism, but I can't help but remember how Barrett responded to a short paper I turned in on [_Clotel; or, The President's Daughter: A Narrative of Slave Life in the United States_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312152655/diesekoschmar-20): "Sentiment is a ruse."  

And I'd fallen for it.  

I was the white guy who read anti-slavery tracts and felt damn fine about himself for bravely opposing slavery a hundred years after the fact.  Barrett told me I should've turned my attention to the racist logic underlying the self-congratulatory victory laps I was running, but I was young and possessed an abiding faith in the epicness of my egalitarianism.  

He was, of course, absolutely correct.

I still think he was wrong about a host of other things, but tonight I dispose any particular disagreements we may have had, to say plainly, with thunder, I wish we'd had the opportunity to have them.

Whoa.  I only ran into him a couple of times while at UCI, but still...damn.  That's just awful.

What you share here explains much--in a very good way--that I admire about your readings of texts that you've posted here.

Sometimes, we learn more from our presumed adversaries than we are at first willing to admit.

RIP, indeed.  And thanks for this.  He sounds like he was a hell of a teacher.

I never had a class with him, but in my brief interactions he seemed like a really sharp and bright person. On the one hand, this remembrance has an edge to it, but I think you illustrate your overall point very well that sometimes dialectical arguments or personal dislikes can lead us to really surprising realizations. And in your highlighting his harshness, you highlight what was also most poignant about him: thoughtful provocation. I get it. Rest in peace Professor Barrett.

I understand how you feel. His lectures were kind of imposed to make one believe everything he knows... but that was the goal. Regardless of how strict or how off he might have seemed he was a person who was for change. He indeed was a stupendous arguer and would allow the arguments of others only to shoot down their argument with his. He shall forever be missed.
