_Sing sweetly, my Muse, of the glorious lull between final drafts and
final papers!  Aid me in the completion of posts half-written for
months!_

After reading [the Synecdochic Prof](http://profsynecdoche.blogspot.com/)'s recent paean to [alternate histories](http://profsynecdoche.blogspot.com/2005/06/pleasure-and-alternate-history.html)--which included a link to the second most valuable and strange compendium of genre fiction I've found online, [Uchronia](http://www.uchronia.net/)\*--I couldn't help but be reminded of the essay I once intended to write about Kim Stanley Robinson's _[The Years of Rice and Salt](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553580078/qid=1118623083/sr=8-1/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i1\_xgl14/103-0718353-4437452?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)_, but then I remembered why I hadn't written it: I had nothing intelligent to say about alternate histories.  I couldn't really speak to what Neil Gaiman had done in _[Marvel 1602](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785110704/ref=pd\_pym\_fi/103-0718353-4437452)_ or to Byrne and Newman's far more modest accomplishments in _[Back in the USSA](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0929480848/qid=1118623374/sr=2-2/ref=pd\_bbs\_b\_2\_2/103-0718353-4437452)_  (despite its flaccid portrayal of Soviet-controlled America's version of Hunter S. Thompson).  What most of these novels--not counting Gaiman's, which is really an extended version of the Marvel's spandex-centric _What If...?_ series--have in common is a fundamental misunderstanding of fundamental (and typically material) historical processes.  In the years since the James Gleick's _[Chaos](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140092501/qid=1118623932/sr=8-1/ref=pd\_csp\_1/103-0718353-4437452?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)_, this genre's taken the butterfly-flapping-its-wings-Hurricane-Andrew-hits-Gulf-Coast premise to increasing absurd heights: 
Hitler decides to wax his mustache one morning, his barber tells him a story about a man named Harry whose two mistresses sought each other out and decided to make Harry pay and **_BAM!_** Hitler decides he'd rather not fight a war on two fronts and the Nazis rule the world until a series of improbable love affairs between Jews and Gentiles brings the whole Thousand Year Empire crashing to its knees. 

Small political or material changes during unstable times can alter world history.  I understand that.  But I believe there's a problem with the direct causality so many of these alternate histories imagine.  One of the lessons I've taken from Jared Diamond's _Collapse_ is that there's never a single isolated factor, easily narrativized, that murders empires.  (And  I didn't necessarily have to learn that from _Collapse_, but it's ready to mind so it gets the privilege of place.)  Empires collapse under the weight of immense bureaucratic ineptitude, not a single mistake by a singularly inept bureaucrat.

What I'm saying--barely more intelligently than I thought I would--is that the attraction of butterfly/hurricane model to alternate historians is the old liberal bugaboo, romantic individualism, which likes to imagine that Great Men still Change the World.  The vehement (but by no means total or consistent) rejection of romantic individualism by literary scholars and the concomitant appeal of tired, unproven (and often unprovable) Marxist critiques of capitalism have a similar effect: namely, the desire to create a model of human society built not upon concerted action but on the unpredictable results of highly contingent processes.  Marxist faculty members--few and far between these days, I grant you, but a hornet's nest is stirred up by a vigorous thwack with a big stick, not a judicious estimate based on an accurate accounting--assuage their oppositional souls with the assurance that teaching generations of students about symbolic oppression will whip some social butterfly in Boston around with such force the flames under the proletarian ass of some impresario on the Indian subcontinent will be sufficiently well-fanned...

_Harken, all Muses, to the many offenses I commit!  Make certain
my stupidities reach fair Clio’s ears, and maybe even
Urania’s, as she owes me $8.29 or a milkshake of equivalent
extravagance!_
