"How much longer should I leave this in the broiler?"

"At least another 10 minutes."

Sometimes the best a blog can muster ain't all that much.  The day after being called [one of the better academic bloggers](http://www.slanttruth.com/2006/05/22/busy-busy-busy/)
around I completely punt a post about academia.  I either overthought
what should've been a breezy blog or underthought what should've been a
substantial article.  Or both.  So here are the contradictory points I
wanted but failed to address yesterday:

1.  Some people (Greenblatt) teach the works they love
(Shakespeare) better than those they don't.  Other people (me) teach
the works they love (Didion) worse than those they don't.  (Critical
eyes being more easily turned toward works we don't altogether like.)
2.  Some people (CR) have a love which drives their intellectual
production.  Other people (me) have an interest which drives their
intellectual production.  Thus:
3.  Some people (me) should be more drawn to Theory than other people
(CR).   Other people (CR, Laura, Marco) should be more drawn to the
"amorous historicism" Caleb Crain discussed in his _n+1_ essay.  (Yet the opposite seems true.)
4.  Adam is a Grammar Nazi.

The problem?  All of these statements (sans #4) are
oversimplifications.  The other problem?  All of these issues (sans #4)
are related in some fundamental fashion.  The _other_ other
problem?  I'm tackling these issues (sans #4) as "successfully" as I do
an argument with eighteen planks and countless unstated premises.  That
is:

Poorly.  

Yet the desire to encompass it all immediately overwhelms.  I don't
know where to start but I desperately want to finish.  Not at all
unlike writing a dissertation chapter.  (Note to all paying attention:
still not finished.)  This all ties into the [thread without end](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2006/05/the\_parallax\_vi.html#comment)
John's hosting.  Were I not oddly reluctant to tackle any of these
issues individually I could probably sort through it in a way that
would make them meaningful to others.  (Is this the sort of blog
noodling people are always complaining about?)
