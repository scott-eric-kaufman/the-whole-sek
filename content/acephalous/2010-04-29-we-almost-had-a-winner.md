So what, in the end, nearly [killed me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/04/the-first-and-last-what-concatenation-of-improbable-events-will-kill-sek-tomorrow-contest.html)?  The [dirty feminist](http://www.pandagon.net/) who thought it prudent to post the following image on her Facebook wall this morning:

[![Fuck you flowers](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133ed11b43d970b-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133ed11b43d970b-popup)

Not cool, Marcotte.  Not cool.  Some of us can't afford to gasp between guffaws for five minutes.

I have sent this to four coworkers today. Not because it is so funny (it is) but because that is what kind of Friday today has been. I want to kick flowers in the fucking face.

Glad to have you back where you belong!  So, you now can't breathe and you can't hear.  Do you have a cat trained to come to your aid??  Hope you are getting TLC from the wife and not infecting her.  Just make some chicken soup and get some rest or ask your students to come to your place and hold class on the tennis court.
