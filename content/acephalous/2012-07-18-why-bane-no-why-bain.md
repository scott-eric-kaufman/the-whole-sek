## Why Bane? No, why <em>Bain</em>?

By now, you’ve already heard too much about [this ridiculous story](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/the-paranoid-style-of-comic-book-villainy/259998/):

Have you heard this new movie, the Batman movie, what is it, _The Dark Knight Lights Up_ or whatever the name is. That’s right, _Dark Knight Rises_. Lights Up, same thing. Do you know the name of the villain in this movie? Bane. The villain in _The Dark Knight Rises_ is named Bane, B-a-n-e. What is the name of the venture capital firm   that Romney ran and around which there’s now this make-believe   controversy? Bain. The movie has been in the works for a long time. The   release date’s been known, summer 2012 for a long time. Do you think   that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire breathing   four eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane?

To answer the question that’s asked, it’s no coincidence at all, because of [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:\_Knightfall):

[![Bane](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01676898cb7a970b-500wi "Bane")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01676898cb7a970b-popup)  
But that’s beside the point. The real  question—the one that no one seems to be asking—is why _Bain_? I know the real reason is [ego cheap and clean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain\_Capital#1984\_founding\_and\_early\_history),  but it boggles the mind that these titans of industry decided that  their public face should be the homonym of a word which means, according  to my _Oxford English Dictionary_,

1. A slayer or murderer; one who causes the death or destruction of another.

2. a. That which causes death, or destroys life. b. Poison. Also in _comb._ in names of of poisonous plants or substances, as in Dogbane, Henbame, Leopard’s Bane, Rat’s Bane, Wolf’s Bane, etc.

3. Murder, death, destruction.

4. That which causes ruin, or is pernicious to well-being: the agent or instrument of ruin or woe, the ‘curse.’

5. Fatal mischief: woeful or hapless fate.

6. A disease in sheep, the ‘rot.’

Which means that a group of seemingly  intelligent people—at least as judged by their inherited wealth—sat around  in a board room one day and decided to christen their corporation with a  name whose _most positive association_ is “[a] disease in sheep, the ‘rot.’” The fact that any of their failures could be _accurately described_ as having been “the agent or instrument of ruin or woe, the ‘curse’”  never seems to have passed their respective minds. It’s the equivalent  of opening a company called We Exploit Child Labor for Great Profit,  then wondering why no one seems to want to buy your jeans. And yet one  of the minds responsible for this feels himself qualified to serve as  the Executive Brand of the United States of America?

He’ll homonously be the bane of America as much as he and his party literally are.

There is one, more positive, association: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad\_Bain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad\_Bain)

The short answer, according to the lowest common aggregator of information, is that it was named after its founder, [Bill Bain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain\_Capital), who's got a reasonably good reputation  in financial circles.

The homonym issue doesn't seem to have bothered Baen books. As Spider Robinson wrote, "I know a simple, four-letter word whose meaning can, by the transposition of the last two letters, be precisely reversed-without altering its pronunciation."
