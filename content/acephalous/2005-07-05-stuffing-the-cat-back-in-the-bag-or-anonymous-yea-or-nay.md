## Stuffing the Cat Back in the Bag, or Anonymous: Yea or Nay?

After reading Atrios' [post](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005\_07\_03\_atrios\_archive.html#112052504618672753) yesterday on the value of blogging anonymously, I've decided to stuff the cat back into the bag.  That's right: I'm going back to being anonymous.\*  I mean, imagine if this had happened to me:
If you write something on the internet, it's public. A big blog links
to it, suddenly you go from 50 hits per day to 5000 in one day. 5 hours
later, CNN puts it on their "inside the blogs" segment, and suddenly
you've gone national to a non-blog reading audience who are perhaps
unaware of conventions of blogging.

From 50 to 5000 hits in a single day?  On CNN?  Why would Lou Dobbs be interested in reading the insightful political analysis I never write?  Why would Larry King want to the know the conventions of academic essay-writing?  Why would that frightening woman--the one with the platinum hair and ridiculous blazers--why would she report on my penchant for rare and unusual words (and penning highly personal faux citational histories)?  Why?

Or maybe Atrios isn't talking about academic bloggers.

Maybe the CNN will never love the A. Cephalous the way the A. Cephalous loves the CNN.  

Wait wait wait, the A. Cephalous doesn't love CNN.  The A. Cephalous and his wife were discussing this very morning how little love the A. Cephalous household has for the CNN, what with its inspiring stories about [giving underprivileged children pajamas](http://www.pajamaprogram.org/) and [relentless attention to the weather](http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/).\*\*  Maybe that's why the CNN will feature the A. Cephalous, out of spite, out of hatred for the A. Cephalous' hatred.  Then maybe the A. Cephalous will have to strike back.  That's right, the A. Cephalous will strike back.  

_Preemptively_.

From this day forward, the A. Cephalous will devote all his anonymous resources to destroying the CNN.\*\*\*  Beware, Lou Dobbs!  Beware, Larry King!  Beware, disturbing-woman-with-hair-and-blazers!  Your time has come!

\*Not really.  

\*\*Not that we shouldn't provide underprivileged children with pajamas, mind you, but maybe it shouldn't be in the regular news cycle?  Why not devote an entire hour to vigorously yanking of our collective (collected?) heartstrings?  Call it, um, call it [Dateline](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3032600/) or something.

\*\*\*Not really.

Anonymity is the way to goy, er, go. Stealthily the netizen askd the real questions and exposes the hypocrisies and frauds of cyber-consumerism.  Only while proxied would some creepo have the nerve to say that ones schwanz starts to quiver and enlarge when that CNN newshrew's botoxed labia begin to voice bogus concerns and sound bites of Walmartia (of course the sound is off), until she is cathode-smeared with a quick dollop of middle-class angst-juice
