## Airplane Reading Redux; or, Maximal Manipulation and Red Propaganda

A followup to yesterday's [mildy cryptic post about airplane reading](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/some\_serious\_ai.html):  

The buried premise concerned the panel on "English Studies and Political Literarcy."  One of panelists seemed to argue that the number of hours spent complexifying one's brain by reading anything other than text-messages had a direct correlation to one's desire to engage in practical politics.  I don't consider that correlation direct nor even extant because [I have seen the right-wing blogosphere](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/so\_now\_you\_care.html) and it frightens me.

A few people emailed me with sarcastic remarks about [what I](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0679722769)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) [must read](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0801858305)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) [at 30,000 feet](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0060638508).  Not.  Even.  Close.  On the trip from George Bush to John Wayne (When would _you_ stop finding it amusing?) I read the first 200 hundred pages of the latest John Le Carré, [_Absolute Friends_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0316159395)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).   It is not "a blazingly good novel" or "a triumph" or "a searing, startling novel."  Nor is it "his best novel in years."  What can I say?  

Blurbs lie.

It _is_ the second best novel about someone born on 15 August 1947.   ([The competition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0140132708)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) is stiffer than you think.)   And it does contain many of the well-turned sentences I have come to expect from a John Le Carré novel.  The official report on a brawl reads:
_Seizing said respected captain by the collars of his uniform in a manner totally contrary to good order and military discipline,_ [Major Mundy] _three times head-butted him with great accuracy causing extensive facial bleeding, kneed him purposefully in the groin and, resisting the efforts of his perturbed comrades to restrain him, dragged the captain onto the veranda and administered such a horrendous rain of blows wtih his fist and feet as might have gravely endangered the captain's very life and being, let alone jeopardized his marital prospects and distinguished military career._

Say what you will about easy targets.  Le Carré consistently hits them.  That's more than you can say about most "merely adequate" novelists.  That said, this novel contains one feature of unselfconscious work which bothers me: the appeal to nonfictional perfection in a fictional narrative.  When "a parsonical man in a Bible-black hat" questions Mundy about his past and finds it perfect double-agent material: 
Your tutor was a Red, your first girlfriend _is_ a Red, you're a member of the St. Pancras Labor Party, which is good and left, you're married to a woman of left-wing lineage whose father was a full-blown comrade till he lapsed in 'fifty-six.  You're a miracle, dear boy!  If we'd had to invent you, you wouldn't be _half_ as convincing.

When I read this confirmation of the perfection of a fictional character for a fictional function I cannot help but think the author has rendered an unlikely situation doubly so.  It is no more difficult, after all, to write into existence a flawed than a perfect double-agent.  The pay-off for the reader at this particular narrative moment is the product of pure authorial manipulation.  The problem isn't the manipulation so much as how manipulated the reader feels.  In this case, this reader feels maximally manipulated for minimal narrative gain.  But what do I know? I was reading this on an airplane.

What I found to be strikingly odd about Le Carré's writing, at least in his early books, was his weird philosemitism.  I mean, it's better than anti-semitism, don't get me wrong, but Jews occupy a strange space in his books: they're all such perfect Others, functioning as representative of the intellectual life that the narrator wishes he had, sacrificial victims to prejudice, or other time-tested roles.  Don't even start on "The Little Drummer Girl" if this kind of thing bothers you; that one has (as far as my vague memory goes) a Christian woman Giving Her All up as a spy for the Israeli secret service in a sort of compensatory sacrifice motif.

The 'appeal to nonfictional perfection in a fictional narrative' is a very interesting tic, and one I feel to be unworthy of a novelist as generally accomplished as Le Carr-e-acute-can't-remember-the-html-keypadcode-for-the-letter.  I teach Creative Writing, and it's one way of separating the most naive from the slightly less naive in the first year seminars:  the former use cliche (clich-seeabove) in an ingenuous way.  The latter recognise the cliche, but instead of thinking of a non-cliched way of putting it they try and defuse their usage with a 'if I read this in a novel I wouldn't believe it!' strategy of sort or another.  It's a pretty feeble trick, I agree: but then I also think that, actually, it's the whole cultural logic of Postmodernism 'in a nutshell', as the cliche would put it.  It's Umberto Eco's observation that under the logic of postmodernity we can no longer say 'I love you'; we have to say 'as Barbara Cartland would say, I love you'.

I say this not to knock Pomo, which rules.  Rocks.  Is Cool.  Etc.  It's more a statement about cultural prior saturation and the inevitable belatedness of 'new' cultural production.

Isn't this better explained by characters lying to each other?
