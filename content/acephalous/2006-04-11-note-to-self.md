**YOUR CLASS BEGINS AT 9:30 NOT 9:00!Â  DO NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE UNTIL 9:00 UNLESS YOU _WANT_ TO SIT IN YOUR EMPTY CLASSROOM FOR 45 MINUTES!**

Is it really perverse for me to admit that I like sitting in my empty classroom for a bit before students turn up?  I feel less flustered if I can unpack and settle without anyone looking on...

Not perverse at all; in fact, it's the way I like to work too (esp. in the years I've had the laptop).  But leaving the house an hour early (for a ten minute walk to campus) and sitting there in my classroom knowing that I could've spent that time, I don't know, with my wife, or asleep, or playing with the cats or, god forbid, working on my dissertation--needless to say, I feel silly.  (Plus this is the third time in the three days of class we've had so far that I've done this.)
