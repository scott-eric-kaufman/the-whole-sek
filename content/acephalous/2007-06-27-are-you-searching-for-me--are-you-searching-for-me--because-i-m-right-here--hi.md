Since Luther [sounded the alarm](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/last\_month\_i\_ch.html#comment-73374738) last week, I've been reluctant to even check my site stats for fear of seeming unseemingly solipsistic.  However, since I let down my shields on Sunday so that others [might have much fun more freely](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/blogwar-an-inte.html), I've had occasion to ban numerous spam-bots ... which means I've been trawling my site stats for spammers' IP addresses.  I wouldn't normally share, but one search worries me.  It's not that it's performed hourly—even though it is—so much as its specificity that concerns me.  

See, someone desperately wants to know the results of [this search](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!s(MISSING)cott+eric+kaufman%!)(MISSING), and keeps coming to _[Acephalous](http://acephalous.typepad.com)_ from [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/archive\_author/sekaufman/Scott%!E(MISSING)ric%!K(MISSING)aufman).  What with all the talk of "[Family Jewels](http://news.google.com/news?q=%!f(MISSING)amily+jewels%!)(MISSING)," I can't help but be suspicious.  Because I _am_ suspicious, for reasons recent and otherwise, and would appreciate if the person who wants tabs on me drops me a line directly.  I'm utterly approachable.  Point of fact, I'm "[the nicest fucking person on the internets](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_6016.html#466303)."  A quick email will sooth my soul, which roils with alarming alacrity in light of recent (and otherwise) events.

(Also, I must still respond to Miriam's [tag](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2007/06/eight-meme.html), lest I feel like some endangered bear on a romp for food too far from home: thought for dead, cubs stolen, pining alone in my den of snow.)
