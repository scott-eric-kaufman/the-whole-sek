## MLA for Thee but not for Me

My decision not to attend the MLA was a wise one.  I'll miss the talks, the panels, the blogger meet-up, the _other_ blogger meet-up—but if I'd flown to Chicago I would've spent every talk, panel and meet-up with my head in Irvine, and I would've missed something even more important than my career.  I won't bore you with the details—not that I think you lack sympathy, I'm just not much in the mood to re-live the last three days.

Needless to say, blogging will be light for the foreseeable future.

I'm so sorry, Scott--both selfishly sorry, not to have the chance to see/meet you again, and more genuinely sorry for you and Rachel. I hope the new year brings better things.

I'm very sorry, Scott.  They fit so perfectly and then they leave such a hole.  I miss mine still.

Oh man!  We're sending you and Rachel our best beat-the-cancer vibes ... and our congrats that, in contrast to some other folks in the trade, you've got your work-life-balance dial screwed the right way.

Hang in there, bro. It's all about the war, not the battle.

There are some moments that define what type of person you are - this has been it for you.  You are a kind and loving person who feels not just for humans, but to animals who enter our lives and who give love freely.  Rachel is that for you and I am happy you will have more time with her.  Just don't keep her for you and not for herself.  You are her mother and the love you give her is as strong as a mother's love.  Enjoy the time you have with her for now. For one who was alone this Christmas to another who was alone it is hard and makes you realize the balance between work and home sometimes makes you realize just what is important.
