Texas 
advertises itself as a "Whole 'Nother Country," but that's only true if you live 
off a farm-to-market road.  Houston's sprawl is as uniformly bland as the city 
that extends from Los Angeles to San Diego; but in the actual South, even the 
metropolitan areas surprise you.  

This is my way of saying: as I'm writing from a location where the power—much 
less the internet—is intermittent, I'm not going to be able to address the 
arguments in _Avatar_ thread for a couple of days.  I will do so soon, 
though, as I value your new low opinion of me.

That is the biggest piece of racist paraphernalia I have ever seen.
