I'm trying to scan the Jaka/Mr. Withers exchanges, but my scanner refuses to render any detail.  It's all black blocks and white chunks, which ruins the effect.  Needless to say, once I figure this out—hopefully tonight, but even I wouldn't bank on my technowizardological talents anymore—I'll slap the next post up there.  I would do it sans scans, but as the visual differences between the typical _Cerebus_ panel and what we witness in _Jaka's Story_ bears on my argument, slapping it up here without visual aids seems silly.  So bear with me.

In the meantime, congratulate my friend Leon.  How many of your friends are featured on [the front page of the] (http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/501186p-422543c.html)_[New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/501186p-422543c.html)?_ (It is _too_ an honor.  You _shush_ now.)  I mean, if you're not a fan of MENSA members who are also [competitive eaters](http://www.ifoce.com/eaters.php?action=detail&sn=34), [professional baseball players](http://www.israelbaseballleague.com/players/playerprofiles/index.html?player\_id=6) and [swingers](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=1092541), then who exactly can you get behind?

Got a kind of a bleg for you (and others) at Mostly Harmless.  Maybe I should run it as a contest--who can write the best Hilton Kramer parody?  Going now to edit post....
