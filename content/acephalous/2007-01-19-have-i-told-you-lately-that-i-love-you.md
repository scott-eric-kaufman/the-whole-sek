Of course I haven't.  Maybe I should.  Last week you bought me [_High Society_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359078/diesekoschmar-20) and the first volume of [_Church & State_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359094/diesekoschmar-20).  Did I thank you?  

I did not.  

And the week before, when you [helped me better understand](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009VXBAQ/diesekoschmar-20) William James' [theory of emotion](http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/11/a\_console\_to\_make\_you\_wiip.php)?   Did I show my gratitude?

I did not.  

I was too busy ... looking [_ridiculous_](http://flickr.com/photos/avidmarxist/320518679/).  (Sort of like the "[avidmarxist](http://flickr.com/photos/avidmarxist/)" standing in for me, only much more so.)  This week many of you have helped me "[find a form to accommodate the mess](http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:mX3OCe\_t4D0J:www.johnbakeronline.co.uk/quotesother.htm+%!f(MISSING)ind+a+form+that+accomodates+the+mess%!&(MISSING)hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2&lr=lang\_en&client=firefox-a)."  What have I done? 

Thanked you privately and, now, publicly.  I have been revising it per your recommendations all week now, and I'll continue to do so most of the weekend.  

Those of you who missed out on accommodating _that_ mess need not worry.  I'll be imposing on you on any day now.

Did you actually get my Email about the chapter, Scott, or did your Email troubles recur?

I got and appreciated the feedback, I've just been lax in my responses due to, you know, The Pressure.  (Which still oppresses me, I should add, but in a good way.)
