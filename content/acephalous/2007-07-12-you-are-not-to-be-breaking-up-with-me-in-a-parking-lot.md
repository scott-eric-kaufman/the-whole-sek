Seriously, though, it's not like _she's_ in the parking lot. How could she know?

Sly silver-tongued dawg. He should exchange notes with Capt. [You Are Now Digusting in My Heart](http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/2007/04/04/you-are-now-disgusting-in-my-heart/).

Did he speak with an accent?  His lack of contractions is unnerving.

You've been reading the Wharton and now life is imitating art.

I like to think that the first unheard bits of the conversation go as follows:

PHONE: Sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you. Are you on the train? Where are you?

MAN: I AM IN A PARKING LOT!

PHONE: I'm sorry you're breaking up.

MAN: WHO ARE YOU TO BE BREAKING UP WITH ME IN A PARKING LOT!?!

PHONE: Uh, what?

Hmm. Difficult to see why anyone would break up with a gem like this, isn't it?

Tom, Meg and I discussed how I should present this so as not to appear racist, but yes, the guy's a dead ringer for Naveen Andrews (Sayid on _Lost_), and had a thick Indian accent. 

Dr. Slack, I thought of AWB's post too, and am amused she didn't, but thought of something else entirely.  (Though I thank her for that.  People are ... revealing in the immediate aftermath of a break-up.)

Scott, you don't know the half of it: I didn't even mention the ascot.

AW, he _did_ look like Sayid, so he's some sort of catch.  (Then again, he probably resembles Andrews in [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458072/).)

Now, I know why you got hit by a car in that parking lot - you were to busy listening to other "private conversations"!!!  

People just don't seem to realize when you are out in public, you should not use your cell as a form of private conversations because you never know who is listening and where that conversation will show up and the manner inwhich it will be misunderstood!

This charming gentlemen makes profanity somewhat fresh with awkward combinations.

Hmm. Well, okay, I'll admit that I could probably be induced to go out with a man who looked like Sayid. 

In fact, I don't think it would take much inducement at all. 

But, still, I'd say the person on the other end of the line made the right decision.

Whoa! He had some serious pent-up anger to deal with.

Oh, are you in a parking lot, honey?  I'm not breaking up with you, then, sweetie.  Why don't you come over and let me have sex with you?
