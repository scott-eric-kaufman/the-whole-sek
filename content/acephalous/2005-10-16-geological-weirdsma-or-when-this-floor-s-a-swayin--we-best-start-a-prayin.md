[_Pithy Prefatory Remarks: Lots of people read [Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/10/14/192647/57)._ _More read [Instapundit](http://instapundit.com/archives/026216.php).__I've_ already _replaced the wheel on that counter twelve times this weekend._]

Six years in California acclimates you.  [![The\_desk\_1](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/the\_desk\_1.jpg "The\_desk\_1")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/the\_desk\_1.jpg)There I sit at the desk pictured left (albeit in its embarrassinly cluttered mid-quarter state) when all of the books I've added to the piles you see start to sway.  My mind invariably turns first to the prospect of cats wrestling where cats ought not be wresting.  Then I turn to the bed and see all four cats, ears perked, tales interrogative, seeking the source of this sudden shaking and it occurs to me that I'm experiencing what the natives call an "earth quake." 

Everything slows down.  Things sway slowly and ignoring the unverisal impulse to survive I shout "I think the earth itself protests!"  The wife shouts back her quick concur and the next thing you know we're staring at each other from opposite ends of the hall thinking the same thought:
_Is this someone else's The Big One?_

It isn't.  (Not [today](http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ca/STORE/X10147909/ciim\_display.html) at least.)  But in honor of the small one located 49 miles SSE of San Clemente Island, I present the following quotations from John McPhee's magisterial _Annals of the Former World_:
As we could plainly see from the interstate, the rock now residing in that striped mountainside had once been brutally shoved around—shoved, not pulled, and with such force that a large part of it had been tipped up more than ninety degrees, to and well beyond the vertical.  Overturned.  Such violence can happen on an epic scale. There is an entire nation in Europe that is upside down. (50)

The declivity was by no means sheer, just steep—a steepness, I judged, that would have caused the vehicle, had it slipped off the road, to go end over end enveloped in flame at a hundred yards a bounce.  (106)

On the striated pavement of Algeria lies the till of polar glaciers. there are tropical atolls in Canada, tropical limestones in Siberia, tropical limestones in Antarctica. (115)

Certain English geologists produced confusion by embracing continental drift and then drawing up narratives and maps that showed continents moving all over the earth with respect to a fixed and undriftable England. (118)

The swelling up of mountains was described as an orogeny.  Ontogeny, phylogenry, orogeny—accent syllable two.  The Antler Orogeny, the Avalonian Orogeny, the Taconic, Acadian, Alleghenian Orogenies. the Laramide orogeny.  The center of the United States had had a dull geologic history—nothing much being accumulated, nothing much being eroded away.  It was just sitting there conservatively.  The east had once been radical—had been unstable, reformist, revolutionary, in the paleozoic pulses of three or four orogenies.  Now, for the last hundred and fifty million years, the east had been stable and conservative.  The far-out stuff was in the far west of the country—wild, weirdsma, with its welded tuffs and Franciscan melange (internally deformed, complex beyond analysis). (32)

And that, children, is why we stand in doorways when we feel the floor dancing.
