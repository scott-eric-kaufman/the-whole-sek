Walk up to any academic and ask them whether they think Scott Kaufman or Natalie Portman has the better the CV, and I guarantee__they'd answer that I do _sight unseen_.  [They'd be wrong](http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2007/06/natalie\_portman\_cog.html).  Granted, I've never shot babies in the head with lasers, but you do what you can to see your name in print.\*

\*Not that I _wouldn't_ shoot babies in the head with lasers if it'd get my name in print, mind you.

Yeah, she's a smartie. She's also one of the few people with an [Erdos-Bacon number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdos-Bacon\_number).

But which one of you two would look better [performing a lap dance for Clive Owen](http://www.nitrovideo.com/moviedb/closer/Natalie\_Portman.html), eh?  Come on Scott, don’t be shy.

Don't even get me started.  

Being a vegetarian, star wars loving, cognitive scientist  in training, I am not afraid to admit that Natalie Portman is on occasion featured in my dreams.  

I can imagine that if I shoot enough babies with lasers, we might someday travel in the same circles, but in reality she'll probably remain on that list of people who have a lot in common with me and who are both wildly more successful than myself and virtually impossible to realistically befriend.

She claims to be a fan of Roland Barthes, which may be true, but I'll never forget how she compared Dubois' veiled existence/second sight thesis to \_celebrity\_.  

Dubois:

[T]he Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world,—a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder."

Portman:  "Oh my God! I'm not black, but I know what it feels like!" 

So you got the upper hand, dude.

I recall there being some young CRT law student who wrote a letter to the editor of Allure, pretty much a diatribe takedown of young Natalie.  I think she probably has a mixture of pride and shame at making Natalie Portman cry.
