			All unicellular beings, such as the Protozoa and
the simpler Algae, Fungi, &c., reproduce themselves by means of simple
fission. The mother-organism may split
into two similar halves, as the Amoeba does, or, as is more common in the
lowest unicellular plants, it may divide into a great number of small
spores. In these processes it often
happens that the whole body of the mother, the entire cell, may resolve itself
into two or more children; at times, however, a small portion of the
mother-cell remains unused.  From this it follows that these unicellular beings
are immortal.

—R. von Lendenfeld, "The Undying Germ-Plasm and the Immortal Soul" (1891)
