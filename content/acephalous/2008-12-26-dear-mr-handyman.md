_I'm doing some last minute laundry before driving up to the MLA tomorrow and I was wondering, why don't any of the dryers ever work?_

Dear WHACK,

There is a very simple explanation for why you'll be wearing damp clothes in balmy San Francisco tomorrow: most people neglect to feed their dryer.  

Modern dryers are complex machines that require thousands of calories to dry your clothes.  If you starve your dryer of the lint it needs to survive, you foreshorten the life of the machine by decades.  

The average American doesn't even know how a dryer works.  Here is a dual-purpose lint collector and stuffer:

[![Lintrap](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0105369dafa5970c-320pi "Lintrap")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0105369dafa5970c-pi)

Note how pristine and lint-less it is.  No dryer on earth could dry anything on such meager rations.  Yet people insist on making them try!  The purpose of a lint collector is, as you might guess, to collect the lint from one load of laundry in order to power the next.  

Upon the completion of a drying cycle, a filter such as the one above should be overstuffed with lint on both sides.  The lint from one side_—_it doesn't matter which one_—_should be gently scraped and inserted into the lint depositor at the base of the dryer door:

The consequences of loading an empty lint collector into an unstuffed lint reservoir are dire enough
.  
To do so without taking the scraps from the previous cycle and violently stuffing them down the lint depositor with the lint collector is outright inhumane.

Here's a shot of a hungry pre-cycle dryer about to be asked to dry an entire load of laundry with the equivalent of _fourteen uncooked turkeys_ stuffed down its gullet:

Do you see how little lint is in there?  How is a dryer supposed to dry anything half-starved?  The previous user of this dryer seems to have scraped the lint depositor clean and _thrown the lint away_.  Remember, a healthy dryer requires as much lint to dry a load of laundry as the load itself produces.  If you expect to produce this much lint:

You must deposit _at least_ that much lint into the lint reservoir and deposit it in there like a man.  Only then will your dryer dry have the nutrients it needs to properly dry your clothes.
