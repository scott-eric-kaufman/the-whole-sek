## Tuesday Ode Day: Ode to a Faux-Tee

Between The Weblog's weekly [contempt](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/11/tuesday-hatred-31415926535898.html) and [contrition](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/11/friday-afternoon-confessional-be-still.html) I spy a gully.  I want that furrow further worn with embarassing enthusiams.  How do I propose to accomplish this?  With gushing odes to objects and ideas which under normal circumstances don't warrant odes.  As the title "Odeman Extraordinaire" appeals to my inflated sense of self-importance, and I figure at the rate of an ode a week I can earn it in less time than it takes most people to purchase a badly battered 1993 Chevy Corsica.  (Recent experience indicates such a purchase requires more time than anyone considers reasonable.)  Tonight I present the first installment of the Tuesday Ode, which I call "Ode to a [Faux-Tee](http://acephalous.typepad.com/afauxtee003.jpg)":
A face from nought, I dispatch this fool beard,  
    From chin and cheeks I shade, altering measure;  
On jaw Norelco chopped at four, on chops it sheared  
    At three.  Forsooth admit this tonsure  
Chills a soul to Kelvin's absolute.  
    But being that attractiveness to all  
        Depends upon the trimmed, not hirsute mug  
           Of one swashbuckling and "cute,"  
My "shavéd" face, displayed as at The Mall,  
    Wears its whiskers like a thug.

Oh for face of Pitt! or one which would  
    Be coo'ed emetic never -the, nor -any -less,  
I offer booty,  tho' be it understood  
    All piratanical, but I digress.  
Oh that my jaw had animate jut, like [Wayne](http://fs6.deviantart.com/i/2005/051/6/e/Contest\_Notice\_by\_Batman\_Animated.png),   
    Of bone composed, mandibular success!   
       This chin, my chin, recessed unto the pain;  
           Unless expert manscape, causes stress.  
That I might strut and feel so masculine,  
    I trim this faux-tee to a manly maximum.

It would read better with an acute accent on the e of "shaved."

Isn't it already implied?  There's no other way to keep the meter steady...but I'll add it, you heathens, I'll add it.  You may also have noted I fudged the rhyme scheme in order to make the Batman joke.  As Morrissey once sang, "I didn't realize, that you wrote poetry, I didn't realize you wrote such bloody awful poetry..."

Since Ben is commenting, I feel liberated to say that those 'O's should be 'Oh's, being exclamatory rather than vocative.

On the rhyme fudge: 'Oh that my jaw had animate jut, like Wayne'

I like this idea of communal poetry writing.  Y'all help me build a decent parody; I delete your comments; I get all the credit.  As commercials say: Brilliant!

It you want to change the pararhyme is the first stanza to rhyme, you could put the third line into past tense -- "On jaw Norelco chopped at four, on chops it sheered".  That preserves the chops / chops thing without actually repeating the word twice.

Excellent suggestion, Rich.  I also like the internal alliteration it creates.  We should do this every week, then vainlny publish the Butlerian results.

Sorry, I meant a grave accent.
