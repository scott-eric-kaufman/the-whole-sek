_SEK is at the Norco DMV in the "appointment only" line after having stood at an unmanned counter with the word "appointment" over it for much longer than he'd like to admit.  He blames the mislabeling, but that's beside the point, which is that a woman who looked an awful lot [like this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/american%!f(MISSING)lag%!s(MISSING)hirt.jpg), only older, cut to the front of his line._

**ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY:** I DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT!
**DMV EMPLOYEE:** Then I'll have to ask you to step to the back of the line.

_ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY heads toward the end of the "appointments only" line._

**DMV EMPLOYEE:** Ma'am?  The other line.

_DMV EMPLOYEE points out the window to the line that's snaking from her counter and around pretty much the entire building._

**ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY:** YOU WANT ME TO WAIT THERE!

**DMV EMPLOYEE:** That's the line for people who don't have appointments.

**ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY:** THEN I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT!

**DMV EMPLOYEE:** (_issues a blank, well-practiced stare_)

**ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY:** I'M A PROUD WHITE AMERICAN!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME WAIT IN LINE WITH THEM!

**EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM AREN'T WHITE AND CAN'T BELIEVE SHE JUST SAID THAT:** !?!

_To placate ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY, DMV EMPLOYEE gives her a ticket and tells her to sit down.  ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY sits down visibly satisfied in her exercise of X-treme privilege.  SEK, whose ticket reads "B 047," is called to Window 12 after about another an hour._

**SEK:** (_to DIFFERENT DMV EMPLOYEE_) Why'd you give that lady a ticket?

**DIFFERENT DMV EMPLOYEE:** Oh, we gave her a ticket.  She's T 099.  When they pull that, they all are.

I know you're paraphasing for effect and anonymity.... please tell me you're paraphrasing? 

Do mentally competent  people really say things like that in public?
