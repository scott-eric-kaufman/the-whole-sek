> (_In a small classrroom, a young professor is discussing an [R.P. Blackmur essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001JL0BVW/diesekoschmar-20) with a group of twelve or so students._)

> 
> **CLASS:** …?
> 
> **TEACHER:** Break his sentence down. What does “discombobulate” mean?
> 
> **STUDENT #1:** Bored?
> 
> **TEACHER:** So Shakespeare’s language penetrates the souls of women by boring them? (_two engineering majors giggle_) How do you amaze someone by boring them?
> 
> **STUDENT #2:** (_confidently_) It’s a technical term from Switzerland. Watchmakers call the tiny gears inside a watch “bobulates” (_beaming_) and what a watchmaker does is he brings the bobulates together, and “com” is the Latin for “together.” So the proper technical term for this watch here (_points to his wrist_), or any working watch, is to say it’s “combobulated.” But over the life of a watch, it gets knocked around, and the gears get unaligned, and when that happens the watch becomes “discombobulated.”

> 
> **STUDENT #2:** He said the Swiss wouldn’t be taken seriously if they didn’t keep the Latin in there, because “bobulate” sounds silly enough without the Latin prefix.
> 
> **TEACHER:** Isn’t “dis” a Latin prefix?
> 
> **STUDENT #2:** I didn’t know that then.

I still don’t know what Blackmur meant—nor why my rabbi conspired with The Future to punk me—but as the MLA approaches, I’m increasingly convinced that the first time I ever spoke up in class foreshadowed some ominous end to my academic career.\*  So while I’m not exactly sure what end this start augurs, I take comfort in the fact that Dickens didn’t know what he’d foreshadowed for Pip when he wrote the first installment of _Great Expectations_.\*\*  (Or he wouldn’t have written [two endings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Expectations#Thed \_ending).)

\* The other lesson?  Never trust the Jews.
  
\*\* Not that scholars have written much about this.  The only exception I can think of is [about] (http://books.google.com/books?id=IFWnCdWieOcC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=foreshadowing+serial+literature&source=web&ots=7IRHHNYG9S&sig=dldjtUWeI2yueX0ZvG5qeYBhVEc)_[Buffy](http://books.google.com/books?id=IFWnCdWieOcC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=foreshadowing+serial+literature&source=web&ots=7IRHHNYG9S&sig=dldjtUWeI2yueX0ZvG5qeYBhVEc)—_but that might be because I only dipped my toe in Dickensian waters.  (Work on Wharton’s serialized novels focuses on how she altered the plot or how she mimicked James, so even though I should’ve encountered something about it researching my Wharton chapter, I didn’t.)

I heart your teacher; I never can bring silliness and fascinating tangents back on track smoothly. 

And take heart! There may or may not be stuff for you at MLA, but MLA is not the end of the job season. There will be Other Things available after that.

I'm impressed that your prof a) gave you that much rope and b) didn't begin sniggering part way through.  Did they pull you aside afterward or leave you to look it up on your own?

First off, good luck at the MLA!

Second off, I really enjoy your being able to laugh at undergraduate you, especially in a way that shows that you are finally genuinely able to achieve on a regular basis the cleverness that undergraduate you only dreamed of.

If I didn't laugh at how stupid and arrogant I was an undergrad, I'd do nothing but cry forever.  This seems to me the better option.
