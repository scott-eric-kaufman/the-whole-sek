## The 2007 National Tragedy Bowl (According to the Announcers*)

As we near the end of the first quarter, the grief-stricken LSU Tigers—"still reeling from the devastation inflicted on the great state of Louisiana by Hurricane Katrina"—are trouncing the grief-stricken Virginia Tech Hokies—"still haunted by the tragic events of last April"—by the score of fourteen to nothing.  

VT quarterback Sean Glennon is having problems concentrating in the huddle ... not because of the 90,000 rabid LSU fans screaming at him, and not because he's facing the best defense in the nation, but because he can never rid himself of the memories of that tragic day.  He prays to God someday he will, but that day is not today, as he looks completely out-thought and over-matched by this LSU defense.

Meanwhile, God—paying very close attention to this game—has decided that the 1,800 people killed by his hurricane need mourning far more than the mere thirty-two people Seung-Hui Cho murdered before taking his own life.  

Of course, it's only the end of the first quarter, and He may change His mind.

**UPDATE:__**The Lord can count, apparently, and He feels worse about Katrina.  LSU up twenty-four to nothing.  Geaux Tigers.

**UPDATE II:** Three LSU linemen weighing a collective 900 lbs. stitched the Virginia Tech players a memorial quilt.  We all know how God feels about blankets.  Geaux Tigers.

\*Lest the hate-mail stream in: I'm not mocking anyone except the announcers here.  They've obviously been told to be "reverent" and are trying their best ... but their best entails turning a football game into a theological disquisition on the God's will delivered with all the complexity of freshmen who've hit more bongs than books.

Hmm... you forgot to mention the cute little tiger cub.

You want [adorable tiger cubs](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1104/535306020\_bef8ddfe4e.jpg?v=0)?  I'll [give you](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1037/1316928973\_246d94a3e1.jpg?v=0) [adorable](http://flickr.com/photos/emphasis/42241299/) [tiger cubs](http://flickr.com/photos/danakochan/643381134/).  (The fact that Mike VI's already 400 lbs. removes him from this category, so those are anonymous adorable tiger cubs.)

Total agreement here, the announcing on the VT opener was downright ghoulish.  Didn't listen to much of this one, but wasn't that pinhead Musberger calling it?

It was Musburger and the otherwise-unemployable Kirk Herbstreit.  Seriously, the man's a walking, talking refutation that QB's a "thinking man's position."  No, sir, not if Herbstreit can play it, it isn't.

Riddle me this.  How can USC beat unranked Idaho 10-38 and still be on top after LSU destroyed the former #9 VT?

I heartily disagree with you about Herbstreit; can you say what it is you don't like about him?  Any sample bits of non-wisdom?  His GameDay analysis has always seemed savvy, and his color commentary during the Cal-Tennessee game was great.  So was Musburger, I thought.

Now, regarding this one game…I don't think it's their fault.  The media always feels compelled to emphasize the "healing power of sport" story, and it was clear from the beginning of the season that this is what was going to be talked about whenever VT came up.  And it's equally clear that they can't talk about Virginia's tragedy without talking about Louisiana's, lest people write in about tragedy disparity.  Hence…

My main complaint about Herbstreit is that he's lazily inaccurate.  A former QB should be able to tell the difference between a 3-4 and a 4-3 set-up, yet he consistently punts it.  He mistakes nickels for dimes, then chides the QB for making the wrong call at the line.  I know he probably knows what he's talking about, but once he finds a narrative, he sticks to it.  Whether this is done purposely or not, I don't know, but it _really_ bothers me.  I mean, I'm looking at the reply too!  That's a 3-4 package with a safety blitzing from the corner, not a 4-3 with four linemen!

He did this _all game long_.  Perhaps it did have something to do with "the healing power of sports" being forced upon them ... but still, it's extremely annoying when your experts don't demonstrate, well, expertise.

OK.....If one more person talks about Katrina and LSU in the same sentence, they should be shot. It has been long enough since Katrina to stop feeling sorry about what happened. I am not saying this to be mean; I am saying it because I deal with Katrina people almost daily. This group of people are mentioned each and every day here and most people just don't want to here it anymore. VT has had its share of sadness, but please don't keep reminding them. They won't forget and they want to get on with life. Make a football game about football. This is what the colle wants to happen. Get someone to announce that really knows what they are talking about and not one that constantly want to make our hearts bleed, along with our ears.  Turn the sound off and call the game yourself, this would have been a better way to watch this week game.  GO TIGERS!!!
