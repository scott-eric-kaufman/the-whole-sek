I just [read this awesome new article](http://www.avclub.com/articles/sometimes-it-takes-a-while-to-see-the-bigger-pictu,103361/) about _Breaking Bad_ that said things like this:

The tone being set here is riddled first with uncertainty
 (“Where are we?”), then with pointlessness (“Who are these skaters?”), 
and potential hazard (“Why so fast?”), before finally answering the 
question the opening shot asked (“Why are we wherever ‘here’ is?”). Once
 Cranston moves to the crane shot of Walter White’s backyard, we’re able
 to place ourselves spatially and temporally.

We recognize the once meth-blue pool in which Pink Bear and Skyler 
White floated; we notice the absence of the Lily of the valley Walter 
used to poison Brock Cantillo; and we know that the second half of 
season five begins where the first half did: one year in the future, 
closer to Walter’s 52nd birthday than his 50th.

You should read its life-affirming affirmations of life, [speaking of which](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/09/attention-new-internet-tradition):
