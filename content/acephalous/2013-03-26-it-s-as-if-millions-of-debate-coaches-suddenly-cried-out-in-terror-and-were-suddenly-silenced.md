I’m just a teacher of argument, not a lawyer, so I’m only going to 
address the merits of these arguments on their merits, not their legal 
standing. To begin:

**JUSTICE  KAGAN:** Mr. Cooper, could I just
 understand your argument. In reading  the briefs, it seems as though 
your principal argument is that same-sex  and opposite—opposite-sex 
couples are not similarly situated because  opposite-sex couples can 
procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the  State’s principal interest 
in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is  that basically correct?

**MR. COOPER:** I—Your Honor, that’s the essential thrust of our—our position, yes.

**JUSTICE KAGAN:** Is—is there—so you have sort of a 
reason for not  including same-sex couples. Is there any reason that you
 have for  excluding them? In other words, you’re saying, well, if we 
allow  same-sex couples to marry, it doesn’t serve the State’s interest.
 But do  you go further and say that it harms any State interest?

**MR.  COOPER:** Your Honor, we—we go further in—in the 
sense that it is  reasonable to be very concerned that redefining 
marriage to—as a  genderless institution could well lead over time to 
harms to that  institution and to the interests that society has 
always—has—has always  used that institution to address. But, Your 
Honor, I—

**JUSTICE  KAGAN:** Well, could you explain that a 
little bit to me, just because I  did not pick this up in your briefs. 
What harm you see happening and  when and how and—what—what harm to the 
institution of marriage or to  opposite-sex couples, how does this cause
 and effect work?

**MR.  COOPER:** Once again, I—I would reiterate that we
 don’t believe that’s the  correct legal question before the Court, and 
that the correct question  is whether or not redefining marriage to 
include same-sex couples would  advance the interests of marriage as a—

**JUSTICE KENNEDY:** Well,  then are—are you conceding 
the point that there is no harm or  denigration to traditional 
opposite-sex marriage couples? So you’re  conceding that.

**MR. COOPER:** No, Your Honor, no. I’m not conceding that.

**JUSTICE KENNEDY:** Well, but, then it—then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan’s question.

**MR. COOPER:** Thank you, Justice Kennedy. I have two 
points to make on  them. The first one is this: The Plaintiffs’ expert 
acknowledged that  redefining marriage will have real-world 
consequences, and that it is  impossible for anyone to foresee the 
future accurately enough to know  exactly what those real-world  
consequences would be. And among those  real-world consequences, Your 
Honor, we would suggest are adverse  consequences.

Cooper argues, not in essence, _but is actually forwarding the argument_ that
 redefining marriage  will have real-world consequences that are 
impossible for anyone to  predict, but which include the adverse ones he
 knows will happen. Cooper fails freshmen composition. But what are his 
real concerns?

**MR.  COOPER:** Yes, Your Honor. The 
concern is that redefining marriage as a  genderless institution will 
sever its abiding connection to its historic  traditional procreative 
purposes, and it will refocus, refocus the  purpose of marriage and the 
definition of marriage away from the raising  of children and to the 
emotional needs and desires of adults, of adult  couples.

People might seek to meet the “emotional needs and desires of adults,
 of adult couples”? Why would the gays want the emotional needs and 
desires of _all_ adult couples to be met? What did they ever do to them? Who really matters here anyway?

**JUSTICE  KAGAN:** Well, suppose a State 
said, Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said  that, Because we think that the 
focus of marriage really should be on  procreation, we are not going to 
give marriage licenses anymore to any  couple where both people are over
 the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?  

**MR. COOPER:** No, Your Honor, it would not be constitutional.  

**JUSTICE  KAGAN:**
 Because that’s the same State interest, I would think, you know.  If 
you are over the age of 55, you don’t help us serve the Government’s  
interest in regulating procreation through marriage. So why is that  
different?  

**MR.  COOPER:** Your
 Honor, even with respect to couples over the age of 55, it  is very 
rare that both couples—both parties to the couple are  infertile, and 
the traditional—  

(Laughter.)

The men. _Of course_. The men matter here, because they’re the
 ones who can continue to be fertile in perpetuity. So the emotional
 needs and desires of couples are less important to Cooper than the government’s 
commitment to protect the inalienable rights of viable sperm. But I’m 
sure there’s no precedent about marriage and its effect on children that
 might be relevant here.

**GENERAL VERRILLI:** Well, they might try 
to make a different record about  the effects on children. But there 
isn’t a record to that effect here.  And the fourth point I would make, 
and I do think this is significant,  is that the principal argument in 
1967 with respect to Loving and that  the commonwealth of Virginia 
advanced was: Well, the social science is  still uncertain about how 
biracial children will fare in this world, and  so you ought to apply 
rational basis scrutiny and wait. And I think the  Court recognized that
 there is a cost to waiting and that that has got  to be part of the 
equal protection calculus. And so—so I do think that’s  quite 
fundamental.  

**CHIEF  JUSTICE ROBERTS:**
 Can I ask you a problem about—it seems to me that your  position that 
you are supporting is somewhat internally inconsistent.  We see the 
argument made that there is no problem with extending  marriage to 
same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex couples  are doing 
just fine and there is no evidence that they are being  harmed. And the 
other argument is Proposition 8 harms children by not  allowing same-sex
 couples to marriage. Which is it?

I wonder why Roberts didn’t want to address the argument that 
biracial children can fare well in the world? I can’t think of any 
reason why he’d want to avoid that issue. I’m sure he didn’t change the 
subject to avoid talking about the fact that _the sitting President_ might be relevant to the argument?

I don’t read a lot of Supreme Court transcripts, but I do teach 
argument and did do forensics in high school, so I know both what the 
former entails and what the latter occasionally requires, _i.e._ having
 to take the AFF or NEG of a case based on a draw instead of a deeply 
held belief. You have to argue the case you have to argue, I get that, 
but honestly? Cooper couldn’t have made a more unsympathetic case about 
an issue which, though it will be decided on other grounds, needed an 
argument based on something more sophisticated than bigotry in order to 
acquire more popular support. It’s not just a freshmen composition 
course he failed today.
