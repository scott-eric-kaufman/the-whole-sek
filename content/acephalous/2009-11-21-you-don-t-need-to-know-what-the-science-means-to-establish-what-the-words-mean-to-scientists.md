## You don't need to know what the science means to establish what the words mean to scientists.

Global warming skeptics are attacking climate scientist Phil Jones for [encouraging trickery in an email](http://www.anelegantchaos.org/cru/emails.php?eid=154&filename=942777075.txt) recently [stolen off](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/the-cru-hack/) [the webmail server](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/11/19/breaking-news-story-hadley-cru-has-apparently-been-hacked-hundreds-of-files-released/) at the University of East Anglia in which he wrote:
I've
just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each
series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for
Keith's to hide the decline.

Over at RealClimate, the skeptical response to the word "trick" is to [treat it as a colloquial](http://www.realclimate.org/?comments\_popup=1853#comment-142141):

		

					[]()
			

Trick:  
“a cunning or deceitful action or device; “he played a trick on me”; “he pulled a fast one and got away with it”  
“Something designed to fool or swindle; ”  
“flim-flam: deceive somebody; “We tricked the teacher into thinking that class would be cancelled next week”To which one of the hosts, Gavin A. Schmidt, responds:  
[Wrong](http://math.about.com/library/bldivide.htm). [Wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial\_fraction#General\_result) and [wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods\_of\_contour\_integration#Example\_.28IIIa.29\_trigonometric\_integrals.2C\_the\_general\_procedure).The skeptics [reply](http://www.realclimate.org/?comments\_popup=1853#comment-142183):  
[S]ince
this happens “often”, it would be good to see a couple of examples of
the word’s usage from other fields to understand why it is not
problematic.Schmidt obliges:  
Sure. It's mostly used in mathematics, for instance in [decomposing partial fractions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial\_fraction#General\_result), or deciding whether a number is [divisible by 9](http://math.about.com/library/bldivide.htm) etc.etc.etc.The skeptics [rejoinder](http://www.realclimate.org/?comments\_popup=1853#comment-142221):  
This
is nonsense. Both are examples of teaching or explaining concepts to
lay people. The first intentionally places “tricks” in quotations marks
to emphasize its non-technical use.The problem with
nonspecialists reading the private correspondence of experts is that
their ignorance transforms all the technical points into nefarious
inkblots. To continue with the example above, skeptical nonspecialists
encounter the word "trick" and ask for clarification. Schmidt provides
evidence that the word is innocuous, but because nonspecialists can
interpret neither the context of the original nor that of the further
examples, they redouble their efforts: now the rhetorical situation in
which the word "trick" is uttered matters; now the appearance of
quotation marks matters, etc. They are convincing themselves that those
black blobs represent what they insist they represent, and when experts
inform them that those are not Rorschach blots to be subjectively
interpreted—that they are, in fact, _statements written in a language that skeptics simply do not understand_—the nonspecialists look over them again and declare that [it could be a butterfly, or maybe a bat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rorschach\_blot\_01.jpg).  

To
my mind, the only way to convince them that the word "trick" operates
innocuously in the particular linguistic community of climate
scientists would be to demonstrate that the word "trick" operates
innocuously in the particular linguistic community of climate
scientists. Show the skeptics that on 11 July 2001, Jean-Charles
Hourcade [wrote](http://www.anelegantchaos.org/cru/emails.php?eid=240&filename=994859893.txt):  
This
passes first through ... a macroeconomic framework insuring the
consistency between prices and quantities at any point in time without
necessarily resorting to the modeling tricks relying on the
conventional neo-classical growth theory; these 'tricks' assume indeed
perfect foresight, efficient markets and the absence of strategic or
routine behaviours; new conceptual frameworks about endogenous growth
theory allow for such a move, but there is a gap between advances in
pure theory and empirical modeling[.]I don't know what
that means any more than I know the science behind Phil Jones's
statement, but I do know that this email demonstrates that the word
"trick" is used both with and without quotation marks in this
particular language community. Moreover, I know that even though the
information leaked was designed to be do maximal damage to that
community, there is still evidence internal to it that resists attempts
to mischaracterize the intent of its members. Should skeptics insist
that "trick" doesn't mean a quick-and-dirty way to explore some
possibility, show them that on 12 January 2008, John Lanzante [noted](http://www.anelegantchaos.org/cru/emails.php?eid=852&filename=1200162026.txt) that  
a
quick-and-dirty way to explore this possibility using a "trick" used
with precipitation data is to apply a square root transformation to the
rejection rates, average these, then reverse transform the average. The
square root transformation should yield data that is more nearly
Gaussian than the untransformed data.If, by some miracle, that satisfies them on the matter of "tricks," they will [start complaining](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/11/20/do-hacked-e-mails-show-global-warming-fraud/) about the phrase "hide the decline," which was, of course, the real object of their objection in the first place.  

Needless to say, I don't envy climate scientists the tsunami of stupid they're about to suffer.

Non-specialists on the internet using out-of-context conversations to bolster their predetermined conclusions? Shocking!

And the line between soon to be mainstream political discourse and conspiracy theories shouted by the tinfoil hat brigade blurs even further.

This sounds a bit like the rubbish that is spread about the Second Amendment which has to do with civilian control of the military and the prevention of a standing army, not some bizarre personal right to arms.  The Second Amendment was supposed to ensure a Swiss style military system with a small professional army and a large civilian defence force.

So, no surprise whatsoever.

You're missing the forest for the trees.  The problem is not that the email is written in technical jargon, a language the 'skeptics' do not speak, but that the email is written in British English, a language the 'skeptics' do not speak.

I was really bummed that someone posted about the [kernel trick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel\_trick) before I could on LGM.

Scott, I think the implications of these emails goes beyond a misunderstanding of the word "trick."  There seems to be consistent massaging of the data and a refusal to publish work that runs counter to the party line.

Endy says,

" The problem is not that the email is written in technical jargon, a language the 'skeptics' do not speak, but that the email is written in

 English, a language the 'skeptics' do not speak."

Fixed.

I wouldn't go out on a limb here Mr. SEK cause of this whole climate change was just too good to be true in a lot of ways I think to where I'm just gonna chew on a blade of grass and look thoughtfully into the distance, hair tousled by the uncertain and noncommittal breeze, a little wiser a little sadder but resolved not to allow my trusting nature to be so callously abused in future. Bloody climate scoundrels.

Strange how the ignorant will be ignorant.

Use and example from Math to explain something about English, and the oddest thing happens.

Que the surprise "Morons don't understand English or math"... I wonder why?

oh... I have it... because they are ignorant!

Why don't they understand English or math or science... hang on..

I think I have an answer to that one too.

Next you will be trying to convince me that they believe in unicorns and spirits! But something based on data, 'that' they have a problem with.
