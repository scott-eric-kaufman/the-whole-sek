I meant to post this a few weeks back, but never could figure out what to make of it.  So I'll ask straightforwardly:

The [Troll of Sorrow](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the\_troll\_of\_co.html) [approves](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/dont-know-much-about-history.html#1639414421704213922) of [Althouse](http://althouse.blogspot.com/)'s plan to remove literature from the classroom.  I'm at a loss.  Who does this speak more poorly of, him or her?  (Or is there no new low either can sink to, such that they cancel each other's vapidity out?)
