A friend forwards this old solicitation from writers to readers about what they want to see more of in comics:

[![Seeincomics](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115707481fc970c-500pi "Seeincomics")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115707481fc970c-pi)  

Pure ridiculousness.Â  Everybody knows that "City Problems" _are_ "Black People" . . .

I like "Pollution" a lot.  Yet it would take twenty years (I'm guessing) until Captain Planet came along to give the people what they wanted.

Though there was Swamp Thing.  Actually, much of this list reads like a directive to Allen Moore.

It's like a game of "which one doesn't belong" -- WTF is "Astrology" doing on this list?

The reader who strongy wants more whiffleball in his comic books but is only "fairly interested" in badminton and staunchly opposed to the playing of lawn bowling faces a conundrum.

How are "city problems" not "national problems"?

Not everyone in a "nation" lives in a "city".  One might also interpret it as a question of scale.  If you still can't see it, just check the same box in each.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have some space flights to attend to.
