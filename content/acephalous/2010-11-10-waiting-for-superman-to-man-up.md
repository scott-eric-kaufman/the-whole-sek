It goes without saying that Ben Shapiro’s [not a very talented writer](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/the-10-best-directors-in-hollywood.html), but reading about [his achievements](http://benjaminshapiro.com/index.php/about) leads me to despair for the future of America, because apparently it’s possible to graduate _summa cum laude_ from one of the best schools in the best public university system in America and still [write sentences like these](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bshapiro/2010/11/05/america-loves-manly-men-not-metrosexual-emos/):

More people will still shell out bucks to see Harrison  Ford (as long as he stops the metrosexual post-Calista Flockhart crap)  and Sean Connery than they will to see Robert Pattinson sans fangs.   It’s not because they’re old.  It’s because they’re _dudes_.  Men want to be them.  Women want to be with them.  They kick ass, take names, and don’t shave their chests.

I’m not about to defend Pattinson, but given that, prior to this  spasmodic outburst of cliché, he’d knocked other “metrosexual” actors  for failing to star in a commercially successful film recently, I feel  obliged to note that the _Twilight_ films grossed the GDP of a  small country.  He may think writing “sans fangs” undercuts my  objection, but it doesn’t: there clearly is an audience for actors he  deems metrosexuals, as is evidenced by the fact that Shapiro can only  paint actors as unsuccessful _when he deliberately ignores their successful films_.

A smarter writer would at least possess wits enough not to mention those films, but Shapiro is no smarter writer:

Four of Depp’s last five films not involving pirates have underperformed at the box office (the lone exception was _Alice in Wonderland_,  in which Depp played Jack Sparrow with red hair and slightly less  coherence).  Jude Law hasn’t headlined a hit in his entire career (_Sherlock Holmes_ was Robert Downey Jr.’s show, start-to-finish).

Translation: since some of the highest grossing films of the past  decade don’t count, these actors are failures.  Put aside the fact that _most_ films aren’t successful; put aside the fact that _anyone_ would look like a failure if you disregarded their successes; put aside  the fact that Robert Downey Jr. is, without a doubt, a man with  “metrosexual” appeal whose two most recent successes were playing a  metrosexual tycoon and a homosocial detective; put all that aside for  the moment and concentrate the sheer stupidity with which he presented  his argument.  He _wants_ to claim that audiences shun films with metrosexual actors or about metrosexual characters, but he _actually_ claims that audiences shun them, except when they don’t.  When don’t  they?  Why, in all these extremely popular and profitable films, none of  which count because he doesn’t want them to.

Now, if he were an honest cultural critic, he’d be concerned with the  actual tastes of actual audiences and try to understand how they were  shaped, but he’s no more honest a cultural critic than he is talented a  writer.  That said, his failed sophistry distracted me from my original  topic, Superman, about whom Shapiro writes:

I am constantly bemused by the attempt to re-set _Superman_.   The original comics are classic pieces of Americana.  The original  movie with Christopher Reeve was wonderful in almost every way—the first  forty minutes of the original _Superman_ is pure magic.  And the  movie is true to the comic book sensibility: Superman is conflicted  about his identity, and wants to tell Lois the truth, but he’s also  supremely powerful and uncompromising about his defense of truth,  justice, and the American way.

First, no less of a [leading liberal light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy\_Terror,\_Batman%!)(MISSING) than Frank Miller already [exploded that version of Superman in 1986](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563893428/diesekoschmar-20); second, this is a child’s understanding of the character that even [the children’s show avoided](http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/For\_the\_Man\_Who\_Has\_Everything);  third, those clauses after the colon reveal the gross limitations of  Shapiro’s conservative imagination, in that they suggest that no one  who’s conflicted about their identity could defend American ideals.  I  wonder what his take on gays in the military is?

All kidding aside, Shapiro’s adamant that Superman occupy the same cultural space as Donna Reed _et al._ He must live in the perpetual twilight of an imaginary Golden Age in which

Superman is sincere in his masculinity … doesn’t wax his chest [and] doesn’t whine about having to do his job[.]

Wait—didn’t John Nolte just tell me that conservatives [hate _Mad Men_](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/11/10/hollywood-reporter-pleasing-republican-necessary-for-big-league-tv-success/)?  So why is Shapiro idealizing Draper?  Guess he didn’t get the memo.  Probably too busy writing about a book he hasn’t read:

Fast forward thirty years.  Now we’re hearing that DC Comics wants to reshape Superman.  According to the _[New York Post](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/it\_new\_look\_for\_superman\_wWxd8MApuHBFBmh0b3a4eK)_ the Man of Steel will now be “a conflicted 20-year-old who’s trying to  find his way in the world … He wears hoodies, has smoldering eyes and,  as a lanky Clark Kent, wears low-cut pants and hipster skinny ties.”

Even more disturbingly, according to CNSNews.com, the new Superman  will be an emissary of the international way which presumably will be  more in line with multicultural norms and practices. “I was raised in  this country. I believe in this country,” Supermetroman will say.  “Does  it have its flaws? Yes. Does it have its moments of greatness? Yes.  Bottom line is, it’s my home and I’ll always carry those values around  with me. But if I do what I can do just for the U.S., it’s going to  destabilize the whole world. It could even lead to war.”

Yeah, that has best-seller written all-over it.

Actually, [it does](http://www.diamondcomics.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=3&s=237&ai=102223&ssd=),  and to return to my earlier point, if Shapiro honestly wanted to  understand the culture he’s so feebly critiquing, he’d account for that.   I’ll address the actual content of the book tomorrow, you know, like a  right proper cultural critic and all.

Superman is the consummate New Deal American.

Now there is a takedown (I feel self-conscious writing that because I know that blogs in which the comment section consist of people congratulating the author on how effectively he attacks his target are inevitable terrible but, still, a charmingly vicious post).

And the title of the post made me chuckle.

Meh. I'd say that Captain America is the consumate New Deal American - Hell's Kitchen Irish Catholic, longshoreman father (i.e, almost damn guaranteed to have voted for FDR), unemployed artist (highly likely to have been involved in either the Cultural Front or the WPA), anti-fascist.

Also, if I recall correctly, there was a Superman/Swamp Thing crossover where Superman gets hit by a red-star plant thing that knocks him out and causes him to get very hairy, leading him to use his heat vision and a part of his space ship to shave his face and chest.
