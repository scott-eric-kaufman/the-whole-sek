Or, another installment of "SEK yet again looks at everything that isn't his webcam, while [_Race for the Iron Throne_](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/)'s Attewell just looks composed, only this time SEK also looks like a Soderberghian Smurf." (He's not doing himself any favors here.) This podcast discusses, among other things, gender and violence, sex and manipulation, time travel, Batman, and Attewell's amazing ability to corral SEK's dithering into almost topical blather. (Also, the punchline to that pointless joke SEK made [can be found here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/04/the-sad-fate-of-minor-characters-in-voluminous-tomes.html). It may make its way into an argument eventually, but that day is not today.) Enjoy!
