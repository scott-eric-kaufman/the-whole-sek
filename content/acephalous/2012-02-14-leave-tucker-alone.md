Lemieux [claims](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/02/tucker-still-drowning-in-the-great-sewer-of-fail) that Tucker Carlson’s investigation into MMFA found no evidence worthy of being called such, but he is wrong. [For example](http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/12/inside-media-matters-sources-memos-reveal-erratic-behavior-close-coordination-with-white-house-and-news-organizations/4/):

During the 2008 presidential campaign, for example, author Jerome Corsi wrote a highly critical book about the Democratic candidate, titled “The Obama Nation.” The Obama campaign responded immediately with a detailed memo. The title of that memo, “Unfit For Publication” (a play on Corsi’s 2004 book, “Unfit for Command,” about then-presidential candidate Senator John Kerry), was the same title used by Media Matters just weeks before in a similar memo about the same book.

Does Lemieux expect us to believe that _two_people both came up with the _same_obvious pun? Take it from a professional literary scholar: the odds of two people both choosing to pun on the title of an author’s forthcoming book by referencing the last one he or she published are a million billion to none. Only a vast liberal conspiracy can account for such coordinated punning. Or, for that matter, [this](http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/12/inside-media-matters-sources-memos-reveal-erratic-behavior-close-coordination-with-white-house-and-news-organizations/6/):

The atmosphere in the office was considerably more tolerant on non-editorial matters. “There were these two folks who got caught [having sex] in the communications war room on the weekend,” said one employee.

“People came in, and lo and behold there were two of their colleagues doing the nasty on a desk.” Neither one was fired.

Take it from [a professional witness of illicit office shenanigans](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html): in the absence of a vast liberal conspiracy, it is impossible for colleagues to do “the nasty on a desk.” The laws of science forbid it.  The rest of Carlson’s exposé is of a similarly high quality: revelations about left-leaning groups leaning left and anonymous sources saying terrible things about former employers.
