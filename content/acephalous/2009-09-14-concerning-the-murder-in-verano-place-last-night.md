## Concerning the murder in Verano Place last night.

"[YOU ARE NOT TO BE BREAKING UP WITH ME IN A PARKING LOT](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/you-are-not-to-.html)," he shouted.  [She means what the fuck](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/happy-birthday.html).  

Graduate school, it goes without saying, is a stressful time.  You spend every waking hour toiling away in a hyper-competitive environment.  There is no opportunity to relax because there are no weekends.  Holidays are an excuse to do the work your adviser mistakenly believes you already turned in.  There are always grant applications and dissertation chapters to be written.  You would drown your sorrows, but your university offers you a monthly stipend that is only seven dollars more than the rent in university housing and three bottles of [two-buck chuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles\_Shaw\_wine) only go so far.  There are conference presentations to write and student papers to grade.  Because your stipend barely covers the rent, in addition to everything the university requires of you, there are commitments to other employers to be met.  

Domestic disturbances in graduate student housing are a common enough occurrence.  In addition to the two linked above are the many more I never wrote about: the argument on the landing that ended with a woman on the ground slipping in and out of consciousness, or the Indian couple on the ground floor whose fights began with the slamming of things and bodies and ended with a woman sobbing out an open window.

Even knowing all that, [the murder in UCI's graduate student housing community last night still shocked me](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/woman-irvine-shooting-2563821-suspect-cns):

[![09.uci.murder.091509.bbc](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5c540ac970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5c540ac970c-pi) 

That's not my old apartment building—mine is immediately to the left.  I'm not sure what else to say.  Now is not the time to be making larger sociological arguments about income and violence.  But there is something to be said about it.  For the moment, I'll conclude by offering my condolences to the families and friends of Rebecca Benedict.

Perhaps what hit home the hardest with this, was the many times I've heard crying, shouting, and throwing-things arguments in the parking lots and homes of Verano Place.  We all live close and are under so much stress (much of it, as you've pointed out, being economic).  As much as it doesn't surprise me that this happened so close by, I still can't believe that it happened just outside my front door.

_Now is not the time to be making larger sociological arguments about income and violence_

Horrifying and all too common. So now might be the time to make sociological observations about gender and violence. Men are dangerous. I think about this in light of the recent horrifying case at Yale, where the victim's friends and family spoke about her upbeat attitude, as if this were a protection against men. She wasn't killed because she was chirpy or not chirpy. She was killed because she was a woman and her killer (I'm guessing) was a man. So too for Ruth Benedict.

OK, Rebecca Benedict is the victim. Ruth Benedict wrote Patterns of Culture and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword. She was probably romantically involved with Margaret Mead. For a moment I thought the culture-and-personality school of anthropology had some bearing on the case.

Very sad story. Men are dangerous idiots.

[_You're right.  The article had it wrong earlier, but then again, earlier it had my friend Jana's address as the site.  Not a winning day for accuracy._]

 _We all live close and are under so much stress (much of it, as you've pointed out, being economic)._

That's the point I wanted, but didn't want, to address directly: that violence is tied to poverty, and graduate students are, by and large, poor; but that it rarely escalates, I think, because it's not a hopeless poverty, which is where the sociological observations fit in.  When a class is impoverished and there's little class mobility, you have an uptick in violence; but graduate students are, however delusionally, convinced that they're acquiring the means to move up socially, so there's little of the hopelessness that drives crime in, say, the inner city.  You get the coping-with-the-stress-of-poverty crime, but usually there's an escape mechanism of some sort.

_Men are dangerous._

Especially when they're armed.  I'm disinclined to speculate, so I won't, but the fact that he was armed but allowed himself to be "arrested" by his neighbors does say something about the gun allowing for the escalation.

It is nice to read the comments here as opposed to those on the Orange County Register site where a significant number of readers believe that this guy was "driven" to the murder by a "toxic" woman.  In addition, most murders often take place in the window of time after the woman leaves, and rarely are women the murderers.  It is also significant to note, that there are more female graduate students than male graduate students now, and that they are often victims of poverty, and mothers as well.  The whole idea that this guys would have had to "pay child support," as a motivation for murder makes me angry too.  I'm so tired of men paying for their children being perceived as some sort of punishment, when the statistics show that women, financially, suffer much more financial distress after divorce.

More troubling, were the comments on the Orange Country Register were from other graduate students.  Clearly, these ignorant, patriarchal stereotypes pervade academia too.

D. Barnes, under no circumstances should any human read the comments at a newspaper site (particularly a right-wing loony paper like the OC Register, but the NY Times isn't much better).  There's no faster way to lose faith in one's fellow man than to see what knee-jerk comments he wants to make about the news.

D. Barnes, having now ventured over to the _Register_, I have to second tomemos: unless you like cleansing your eyes with bleach, don't read the comments there.  They're infinitely more vile than your brief recapitulation of them intimates.
