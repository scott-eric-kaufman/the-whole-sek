## Spending Saturday Afternoon Being Stoned By Adam Roberts

Went to the library today to pay off fines and pick up interlibrary loans.  While waiting for the former to process so that the lady at the latter's desk could perform her assigned task without frowning and huffing and asking whether it would be too much trouble to fill out this seventy-four page affidavit proving that I had already deposited all arms and legs owed the University of California Regents—while avoiding that, I wandered the third floor in search of a rare (during midterm week) empty cubicle.  Finally I found one inhabited by a stack of books but sans any other scholarly elluvia, so I sat down to read some George Eliot.  

Two minutes passed before the shame of having possibly stolen some bathroom-bound undergraduate's cubicle drove me to look at the stack of books before me.  A couple of Twayne's _Guides to Sounding Like You've Actually the Read the Book and Mastered the Criticism_, a copy of China Mieville's _Looking for Jake_ and a copy of Adam Robert's [_Stone_](http://adamroberts.com/extract\_stone.htm).  I looked at that one suspiciously.  "Wait a minute," I thought to myself, "I know an [Adam Roberts](http://adamroberts.com/index.htm) who writes science fiction novels."  So I started reading it.  Then I stopped...  

...after an abosrbing hour.  I put the book down, rescued my hostages from the untroubled inter-library loan lady and walked home.  Then I ordered _Stone_.  (Yes, I know, dissertation.  And I'm on it.  But _Stone_ has passages in desperate need of underlining and, good egg that I am, I can't deface library property.)  Plus, his new novel is a tribute to Y.T. called _Land of the Headless_.  I expect those royalty checks to start streaming in any month now.

I'll have to read one of his books, assuming that he's the same Adam Roberts that comments here.

By the way, the excerpt from _Stone_ reminded me of [this](http://rebecca.hitherby.com/archives/000455.php).

Rich, if you click on his name and then check out his [links](http://adamroberts.com/links.htm), I think you'll be convinced.  (And I assume you use the word "reminded" very loosely here?)

Okay, I'm sold. Another author to read.

Of course, I'm still trying to get around to read Moneyball. And some more Mieville. Damn uncooperative libraries.

Roberts is also the author, under the name "A. R. R. R. Roberts," of _The Soddit_, a very funny parody of _The Hobbit_, and _The Sellamillion_, a not-so-funny (sorry, Adam) parody of you-know-what, as well as several other parodies I haven't read. He doesn't list these on the "writings" page of his website, for some reason, but he does acknowledge them on the "news" [page](http://adamroberts.com/news.htm), so I figure it's okay to mention them here.

Yep that's me.  Five novels out from Victor Gollancz, though not in the US; five parodies too, some of them (I agree) funnier than others.  Some novellas, a collection of short stories.  And you've never heard of me?  Ah well.  My sixth novel is _Gradisil_ due out early next year, and after that as Ace says _Land of the Headless._  But all this rabid self-promotion is making me dizzy, so I should conclude by saying "don't read me!  read somebody else!" and scurry back for my hole.

I'd heard of you, Adam, only the universe had never thrust one of your novels in my mug before.  I'm glad it did.  I may write about _Stone_ later in the week (here and/or on the Valve), since cultivating relations with working novelists is the sort of thing we ought to be encouraging.  Plus, I very rarely have the opportunity to gri...politely ask the person whose book I'm reading what they meant by this, this or this.  That may sound oddly unacademic, but I think academic accounts of literature often miss much of what goes into the construction of novels.  While some of that ("I wrote that shortly after a brick fell on my foot the day my Granny broke her hip") isn't germane, other bits could surely clarify some issues.  (How's that for hedging?)

Gri ...?  Feel free to gri.  With my blessing.

("Gri...n at?   Gri...nd my teeth in frustration and annoyance?   Gri...ddle over a hot plate?)

I _can_ say that it's an occasionally unsettling thing being an author whilst also believing that, in many salient respects, the author is dead.  But you learn to live with these things.

I think that the only people who really believe that the author is dead have never written anything.  Perhaps there are a few who believe that they simply like to engage in automatic writing or some such.  But most quickly rediscover authorial intention when you "misread" something that they wrote.

Scott, I'm sorry if my offhand comparison with Hitherby Dragons wasn't what you wanted -- I didn't mean to imply that Adam Roberts' excerpt was comedic, only that both start with a prisoner talking to a particular stone about empathy in an indirect attempt to manipulate his prisoners.

Arg.  I've been misquoted.  I'm sure that's what they always say, but in this case it's true; a twenty-minute phone interview has boiled down in such a way that it looks as if I'm talking absurdities.

The other person quoted has said that they were misquoted as well, according to the blog thread (my second link) where I saw this.

In general, talking to journalists is a special skill.  I recommend the following procedure:

1. Find out what they are writing an article about.

2. Think of exactly one sentence that you wish to have them put in this article.  Tell them that you'll get back to them a half hour or so later if you need time to think of this one sentence.  (It may be two sentences if you really want -- but you're pushing it.)  Naturally, pick a sentence that is difficult to truncate and place out of context.

3. Tell them this one sentence.  If you want to explain things to them further, or they want more explanation, say that you'll do so only if all of your other rambling is on background and can't be quoted or attributed to you.
