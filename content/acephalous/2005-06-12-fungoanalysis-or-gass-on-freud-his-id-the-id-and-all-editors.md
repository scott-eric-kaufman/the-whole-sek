[Forgot to [cross-post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/william\_gass\_on\_the\_id\_and\_its\_editors/#comments) yesterday]

Years ago, when I was an undergraduate linguistics major--who on account of the dismantling of the [linguistics](http://www.artsci.lsu.edu/ling/) major at [LSU](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/william\_gass\_on\_the\_id\_and\_its\_editors/www.lsu.edu), sought shelter in another department, [English](http://www.english.lsu.edu/),
with which his linguistics classes were cross-listed--I responded to an
English professor’s question about how much
“criticism” I had read with an energetic outburst about my
undying devotion to William Gass.  I was informed, brusquely, that
that’s not at all what he meant by “criticism” and
recommended, highly, that I hie my way into English 3024 and read
myself some “Criticism.” Being the lover of systems all
linguistics undergraduates are, I took to “Criticism” with
the same vehemence I’d once adopted [mud-riding](http://www.dakota-truck.net/MEET/dmlbbq03/pics/andy/Saturday/mudpit/038.jpg), [fungo-drilling](http://acephalous.typepad.com/drills.jpg) and [x-bar syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar\_syntax).  But my attraction to Gass never faltered, and for the past week or so I’ve found myself drawn again to [_Habitations of the Word_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/080148488X/ref=pd\_sxp\_f/102-9607103-5071311?v=glance&s=books).  In particular, I’ve found myself thinking about “The Soul Inside the Sentence” as an example of an [appropriation of Freudian thought](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same\_senseless\_ramblings\_slightly\_bigger\_stage\_or\_intellectual\_investments/)
that says something psychoanalytic about something other than
psychoanalytic theory.  “The Soul Inside the Sentence”
presents a more attractive application of psychoanalytic theory because
Gass grants it limited explanatory power:

Freud was certainly frank enough when he wrote at the
beginning of his essay on Dostoevsky that “before the problem of
the creative artist, analysis must, alas, lay down its arms."

By limiting the utility of psychoanalytic thought--by relegating it
to the status of productive metaphor--Gass unburdens himself of the
unwieldy psychoanalytic apparatus that demands accounting by virtue of
its size and complexity.  Gass pounces on Freudian metaphors
without having to swallow the system whole, allowing him the freedom to
discuss how Freud considers with his “_customary unempirical daring_
the passage of such [unconscious] material into our awareness”
(emphasis mine).  Or, likewise,"by pulling at the one end offered
us, how many silken scarves, like the tail of a kite so far away we
cannot see it, can be drawn from the sleeve of this incredible
magician?” Those things psychoanalytic thought illuminates it
illuminates; those things it doesn’t, it doesn’t.  (I
take this to be the heart of [Luther Blissett’s argument](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same\_senseless\_ramblings\_slightly\_bigger\_stage\_or\_intellectual\_investments/#1599)
on the aforementioned thread.) If I could find some way to properly
format the “exchange between the id and its editors"--in which
Gass hilariously progresses from “I want the pleasure of playing
with my genitals” to “All right.  ‘How do I love
thee, let me count the ways...’"--I would.  Instead,
I’ll move through Gass’ psychoanalytic account of literary
production desk-by-desk, beginning with “our hero--Frank--[and
his] desire struggling weakly for expression.  I WANT MY
MOMMY!”

**First Desk:** _The Superego and its Wastebasket, the Unconscious._

“The desk of the first censor is occupied by Ma, Pa, several
Step-Uncles, Foster Parents, God, the Orphanage, and Immanuel
Kant.  Its nays are categorical.” Frank’s desire for
the breast of his mother, seventy-five, is denied by the superego,
“that notorious dogmatist,” with a simple “no.”
So, “with his id at his elbow, Frank tries again.  He has
noticed that his hostess, Carol Cozycott, has a gently rolling chest
like the hills of Ohio and his dear mother of memory.  Her hair is
similarly long and dark, and her nose has a crease across it like a
dog-eared page.  She’d be a suitable substitute.  I
WANT CAROL!”

**Second Desk:** _The Ego and its Wastebasket, the Preconscious._

“Carol is your best friend’s babysitter, the official at
the second desk reminds Frank; you better not think about her now;
perhaps another time in a quiet daydream, preferably in the tub or the
john.  So the thought ("I want Carol") is thurst into the
preconscious like a dirty postcard in pants pocket.”

**Third Desk:** _The Ego and Its Second Wastebasket, Discretion._

“But Frank still wants his mommy and Carol still has her
cleavage.  Her pie, Frank can’t help noticing, is
treacly.  No matter.  His mother’s molasses pies were
always treacly too.  He’d better try to choke down another
piece.  The truth is, he probably doesn’t remember his
mother’s molasses pie, and the identification of the two women
remains obscure, but Frank has been well trained, and the censor at the
third desk hardly has to raise his eyebrows, because Frank isn’t
any more likely to say ‘Choke’ aloud than he’ll let
out his canary.  Instead, Frank says: ‘Carol dear, may I
have a little more of your lovely pie, please?’”

At this point in Gass’ argument, Frank disappears, replaced by
an actual writer far more likely to blink in the face of treacly
molasses pie than Frank.  “We notice,” says Gass,
“that some writers throw bits away and begin again, some patch
and piece, some pare but some accrete, so that if a sentence is wrong,
a setting, or a scene, getting it right means making it longer, or
scrubbing it clean, or starting over; just as when we have blundered
socially, saying or doing the wrong thing, some of us must follow the
foot in our mouth with its ankle, others blush furiously and fall
silent, others deny having uttered the offending sentences, as if
misquoted by their own ears, and produce new ones, more fashionable,
more politic, amusing, or more daring.” 

**Fourth Desk:** _The Class Historian._

“We know how anecdotes are removed from storage like old clothes,
spotted, brushed, and pressed, let out or taken in, and we carefully
lace the sleeve of our personal history with lies, which really are
revisions, until eventually a formula for the past is settled on which
(flattering or not) somehow suits us by concealing our nature.”

**Fifth Desk:** _The Town Crier._

“During stage five, the wish, acceptable to consciousness, is
inspected and usually rewritten once more to satisfy the demands of
public utterance.”

**Sixth Desk:** _The Teacher’s._

“What we say when we speak in public won’t bear much
writing down.  We hem and haw, backtrack, repeat, use preformed
phrases which have fallen out the mouths of radios or slid off screens,
piece our speech together out of sentence fragments, and instead of
punctuating pop our cheeks or suck our teeth or wiggle our eyebrows and
sometimes fingers....Puppies still, we go to school to be paper
trained.”

**Seventh Desk:** _Editors, Publishers, the Public._

And now, after describing in detail how psychoanalytic theory leads
to literary production, Gass hedges, saying “the complete child
must come forth in the whole man or woman who invests and shapes a
successful style, in a manner exactly contrary to the situation [I described earlier](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/why\_mr\_and\_mrs\_.html)
in which an angry teasing child reduces the adult to another angry
teasing threatening child, and this use of the earliest urges by the
most sophisticated can be achieved only if the powers that be can be
persuaded to pull back, approve and praise, because only then can
forgiveness be received in the peace and blessing of the great lines;
only then will the psyche believe that its impulses aren’t
satanic, that all is not lost, that the self has not been left alone
amid the debris of its own demolishment, the ashes of its anger.”
In the end, then, Gass counters the psychoanalytic metaphors with
metaphors of his own that deny the power of the “debris of [the
psyche’s] own demolishment.” It’s not a logical or
argumentative refutation, but a purely metaphorical one, and as such
cannot itself be refuted.  That’s the beauty and, as [Rich Puchalsky pointed out](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same\_senseless\_ramblings\_slightly\_bigger\_stage\_or\_intellectual\_investments/#1601),
the problem with psychoanalysis.  Fundamentally based on metaphors
of mind, it requires of its opponents scientific refutation. 
Gass’ refutation--cite Freud saying “before the problem of
the creative artist, analysis must, alas, lay down its arms” and
present a counter-metaphor--is no real refutation at all, but it points
to the limitations of defending psychoanalytic thought on any but
metaphorical grounds.
