## What's the Word I'm Looking For?  The Opposite of "Disgruntled"?

Searching for words costs me hours daily.  Today, for some apparent reason, I had my first choate idea in weeks:

Write "gruntled" and move along.  I abused myself of the notion that placeholder words work fine.  Thanks to my inelegant new nomers, searching for words became a tame goose chase.  I sat there at my desk, my clothes shevelled, my hair kempt and in a state of utter array.  I was completely capacitated even if my prose wasn't fully-baked.  Writing became a bominable task.  

I was off the lam.  When I advertently saw my advisor, I wore a short face and he gave me the warm shoulder.  He told me I've spent my time to much avail.  "You've finally brought a gun to the gunfight," he said.  It was concerting. 

I returned home and stopped working at a godly hour.  And now that I look at it again, what I've written is really quite trocious.  I'm at my wit's beginning now that I've bitten off only as much as I can chew.  This really was an easy nut to crack once I woke up those sleeping dogs.  

[_I blame [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060724412/diesekoschmar-20) for this post.  Handler has a quietly self-conscious style which makes the world of words a strange place.  Hence tonight's offering._]

The Opposite of "Disgruntled"? 

Hmm...I'm not sure. I haven't been anything but disgruntled for a while now. Let me know how the 'gruntled' works out.

The opposite of disgruntled might be contented.  

This is message has been brought to you by 'me being an ass'.

Very clever.

You are playing with a full deck of cards, and I am in full possession of my marbles when I say that.

Okay, so I while I had my marbles, I obviously lost my cookies. The previous comment was mine.

Hey, so did you know that "gruntled" isn't the opposite of "disgruntled," but the same?  Apparently the "dis" is an intensifier.  I looked it up in the OED once long ago, but I admit I haven't done a deeper search.

Just thought you'd be interested.  I know, I'm being pedantic.  I'll stop now.
