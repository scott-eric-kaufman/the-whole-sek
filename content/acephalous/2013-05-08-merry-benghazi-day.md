## Merry Benghazi Day!

When their parents tucked them into bed last night, conservatives 
knew they wouldn’t be able to sleep. Tomorrow was Benghazi Day! They’d 
been waiting all year and putting them to bed at 9:00 p.m. was nothing 
short of torture. They rolled away from the mocking light of their alarm
 clocks and tried to fall asleep for hours, but when they rolled back 
over the clock read 9:04 p.m. Four minutes!

How were they supposed to make it through the night? In a few hours it would be Benghazi Day, and even though [they knew exactly what’s under the Benghazi tree](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/05/06/weekly-standard-accidentally-disproves-central/193917),
 their imaginations were running as wild as Muslims outraged by our 
freedom. Obama would be impeached! The Democrat Party disbanded! Niggers
 and faggots rounded up and shot! Benghazi Day couldn’t come soon 
enough!

They trembled like old men with weak bladders every time they thought
 they heard those whistles blow. But sleep would not come. Visions of 
dead Americans danced in their heads to the sweet sounds of a gavel 
calling liberals to order. They tried [counting lies](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/08/Live-Updates-Benghazi-Hearing) but quickly lost track of which ones were supposed to matter. They [thought about the video](http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/08/open-thread-benghazi-hearing-in-house-oversight-committee/)
 but then thought better about thinking about it because it didn’t 
matter. All that mattered was that it was almost Benghazi Day!

They rushed downstairs and turned on the television. FOX was interviewing [Benghazi Claus](http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/08/cheney-on-benghazi-i-cannot-understand-why-they-werent-ready-to-go/)! Happy day! He reminded them that “[when we were there, on our watch, we were always ready on 9/11](http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/08/cheney-on-benghazi-i-cannot-understand-why-they-werent-ready-to-go/).”
 What an unexpected Benghazi Day present! They were so excited it took 
everything in their power not to shoot each other in the face.

But it was only 10:00 p.m. Benghazi Day was still hours away!

So they went on the Internet and spent the night [writing fan-fiction](http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/obamas-departure-predicted-as-congress-focuses-on-cover-up/?cat\_orig=politics).
 When they fell asleep on their keyboards they dreamed of a border whose
 siren song beckoned illegals and liberals into its electrifying 
embrace. They saw white men in the White House and women who knew their 
place. Choirs of aborted babies sang their praises to a God who was 
clearly carrying. They were dreaming of the day after Benghazi Day and 
they never wanted to wake up.

Because it was going to be sweet.

And I’m sure it was.

I’m sure it was.
