It's time for a movie - action adventure preferably.  Something meaningless and that lets you destress...

Take my advice...it works.

This sounds eerily familiar.

And I'm with Sine.Qua.Non on this one: at least try working on something else for a while.

Scott, what about looking at some of your well-received work from past seminars?  When paralyzing writer's block/despair/self-doubt sets in, this usually raises the spirits.

Other suggestions:  Side A of Let it Be, Young Frankenstein, Season 1 of Da Ali G Show, play with a Pomeranian, swim in the ocean, watch the Daily Show

"what about looking at some of your well-received work from past seminars?"

That's dangerous, M Schwartz.  It's much more likely to cause one to decide that one has never written anything good.

I suppose, Rich.  Personally, looking at past work reminds me that I can actually finish something, and that occasionally the finished product is decent.  Not great, just decent.

But I do detect a bit of sarcasm in your voice, and I'm guessing your comment applies mainly to brave Acephalous.

In part I was joshing, in part serious.  To quote a saying in a book by fantasy writer Stephan Brust: "When the water is clean, you see the bottom; when the water is dirty, you see yourself."  I do think that there's a clear danger, in re-reading old work while in a funk, of seeing only the defects in the old work.  If it works for you, then of course I wouldn't argue with your experience, but I think it might not work for many people.

Oops, that should have been Steven Brust.

I'm with Rich on this one - once I start losing confidence in my writing, it doesn't matter how well something else (or even an earlier draft of what I'm writing now) might have been received: the feeling will carry over to anything of mine that I read.

But writing is such a weird, intimate fetish - different things will work for different people.

Or maybe you'll end up here: [http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/main.html](http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/main.html) ( Scott especially will like this one).

Try video games or going to an undergrad. bar and hitting on some 21-year old... I find that either of those helps -- in different ways, of course.

Tim, no Tim, no.  I don't want people to know that I'm the lone Scot who graduated (UNGRAMMATICALLY!) By Bayou.  Thanks one more unbagged cat in need of herding.  

Casey, um, I think I'll have to stick to video games, since _THE_ Little Womedievalist might take offense to my hitting on 21-year old undergraduates . . . as might the university, for that matter.

N.P., I agree, knowledge of previous success just emphasizes the depth of current failure for me.  But then again, no one would ever mistake me for an optimist.

A.W. and S.Q.N., I won't ever _admit_ to taking your advice and watching _Constantine_, but that has more to do with it than you.

Mike, one day you and I will have to talk about my aversion, nay! hatred of sand.  

And pomeranians.  An hour with a yapping ball of fur would send me flying out the window whatever-organ-whose-injury-would-kill-me-the-deadest first.

Pomeranians yappy?  Occasionally, yes.  But they also smile.  Constantly.  It's as though they intensely believe in a certain Bobby McFerrin song.
