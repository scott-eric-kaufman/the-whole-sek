&gt; do ANYTHING not dissertation related

I don't understand that.

Your cat cocks its head quizzically and looks at you.

&gt; write funny blog then  

The novelty of your original post wears thin.  Your readers decide to frequent other blogs instead.  No one reads you anymore and you are alone.  There is a pile of dirty dishes in the kitchen.    

&gt; plead with ca

YOUR CAT WILL NOT DO THEM.  YOU WILL NOT WRITE FUNNY BLOG TONIGHT.  DO NOT COMPEL ME TO PUT AN ELVISH SWORD OF GREAT ANTIQUITY BEFORE YOU.  YOU WILL REGRET IT.
