5.  Big-Tooth, [a hominid](http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/BeforeAdam/)6.  Lop-Ear, his companion
7.  Red-Eye, an atavism
8.  Ab, [a man of the Age of Stone](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8stab10.txt)9.  Uk, a [paleolithic literalist](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/xposted\_from\_th.html)
10.  Oan, an early Shakespearean hack
11.  Wax-moth, [an agent of creeping socialism](http://books.google.com/books?id=eFgRAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA78&dq=kipling+waxmoth&ei=kfU9SJLJEpjwtAOJkP2vCw#PRA1-PA77,M1)
12.  Long-Beard, [the sole survivor of a capitalism](http://books.google.com/books?id=L1I4AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=london+strength+of+the+strong&ei=Q\_Y9SNbRCIPMsQPt79yuCw)13.  Afraid-of-the-Dark, one of his three nephews

17.  Three-Legs, inventor of agriculture
18.  Pig-Jaw, father of domestication
19.  Big-Fat, née Twisted-Lip, discoverer of God
20.  Crooked-Eyes, corn liquor magnate
21.  The Bug, first minister of propaganda
22.  Tiger-Face, chief of the jointed staff
23.  Long-Fang, obviously doomed socialist revolutionary
24.  Split-Nose, professional scapegoat

No real punch-line here, other than I'm amazed I'm able to take myself seriously writing about these folk.  (Or, possibly, an explanation as to why I really can't.)  Sadly, this is my strongest chapter, the one that should be my writing sample and/or job talk, but I'm thinking I should go with something else, like the one in which I prattle on about [a fish](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/you-people-suck.html).  

Crap.  I'm never going to land a job, am I?

I read "Pig-Jaw" as "Pig-Jew" when skimming this list.

So, could be worse.

Also, he wrote a book called "The Strength of the Strong"?  Seriously?

Aha! Yet another thing they don't tell us to think about when picking our topics.

Luckily, I'm sure you'll be able to purvey your blog into a thriving internet empire and support yourself through Amazon payments.

You'd better find somewhere that the rent can be paid through them.

Good old Three Legs, he was fast _and_ popular with the ladies!  Such a good provider.

I think you ought to make up a few additional ones, maybe slip them into the footnotes, just to fuck with the Londonites.

By way of suggestion:  

25. Swollen-Liver, a writer  

26. Talky-Face, his literary agent  

27. Lump-Ear, a pirate
