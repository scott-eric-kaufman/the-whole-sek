Regardless of period and specializaton, most literary scholars are familiar with the idea of the [Long 18

th

 century](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emr/index.php/category/reference/periods/long-18th-century/) (a.k.a. the only reperiodization famous enough to have [its very own blog](http://long18th.blogspot.com/)). 
Encompassing all things from the Restoration of 1660 or Revolution of
1688 (depending) to the 1832 Reform Act, this 172 or 200-year-old
“century” calls attention to the inanity of organizing academic
disciplines around arbitrary chunks of history.  I embrace such
lengthenings because they allow us to define epochs by meaningful
events instead of the meaningless march of time.  That Pynchon fellow [lately in the news](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;?xml=/news/2006/12/06/nwriter06.xml) captures this tensions in [_Mason & Dixon_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312423209/diesekoschmar-20):

“What Machine is it,” young Cherrycoke later bade
himself goodnight, “that bears us along so relentlessly?  We go
rattling through another Day,—another Year,—as thro’ an empty Town
without a Name, in the Midnight ... we have but Memories of some Pause
at the Pleasure-Spas of our younger Day, the Maidens, the Cards, the
Claret,—we seek to extend our stay, but now a silent Functionary in
dark Livery indicates it is time to re-board the Coach, and resume the
Journey.  Long before the Destination, moreover, shall this Machine
come abruptly to a Stop ... gather’d dense with Fear, shall we open the
Door to confer with the Driver, to discover that there is no Driver,
... no Horses, ... only the Machine, fading as we stand, and a Prairie
of desperate Immensity ....” (361)

This time “Machine” traverses the “Prairie of desperate Immensity”
indiscriminately, Pynchon argues—only human agents and actions can
punctuate that vastness with meaning.  Bookending periods between
significant events introduces that causality into historical time.  Thing is, with causality comes arguments about the provenance of
certain causal agents, ideas and events.  Should Romanticism be
included in the long 18

th

?  What about France?  French
Romanticism?
