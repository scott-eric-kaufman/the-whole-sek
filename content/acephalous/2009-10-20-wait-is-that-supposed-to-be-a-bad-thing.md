## Wait—is that supposed to be a bad thing?

One of you lot emailed me bits of a Warren Ellis script for one of the various X-titles—the perfunctorily racy "Emma" can only, I think, refer to Emma Frost—but given some of the email I received concerning my discussion of the ALL CAPPED verbosity of Alan Moore in [this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/teaching-the-overdetermined-image-.html), I felt I should share:

We're doing the steam-punk neo-Victorian thing, so we're doing corsets, gloves, chokers, boots, but we're also going to be doing long skirts (though, this being Emma, I'm sure she'd slit hers if need be). Let's have a teak carriage-clock type thing with a blank glass face (instead of a clock face) on the occasional table next to her, as she lounges and reads a hardback copy of _Story of the Eye_ by Georges Bataille. (Actually, she might read it in the untranslated French, so that'd be _histoire de l'oeil_). JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I'M TURNING INTO ALAN MOORE.

Ellis wants to be Hunter S. Thompson, so yeah.

Actually, Ellis is famous for a work in which his "Mary Sue" character _is_ Hunter S. Thompson.  There's a difference.
