[The](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/12276) [news](http://www.poliblogger.com/?p=8370) [that](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/10/very-first-words-i-wrote-on-this-blog.html) [Daniel Drezner](http://www.danieldrezner.com/) [has](http://therightcoast.blogspot.com/2005/10/tenure-woes-by-tom-smith-like.html) [been](http://www.matthewstinson.net/blog/archives/2005/10/09/condolences-to-dr-d/) [denied tenure](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002353.html) will no doubt be _the_ topic of conversation for days to come.  Reactions have ranged from [the predictable](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005/10/daniel-drezners-tenure-denial-in-july.html) to [the insightful](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/tenure/).  The predictable will find some way to blame it on the blog:

		

					[]()
			

				There are a couple of tentative conclusions to draw, I think. One is
that it's probably a very bad idea to blog under your own name if you
don't have tenure.

Chicken Little, unable to see sky for his self-righteous cries,
considers the complex situation and draws some characteristically inane
conclusions:

How come Drezner didn't get tenure? Same questions, same answers, it
seems to me. Maybe it was the blog, maybe someone didn't like his
sister.  

In any case, if I were blogging under my own name,
expected to pursue an academic career, and didn't have tenure, I would
seriously reconsider the blog.

It must have been the blog.  Since he's as intelligent as he is
well-published, the only reasonable explanation of his denial is the
blog.  Arguments which assume the blog spelled Drezner's doom deny the
how dicey departmental politics are.  Drezner may be an internet
celebrity but an odd bird in his own department.  He may be intelligent
but, as some of those who comment their consolations acknowledge, the
department may be headed in a different direction.  Or
perhaps he angered one person on his review board.  Perhaps something
he had said at a faculty luncheon three years past had rubbed a reviewer raw and submarined his chances.  Because tenure reviews occur
behind locked doors, neither the candidate nor his readers know the
details.  

To claim the blog exacerabated whatever departmental divisions already existed reminds this
blogger of the days after Timothy McVeigh took down the Alfred P.
Murrah building.  Cries of "Islamic fundamentalists!" tore through the
media.  This repetition comforted all those who needed explanation. 
When proved patently false, those who had declared that fundamentalists had
torn down our sky shut their mouths and dealt with the more
complicated reality that an American had attacked Oklahoma City.  I
raise this issue not to declare these events commensurate, but to ward
the demons of false surety from the congenital conjecturers.  The
demons want your napes yet here you are augering this and that and
claiming academic armageddon has arrived.

But maybe it was the blog.  Perhaps departmental politics _do_ boil down
to some anti-blogger bone.  I doubt it.  Of course I could be wrong.  
The University of Chicago could publish a statement  explaining the Drezner denial declaring that they really wanted to award him tenure but were
threatened by the very thought of his blog.  Then I would have to step to
the plate and acknowledge that despite all the tangible benefits my
blog has brought me—the transatlantic emails from scholars I never would have thought interested in my project and the feedback from interested
but not formal academic parties—the
dissertation improvements don't outweigh the mere fact of
blogging.  

Grant all that.  What matters is the opinion of your material held by the people
you have sell it to.  Drezner may have—I'm not qualified to judge—produced
material of the highest caliber at an institution which did not value
it.  Or he rubbed someone the wrong way at a faculty party three years
previously.

We could think through this.  Or we could jump to conclusions.  Sans evidence.  Sans testimony.  But with a full plate of prejudice.  Feel free to do so.  I, for one, decline.

But these are even poorer reasons to deny him tenure than his blog! It hardly speaks better of academe to attribute Drezner's being denied tenure to stuff such as this. Does it?

It may not speak well of academe, but it's not uncommon to hear of tenure reviews which become little more than ritualistic "[Airing of Grievances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus)."  I'm not saying this is a good thing, mind you, or particular to academia.  It's something I've encountered in the highly touted "real world" as well: favoritism, intellectual nepotism, &c.  But I can't deny that the blog will be blamed for a decision whose contours are invisible to us...which is all I really meant to say.  Should I delete this entry already?  Surely it isn't archived anywhere yet...

Now you're linking and quoting JB?

I see no reason to even speculate about whether more-or-less illegitimate factors, like departmental politics, were a factor.  None of us are qualified to judge whether his work was actually good enough to get him tenure at a top economics university.  Blog exaltation of the form that says that since he's a popular blogger he must really deserve tenure is just as bad as blog denigration that says that you'd better not blog if you want a job.

I agree that linking to JB is a bad idea; it just ups his number of hits and encourages his idiocy.

But anyhow, I'd be interested in knowing what percentage of faculty actually get tenure at U. of C.  At some universities (i.e., Stanford, Yale, Harvard), virtually no junior faculty get tenure.  The idea being that you use your job there as a springboard to get a tenured position somewhere else.  These, of course, are Ivy League whereas U. of C. is not, but the point is that there may be institutional factors at work above and beyond departmental politics.

The point about Ivy League schools may be more about some particularly Ivy tradition rather than about quality, but if it's about quality, then I don't see any difference.  It's not like there are many university economics departments that have schools of thought named after them.

Er, Drezner is in poli sci, not English.

It's possible to get tenure at the U of C, which doesn't  operate on the same system as Harvard, Princeton, or Yale; however, it's also quite difficult.  The departments at the U of C keep close tabs on _what_ the junior faculty write--not just _how much_--and senior faculty expect their comments to be taken seriously.   All of the departments/schools/committees have recognizable "identities" or "profiles," as it were.  While I was there, at least two people (one in English) lost their tenure bids partly because they decided to ignore their colleagues; both of them promptly found jobs elsewhere.  And as one professor in the English department discovered, having a book from Cambridge wasn't enough to make it past his third-year contract renewal!

Thanks for the link.  You'd have more credibility, though, if you double-checked and spelled Drezner's name correctly.  Oddly, it's correct in the piece of mine that you quote, but not in your post!

Miriam,

Your comment looks strange now that I've shooed the trolls away.  Let this be an indication as to why.  As for the rest, if anyone should have insight into departmental politics at U. of C., it's you.  I expect a report on my desk by 7 PM sharp.

Rich and Stephen,

Linking to Bruce wasn't my intent, but when I ran a technorati search, his name popped up.  Misspelling Drezner's name also wasn't my intent, but at the very least it provides Bruce something to write about later in the week, when he takes up my challenge.  What challenge?  Why, thank you asking!  This challenge:

_...what I see is a series of justifications for why you aren't acting like a pompous little twit._

If I am a "pompous little twit," you should be able to muster some corroborating evidence. Because you can't--I have many flaws, but pomposity isn't one of them--I suppose your audience will have to settle for your patented argument-by-repeated-intimation. To wit:

_I'd still love to hear anecdotes of UCI English Department history; I'll bet there are many out there._

In the rest of the world, you don't back up a baseless claim with a supposition that you think your baseless claim's probably true. I mean, you can, but that doesn't alter the claim.

That said, I'm accustomed to the intellectual dishonesty you bring to everything you write, so I don't doubt that you can manufacture enough examples of "Scott Eric's pomposity" to prove that I'm twice the twit nobody (outside of you) currently considers me to be. So you know what I say? _Give me Hell! Give me the deflation I so richly deserve!_ (Just be sure you outdo [the number I pulled on myself](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how\_not\_to\_open.html). It'd be embarrassing if my "pompous" self-deprecation out-withers whatever you invent. One suggestion: quote the same excerpts from my Honors Thesis which I soundly mock and claim I wrote them yesterday. That'll show me!)

I know, why even offer it?  I knew he doesn't play rational, that'll he twist words out of sentences, sentences out context, and do whatever it takes, honesty be damned, to justify the decision he's already made.  But I think it's a difficult case to prove, one which, if undertaken, will _so obviously and evidently_ be the product of selective citation that I need never worry about someone googling me, finding his site and thinking it in any way, shape or form accurate.  Sure, he can call me incompetent for misspelling Drezner's name or dangling a modifier, but he can't say that I'm pompous without ignoring 98%!o(MISSING)f what I've written.  He can steal some quotations from some of my more formally academic writings (the recent and forthcoming engagement with Foucault, for example); but he will have to eliminate all self-effacement, all the asides, and everything which makes the prose distinctively mine.  If he does, that, _i.e._ attacks prose that doesn't resemble mine, I'd consider the matter settled (for obvious reasons).

That John Bruce sure does know how to spell.  Too bad that, in his comp. classes way back when, he never learned the rudiments of informal logic.  Or is that the senile dementia at work?

I tend to agree with Leopold Stotch that one of Drezner's faux pas was submitting the blog as a kind of academic discourse, which may have taken some aback, especially at a school like Chicago.  Ultimately, though, we cannot know why Drezner was denied tenure, so 99.9%!o(MISSING)f the commentary has been useless speculation (including my own).

Tenure cases are somewhat like rituals of passing or transition; there is a public dimension to them, yet what actually happens is a closely guarded secret. At least one way for an outsider to assess the case is to look at the tenure rate for Political Science at U of C. Then, compare D's public record with that of someone who got tenure. This may not tell you much. It certainly won't tell you the logic or let you see or completely grasp the moment of decision, but it could make the matter less mysterious.

On blogging: how did D present blogging? As academic work or as a hobby, pasttime, journalism? I have not yet heard anyone count blogging as serious academic publication and this strikes me as right (although this could change). It's been hard enough getting academic journals to count, or getting workbooks or workprojects formed as downloadable interactive packages to count (I know someone denied promotion when such a project was not considered 'publishing').

FYI "Anonymous" Troll: I've been tracking your IP address of origin both here and on the Valve.  I know that 95%!o(MISSING)f the time your comments originate not through a proxy server but through Verizon machine.  I know that this machine assigns you IP addresses in the 71.108.xxx.yy range, and that those addresses are assigned (according to [Geobytes](www.geobytes.com) to machines in the Lancaster, CA area.  In particular, I know that they are assigned to machines around latitude 34.7348 and longitude 118.1710.  I have cross referenced that latitude/longitude combination through Google Earth (not Google Maps, mind you, which doesn't show that information, but Google Earth) and by analyzing the IP addresses you've been assigned by that machine, some of my friends who work for the DOJ's [CCIPS](http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/index.html) division have determined that you live very close to Papa Johns Pizza and Taco Bell on E. Avenue J.  At this point you have two choices:

1.  Continue to leave offensive, harrassing and _threatening_ comments here or on the Valve and quickly find yourself embroiled in a cyberstalking suit in full accordance with California's [Cyberstalking Laws](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb\_1751-1800/sb\_1796\_bill\_19980925\_chaptered.html).  Your defense will cost money, and if found guilty--and remember, I've been logging your IP addresses for the past month, here and on the Valve, and thus have an abundant evidence of your guilt--you could be slapped with a $1,000 fine _per incident_ of harassment _and_ up to one year in jail.  (Keep in mind, you've not only threatened my life, but my wife's as well.)

2.  Of can you grow up, stop leaving violently abusive and threatening comments here _and_ on the Valve, and nothing will happen.  Continue, and after I've alerted Verizon I will report this information to the proper authorities.  The ball is in your court.

 scottystein I guess I missed the note that this was a private site, yidster---block me. 

I haven't threatened you, nor I have done anything illegal here, Crimefighter--but publishing my personal info, threatening me--that's a  a crime 

I'm just telling the truth, big guy: like yr fellow chesters at UCI, (got that?--"Chester," look it up, next to communist), yr a cheap lying, cowardly fraud like the rest of the UCI marxists

and since scum like you control not only the publishing rackets and newspapers I ll tell you here

I haven't published your private information.  I've provided you with enough information to indicate that I'm well aware of who you are.  I don't plan on publishing your private information if this continues; I plan on taking it to the DA's office.  (Look around the LJ department website and then ask yourself "Would a guy who works with a former _LA Times_ beat reporter and for an investigative journalist with ties to the state and federal judiciary have the wherewithal to 1) discover my identity and 2) bring to bear the full force of the law upon me?")  And for the record: Yes, you have threatened me and my wife:

"Hey Yid do your bitch yid clown-schtick while schicksa cooks the matzo balls.

"We know where you are. Your 'career' is about to end."

Then, of course, there's this:

"Hey Yid--

"when you see the red laser light

"duck, yuksmeister!

"heh heh"

I have the IP addresses both those came from, _and_ they're yours, _and_ they fall _well_ within the bounds California State Cyberstalking law.  For all I know you could be criminally insane (actually, I know you're not--yes, I've checked--but that doesn't mean you can't snap).  So criticize to your heart's content: call me a fraud, cheap, lying or (_snickering_) a Marxist all you'd like, but threaten me again, and you'll find yourself ass-deep in lawyer's fees _for years_.  (And before you ask, no, I won't: I have friends in the appropriate places.)

Also, you _do_ know that every time you post from the same proxy, I accumulate _more_ information about the packets' origin?  I now have evidence of the IP address your _home_ computer's assigned; I also now have proof that the same originating address has been assigned the same _proxy_ twice in the same hour...and in both cases to comment on _my_ site.  You're a former computer programmer, no?  Tell me what you think the odds of that random assignment twice happening in an hour are?

And just so we're perfectly clear: I have a lawyer monitoring this exchange, so you can't bully me into silence.  I know that I've revealed no information identifying (and, the illegal part, potentially falsely accusing) you.  I have indicated what I know, so that you know I know it.  Were I to reveal your name (which I know), or your address (which I know), or your Social Security # (which I know), or which state your brother, sister and parents live in (which I know), then you could counter-sue.  But I have legal advice standing over my shoulder.  _Literally_.
