## Dawg, We Is Underscrewed

_SEK walks into the liquor store and sees a painfully white undergrad, on his phone, trying to return fifteen or so bottles of prohibitively expensive liquor.  On the counter are bottles Bruichladdich, Glenmorangie, Gran Patrón Platinum, Johnnie Walker Blue, Chopin, Neisson Reserve, and Grey Goose.  More bottles are on the floor.  The UNDERGRAD explains his situation to the CASHIER:_
**Undergrad:** No dawg, you don't get it.  Them bottles wasn't for drinking.  They were behind the bar, yo, to impress the ladies.  But we served them shit.

**Cashier:** So you wanted your bar to look stocked and—

**Undergrad:** Now you feelin' me, dawg.  (_thumps chest and points at CASHIER_)  So yo, see, we put all this shit on our plastic and now we need to return it.  We had to impress, yo, so— (_points at bottles_).

**Cashier:** And now you want to return them?

**Undergrad:** Yup.  (_into phone_)  No man, dude says we cool.  (_to CASHIER_)  We cool right?

**Cashier:** Long as they're not open—

**Undergrad:** Not open?  Hold on now.  (_into phone_)  Says they need be not opened.  (_listens_)  That's what he say.  (_still listening_)  Hold on.  Let me gets clarifyification.  (_to CASHIER_)  So now you saying these need be not opened?  (_CASHIER nods_)  That's not what we just now agreed on when you said we cool.  Now you say we not?  (_into phone_)  Now he say we _not_ cool.  (_listens_)  That's what he say.  (_listens_)  No, dude, now we _not_ cool.  (_listens_)  Shit, hold on, I'll explain.  (_to CASHIER_)  So you know we had, see, you know we had to make it seems like we wasn't just stocked for the party.  (_CASHIER nods_)  Had to make seem like we always rolling, so my boy (_points at phone_) underscrewed some of them tops and corks and shit.  But nobody drank none.  (_loud tinny sounds from phone_)

**Cashier:** (_reaches for a box of Johnnie Walker Black_)  So you just _un_screwed this is what you're saying?

**Undergrad:** (_into phone_)  Hold, yo.  I got this covered.  (_to CASHIER_)  Look, why y'all accusin' us drinking the good shit and refilling them bottles with—

**Cashier:** I didn't accuse you of anything, but now that you mention it, I have an open bottle of Black back here.  (_brandishes two snifters_)  I pour some from mine here and some from yours here, they gonna taste the same?  

**Undergrad:** What?  (_into phone_)  Wants to compare and shit.  (_in the parking lot someone lays into their horn_)  What?  (_car horn continues_)  Can't hear shit.  (_car horn continues_)  Come again?  (_to CASHIER_)  Can't hear my boy.  (_turns and begins to walk toward door_)  Hold on, yo.  Be right back.  (_exits_)

_SEK and CASHIER exchange looks.  The car horn ceases.  A car door slams and another car_—_perhaps the same, but perhaps not_—_peels out of the parking lot.  SEK and CASHIER look at the bottles left behind._ 
**Cashier:** Think the little shit would've won my Pepsi challenge?

**SEK:** Doubtful.

_Chutzpah_ dead?  In _Orange County_?  No such dice.  Though technically speaking, it's less _chutzpah_ than rank stupidity.  I mean, the guy who runs the liquor store would _never_ be able to tell the difference between the stuff behind the glass and the cheap stuff.  _Never_.

_That's not what we just now agreed on when you said we cool.  Now you say we not?_

I'm sorry, that's chutzpah. When he gives away the game by accusing the clerk of accusing him of the switch, _that_ is where stupid comes in.

Never said you couldn't be dumb and chutzpadik at the same time.

Glad to see Philly is not the only place where "painfully white" young men do the "H-Dog" diction thang.  I was witness to a customer endlessly haranguing a comic-shop clerk about how comics are much better without plots 'cause then the Hulk get to smash more shit, all in faux-AfAm vernacular.

_Did he really say "clarifyification"?_

I had a difficult time figuring out 1) what he said and 2) how to transcribe it.  I think it was more like "clarifyingification," only with "g" elided.  But he certainly did say "underscrewed," as Mike -- the cashier -- stressed the "un" when he responded.

_I'm actually more impressed the person behind the counter was able to reference "Pepsi Challenge"..._

The cashier, Mike, is older than I am.  (He's also the part-owner, but I thought too much detail to stuff into the opening exposition.)

How do you know that those refilled bottles were full of cheap booze, as opposed to, say, urine?  I certainly wouldn't have tried them.

I was sure that cashier-undergrad exchange was headed toward a "dialect" problem, with the cashier having an Apoo-like accent.  Still, this is quite funny. ...I wonder if that was Kevin Federline?  I mean, you are near L.A. - TL

Unlike Flavia, this actually made me unhappy.

I was, indeed, delighted that "Dawg" fled in disgrace, but the chutzpah (as Ahistoricality aptly deemed it) just made me incredibly sad.

In a different store, "Dawg" would have gotten his way.  "Dawg" most likely got put up to this because it's been successful before.

Ans who's to say if "Dawg" and his "bros" won't do something to get revenge.

Oh, and don;t even get me started with the whole using\_the\_cellphone\_while\_talking\_to\_a\_real\_live\_person\_in\_a\_store thing.  That irritates me to no end!

Don't mind me though.  I'm just perpetually cranky.

It's nice to see that higher education is going so well in Irvine.  I'm sure his parents are happy with his language development and his honesty.  Nice to see the younger generation is better then the one before it.
