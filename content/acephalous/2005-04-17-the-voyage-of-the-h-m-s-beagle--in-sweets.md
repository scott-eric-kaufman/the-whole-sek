## The Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle...in Sweets.

Uncouth though it may be to mock earnest high school students who trace Darwin's voyage around the globe [in brownies](http://sps.k12.ar.us/massengale/images/darwin7.jpg) or [cookies](http://sps.k12.ar.us/massengale/images/darwin13.jpg), I can't resist.  I'm a horrible person for mocking a young mind who thought it "scientific" to draw Galapagos finches with [cake icing](http://sps.k12.ar.us/massengale/images/darwin2.jpg).  I'm a shit for laughing the efforts of one young man to construct a Galapagos tortoise from [a pie and five cupcakes](http://sps.k12.ar.us/massengale/images/darwin20.jpg).   Fortunately, I don't even know what to make of the [H.M.S. Beagle "pie."](http://sps.k12.ar.us/massengale/images/darwin15.jpg)  (Nor do I understand why the young lady felt compelled to shudder quote "pie.")  But what's really, really terrible is how I'm about to quote, verbatim, the "poetic" efforts of an anonymous student who, instead of baking, composed a tribute to Darwin in rhyme:
Charles Robert Darwin was his name.  
The evolution theory was his claim to fame.  
He studied theology and received his bachelor's degree,  
from a highly noted school, Cambridge University.

Darwin was a naturalist on a British expedition.  
To study plants and animals was his mission.  
The H.M.S.  Beagle sailed far and near.  
Darwin found new animals in places rare.

Darwin had a large collection of fossils.  
He knew that his finds were colossal.  
The fossils connected life old and new.  
And from this his theory grew.

After studying his organism collection.  
He developed the theory, natural selection.  
Survival of the fittest was another name,   
for the natural selection game.

The people of his time were shocked by his theory.  
Of humans from monkeys, they were wary.  
Darwin's theories impacted religious thought.  
And changed the science that was taught.

Darwin lived until 1882,  
but his work is still studied by me and you.

I'm just happy that an elementary school, somewhere in the United States, is still trying to sell Darwin to the kiddies, rather than pandering to the dumb-ass fundamentalist creationists.  If cookies and pies are what it takes, then damn it folks, let's start baking.  Hook those little buggers by the sweet-touth while they're young. Civilization is at stake.

Just imagine, someplace in Kansas right now, kids might be baking Devil's food cake Satans planting rice-crispie square dinosaur fossils for the abortion-seeking, marzipan liberals back East.  Until a gingerbread beast of the apocalypse slaughters them all and redeems the angel-food cake true believers.

Correct that - high school.  How can I expect to save civilization from the fundies if I can't even read?  Or distinguish a snot-nosed elementary school kid from a be-pimpled teenager?

Organic life beneath the shoreless waves  

Was born and nurs'd in Ocean's pearly caves.  

First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,  

Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;   

These, as successive generations bloom,  

New powers acquire, and larger limbs assume;  

Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,  

And breathing realms of fin, and feet, and wing.

Ray, since the other two posts were (amusing) spam, I initially thought yours was too.  Then I was sitting here grading a paper and thought "What spambot goes around posting excerpts from Erasmus' _The Temple of Nature_ on entries about his grandson . . . then came back and saw that you'd left it.  For a minute there I was convinced spambots had _evolved_.

Sorry for the confusion, Scott. I find revived old threads too attractive for my own good. It's like that thrill when you see that you're first person since 1953 to retrieve the book from the stacks. Those are the books I always want to write about.

I share your thrill at the prospect of lost gems, and to be honest, I've often thought of systematically reviving old posts in order to spark further conversation.  There's no law against it, and it's _so friggin' easy_, but the blog conventions dictate novelty Novelty NOVELTY! be the format's guiding principle.  People seem hostile to the thought of revision, as I note every time John re-posts a revision of one of his posts.  They shouldn't be, since revision is what separates careful scholars from curious cranks.  Bah.  Maybe it's grading student papers all day that makes me want to write a paean to revision . . .
