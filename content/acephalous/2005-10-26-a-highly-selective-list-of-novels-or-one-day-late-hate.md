Nothing surprises "the plebes"—I'm a [snob](http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005/10/snobbery-and-class-last-night-i-ran.html), see—more than the idea that those who teach literature haven't read every book anyone's ever heard of.  ("...of which anyone has ever heard.")  Reading over [Time](http://www.time.com/)'s list of Lev Grossman and Richard Lacayo's "[best English-language novels from 1923 to the present](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the\_complete\_list.html)," I'm at least comforted by the fact that I need not explain why an Americanist hasn't read every single page of _Clarissa_.  (I am amused the list starts in 1923 ... as if the thought of having to include the works of 1921 inspires inklings most vomitous.)

In most respects, this list is a far better one than anyone could have reasonably expected.  ("Committees smear shit evenly.")  Certainly, it has its share terrible novels.  _Something by [Cormac McCarthy](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,blood\_meridian,00.html)_?  [_The Corrections_](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,the\_corrections,00.html)?  [_Gone With the Wind_](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,gone\_with\_the\_wind,00.html)?  But the list contains enough idiosyncratically brilliant picks to keep my complaints down.  _[Watchmen](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,watchmen,00.html).  [Play It As It Lays](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,play\_it\_as\_it\_lays,00.html).  [The Day of the Locust](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,the\_day\_of\_the\_locust,00.html).  [Under the Volcano](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,under\_the\_volcano,00.html)_.  _[Ubik](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,ubik,00.html)._ _[White Teeth](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,white\_teeth,00.html)_.  To include important but terrible novels like _[White Noise](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,white\_noise,00.html)_ and [_On the Road_] (http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,on\_the\_road,00.html)encourages curt dismissals by anyone with a brain bigger than DeLillo's.  (I'm looking at you, Mad Rooster.)  And yes, I should explain the reasons I think DeLillo a trite, superficial hack of the Baudrillard school of "thought" or Cormac McCarthy a banal bore of Faulknerian proportions (as opposed to Morrison, whose debts to the Bard of Oxford, Mississippi are acknowledged and interesting).  But I'm too busy hyperventilating to do anything other than scream my untutored judgments at a world which wants explanations.

You see, there's a chance my department will break-up with me next year.  ("It's not you," it'll insist, "it's me.")  And if it does, that means no more group health insurance.  "Not a big deal," I already hear you saying.  "Just put your privies to the grindstone and pay for it!"  Well, I would ... only insurance companies don't consider one's cancer "cured" so much as in a state of permanent limbo they call "remission."  And they absolutely, positively cannot insure someone with remiss but horny cells.  Who knows what my mitochondria will get into next?  Who even knows what my mitochondria are?  Certainly not the idiot on the other end of the line informing me that my "profile" precludes me from coverage.  Is this reason 54,391,470,102 to move Canada?  Perhaps.  (I think I even know somewhere I can crash.)  Anyhow, I realize that you don't come here for the nightly panic attacks—the witherings and waverings of a stranger who lured you here with content but now bombards you with trifles—and so I promise I'll post more amusing conversation-starters in the near future.  This post takes the award for lamest post of the year.  Once upon a time I entertained people.  Now I'm just another pseudo-celebrity foisting my drama upon an unwitting audience.  Unfortunately, my drama lunches on the buffet of my mind like a beast from below with a love of all things slathered in Ranch ... and so other subjects fall to this side and that side and the wayside.  

"I mean," he says as he pushes his pointer into your private space, "have you ever woken up every morning with an implacable desire to fondle your throat for tumors that arrived in the night?  Have you ever had to live with the thought of your own death following you hither and thither like some grinning unmedicated psychotic?  No!" he declares, wagging an already invasive digit almost up your nostril.  "No!  You don't know what it's like!  You just don't understand!  I have feet to stomp and hands to wave in histrionic rebuttal!"  So instead of taking this schlock too seriously, dial up [_Disintegration_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintegration) (to [eleven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal\_Tap) if you please) and glimpse your glowering eyes below the fold and witness the horrors of _el teatro [chupacabra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra)!_

Hmm, too many topics in one post.

Books first, I suppose.  This list really shows the problems with evaluative criticism, I think.  The didn't make a list of "most influential" novels, they wrote "best".   That means -- to take the genre that I'm most familiar with -- The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe should not be on there; it's not C.S. Lewis' best book.  Ubik should not be; it's not PKD's best book.  

Then there are the choices that look odd because of what else they did or didn't include.  The Lord of the Rings I would say perhaps should not be on the list, but since they included Deliverance, maybe the competition wasn't that strong.  Snow Crash, and nothing by Bruce Sterling?  No.  Watchmen should not be on the list because it isn't a novel; if it were, then Sandman should be on the list.  And no John Crowley, no Peake, no Cabell, no Iain Banks?  I don't think that this is really a list of best books, it's a list of a few well-known, influential, "cool" books from each category.

Next, insurance.  You should definitely see a lawyer before accepting bland assurances of denial of coverage because of existing medical conditions.  I'm not one, but there are a patchwork of Federal and state laws affecting who can be denied coverage.  As for Canada, funny you should ask -- I investigated this rather thoroughly recently.  Got family in Canada?  If not, good luck getting permission to immigrate while in remission.  They generally want people within certain skilled occupations, in good health, with money, and not too old.  If you do just crash at someone's house, I'm not sure if they really will just treat you.

Alas, you need to be a citizen before getting the free health care.  And that could take a few years.  But you and the Little Womedievalist are always welcome to crash.

I'm sure our mutual advisor will work this out for you somehow, even if that means remaining in a state of suspense until the spring.  After all, it's at least partially his fault that we're such conscientous dissertators and can't pump out quickie chapters like the rest of them.

Rich, I'm certainly with you on the token PKD.  _Ubik_?  I don't think so.  I know I don't like _The Man in The High Castle_ as much as you, but at the very least _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldridge_ or _Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said_ should've been the representative PKD.  I can't, however, agree with you on the count of Sterling.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan, but in terms of quality I'd put Pat Cadigan on instead of Sterling; and _The Cryptonomicon_ instead of _Snow Crash_.  But yes, I think you're right to say that they wanted "representative" works instead of great ones.  I meant to make that clear in the post itself, but got carried away by the yelling.

Speaking of which, I think you're right about Canada, but the strange thing is...I've been a Canadian citizen before, and I believe (by which I mean "my parents have informed me") that's its easier to become Canadian if you've already been Canadian.  Sure, I was a toddler...and sure, I lived in the middle of nowhere (Canada, eh?), but still, if they can't accept one of their own back into the fold, who will they accept?  _Terrorists_?  I didn't think so.

Cam, I hate to say it, but on this count you and I disagree.  I've read Cormac McCarthy...and he is no Faulkner.  He tries really Really REALLY hard to be the Bard of Oxford (MS), but he's too masculine and confident.  He's the writer Faulkner would've been had he the confidence necessary to be bold instead of honest (to his experience).  I know I'm in the minority here (which is part of the reason I left it italicized sans explanation), but no matter how many people whose intelligence I respect force me to reconsider the merits of _Blood Meridian_, I still don't like it...almost compulsively.  There are very few books I've allowed others to convince me of their "greatness" despite my intense dislike for them, but McCarthy's one of them.  I've tried and I've tried and I've tried...but unlike Raymond Carver, who I've grown to love despite my initial knee-jerks, I can't overcome the faux-Faulkner plus uber-individualism and _the violence_ of McCarthy.  That's not to say I can't be convinced otherwise...which is my way of saying that it's up to you to show me the way (not in a Styx-ish way, er, you know what I mean).

Delillo is, for any interesting definition of "smart," smarter than you, Baudrillard, and the overwhelming majority of academics. McCarthy too, though I admit this is not as abundantly clear. Serious creative writing just requires a different order of intellect than clerical scholarship.

Yes, Jonathan, DeLillo may be smart, but he's a terrible novelist.  Also, I didn't think I was dismissing "serious creative writing" as something stupid authors do and brilliant critics explicate, so I'm not sure where that third sentence comes from.

_"To include important but terrible novels like White Noise and On the Road encourages curt dismissals by anyone with a brain bigger than DeLillo's._"

That was probably it.

The author of _Ratner's Star_ and _White Noise_ is not a terrible novelist. I favor some of his work more than others, but to simply call him "terrible" and make an unfortunate and inaccurate comparison to Baudrillard isn't worthy of Dale Peck. Why do you hold this opinion? Terrible relative to whom?

What I meant was "Why do you think my criticism of DeLillo extends to _all_ authors?"  Because it doesn't.  I admit to being flip above, but the person who wrote everything after about page 90 or so of _White Noise_ is, in point of fact, a terrible novelist.  The person who wrote everything after the first section of _Underworld_?  Also a terrible novelist.  Why do I hold this opinion?  Could it be that every single character in a DeLillo novel who doesn't speak in DeLillo's narrative voice sounds like a caricature?  Could it be that I find the persona behind that voice a little obsessed with its sense of its own profundity?  (Think _American Beauty_ and the plastic-bag-_is-art_ scene.)  And I don't think the comparison to Baudrillard inaccurate in the least: both have a deep desire to be thought profound, and both think their audience will mistake sloppy faux-profound statements for profundity; both have been told, for far too long, that their work _is_ profound, and so both have become even sloppier as the years march on.  _Underworld_ anyone?  Both also claim to describe the postmodern condition, and their work is often paired by scholars seeking to do the same.  I'm sorry, Jonathan, but if you can't see how DeLillo and Baudrillard's work dovetails, this conversation isn't really worth having.

There's a basic difference between a novel's alleged claim to profundity and that of a philosopher or social critic. The latter has more rhetorical constraints. Though I agree with you to a certain extent about Baudrillard, I think that "obsessed with its own sense of its own profundity" is just an irritated reaction on your part--not by any means a feature of the text itself. Reading the same book, I see an absurdist--even nihlistic--exploration of the limits of intellectuals and "profundity." My reading has the advantage of extending a benefit of the doubt to the novelist, a benefit earned by the sustained critical attention he's received, though also, generally speaking, a benefit that should be extended to anything you read.

What do you mean by Delillo's "narrative voice?" I mean this sincerely, because I see quite a wide range of variation between _Libra_ and _Cosmopolis_. If other readers haven't felt this reaction--or at least not as strongly--does it then mean that they lack your well-developed judgment, a critical discernment born of erudition profound and rare analytic acumen? Would you believe people telling you that your work was profound? If you allow the possibility that you yourself might be skeptical of your admirers, could you not extend this same charity to Delillo?

You're certainly right on the first count: Baudrillard irritates me immensely...but I do believe my irritation is instigated by the features of his text.  For example, take this passage from _America_:

I went in search of astral America, not social and cultural America, but the America of the empty, absolute freedom of the freeways, not the deep America of mores and mentalities, but the America of desert speed, of motels and mineral surfaces. I looked for it in the speed of the screenplay, in the indifferent reflex of television, in the film of days and nights projected across an empty space, in the marvellously affectless succession of signs, images, faces, and ritual acts on the road; looked for what was nearest to the nuclear and enucleated universe, a universe which is virtually our own, right down to its European cottages.

His rhetoric here doesn't jive with his function as a social critic; if anything, it's more pseudo-Nietzschean gestures in the general direction of the profound.  His rhetoric _is_ a feature of his work, and it does irritate me.  That you slipped from speaking of Baudrillard to "extending a benefit of the doubt to the novelist" points to part of my problem with him: it's easy to mistake his metaphysical noodlings for fiction and defend them on that account.  But they aren't fiction...although Douglas Coupland ably parodied thoughts of equal "complexity" in _Generation X_.  

As for DeLillo's "narrative voice," first let me say that I always forget about _Libra_ when I have this conversation, but that _Libra_ is the rule-proving exception.  Every other book he's written has the same world-weary narrative voice, one laced with nostalgia for worlds which never existed, one always pining, always empty at its core, always having to go to condom superstores in suburban malls in order to discover itself..._again_.  For the fifteenth novel now.  I could pull umpteen passages from _Underworld_, stick them next to passages from _The Names_ or _Mao II_ or _White Noise_ and demonstrate this (and perhaps later today, when this stack of papers in need of grading dwindles, I will), but needless to say his narrative voice, outside of _Libra_, always occupies two positions in his books: it is the voice of the omniscient or semi-omniscient narrator; it is the interior voice of the narrator (whoever it may be, man, woman, poor, rich, black, white, &c.) through whom sub-sections of his novels are focalized.  Whenever he wants us to sympathize with a character, the distinction between his voice and his character's collapses.  

Do I think my awareness of this means I've a refined sense of literary voice?  Depends on what you mean by refined.  Too refined to find pleasure in a Dan Brown novel?  Yes.  But my reaction isn't atypical, nor do I have to imagine it as such in order to defend it on its principles: Novelist A does this, Novelist B does this.  One is better than the other because he or she realizes their intentions.  If the intention is to, say, write in the voice of an uneducated, homeless African-American male, then I can judge the novelist on whether he or she has done so successfully.  In DeLillo's case, the answer's an emphatic "NO!"  The uneducated, homeless African-American male will either sound _exactly_ like the wealthy, Harvard-educated Caucasian male through whom most of the book is focalized _or_ it will sound like that self-same male in black-face.  In both cases, DeLillo fails in the extreme.  Now that I'm thinking about this more, I'll write something more tangible, less angsty along these lines later this afternoon.

Yes, you were.  Sometimes the call-and-response aspect of the comment section still confuses me.  I'll respond to your reading of _White Noise_ later this afternoon, then; I think there's an element of his wanting to both rib and steal the mantle of profundity in that book (which, as I acknowledged earlier, I don't consider a complete failure).

Stephan: "Alas, you need to be a citizen before getting the free health care. And that could take a few years."

I think that you start to get the free health care either zero or six months (depending on which province you move into) after being officially admitted into the country as a resident.  I don't think you need to be a citizen.  The process for being admitted as a resident is difficult enough.  And yes, I would guess that if you've been a Canadian citizen before, you probably still have dual citizenship or something.

I haven't been as impressed by Cadigan, although I've only read two of her books.  Any of \_Islands in the Net\_, \_Schismatrix Plus\_, or \_Holy Fire\_ by Sterling are, I think, better than \_Snow Crash\_.  \_Islands in the Net\_ is the archetypal cyberpunk novel with actual political involvement, which Gibson is too surface-obsessed for and Stephanson too techo-determinism-enthralled.  \_Schismatrix Plus\_ gets to cheat because it incorporates excellent short stories that are better than the attached novel.  \_Holy Fire\_ is an excellent example of a book that had to be written as SF rather than SF-influenced literature or fantasy, a convincing bildungsroman with a 94-year-old protagonist.

Rich, you did double-post, but Typepad's been twitchy all week now. It's been bouncing up and down as they switch all their servers. They claim it's all finished, but who knows, since that's what they said Tuesday.

If you don't want to move all the way to Canada, Illinois has a state-run health-insurer-of-last-resort program for those who can't get coverage otherwise, though I think it's more expensive than private insurance. There are supposed to be a limited number of places, but I got enrolled as soon as I applied. And I believe that other states have similar programs.

Adam, there's no way I that program could be any more expensive than what private individual companies are throwing in my direction.  (Upwards of $1,200 per month is about the average.)  But I think I may have this all worked out (maybe), or at the very least am not worrying about it as much now as I was before (although that may be shock).
