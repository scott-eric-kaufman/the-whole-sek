th
 is "[Racing Thomas Jefferson Night](http://nats320.blogspot.com/2007/06/racing-president-bobbleheads.html)" at RFK Stadium.\*  The Washington Nationals will face the St. Louis Cardinals, and no doubt the painful irony will be lost on most.

\*How many times have I seen that very phrase follow the colon of a "CFP"?  Being English folk, I can't count that high ... but it's more than I have fingers, I assure you that.

SEK,

I'm unaware of this racing-presidents-as-bobbleheads phenomena.  Please enlighten.

But on your intellectual notation, I'm not sure marketing folks in general deal well with irony - hence their taking and desiring jobs as marketing folks. ... My light apologies to readers with marketing credentials for blatantly stating my crass prejudice.
