As I waited to see a doctor, a young woman approached me:

Hello are you waiting for the doctor I'm waiting for the doctor are you waiting for 12:15 because I'm at 12:30 or maybe I'm at 12:15 and you're at 12:30 wouldn't that be uncomfortable so I'm here to see the doctor I'm here to see the doctor because I take Ritalin I just started taking Ritalin took my first Ritalin three days ago because I have ADD and I had this project due so I took another Ritalin because you can't have too much concentration but then I concentrated so hard it was 5 a.m. and I have an 8 a.m. class and it's better to get no sleep at all than just a little because then you'll be tired so I took another Ritalin for my 8 a.m. class and my professor said there would be a quiz the next day but I hadn't been keeping up with the reading because I'd been concentrating so hard on my other project and look at that man he's a nurse he has on green and so I took a few more Ritalin that day so I could catch up with my reading and be ready for my quiz the next day and then it was midnight and then it was 7 a.m. and I hadn't slept again but I did really well on my quiz but that was our last day on that book so I went home and started reading the next one then I thought about maybe how I should write a book but I can't write a book what would I write a book about so then I thought I should write a blog and then maybe my blog could become a book but I hate how people write on blogs and wouldn't read a book written like that so then I decided to finish the reading and took another Ritalin and then I met some friends from high school for coffee but I was so tired I couldn't keep up with the conversation so I excused myself and took another Ritalin so I could make it through the evening and when I got home I noticed all the dishes were dirty and I hate dirty dishes so I did them then I noticed the laundry was dirty and I hate dirty laundry and then I realized I hadn't slept in like three days so I thought I should come ask the doctor if I had taken too much Ritalin do you think I took too much Ritalin?

She shouldn't be on Ritalin. In people who don't actually need Ritalin, it acts like speed.

It's like that episode of Family Ties where Michael J. Fox takes speed and sleeps through his big test...

In about a hundred years, god willing, people will look back on late 20th century pharmacology more or less the way we look back on 18th century surgery.

Sylphslider, it's also a question of dosage, yes?  Someone who was perscribed ritalin for AD(H)D would feel focused but not wired at a normal dosage, but might have a different response if they started taking them a recreational level.

In people who need Ritalin, it has a slightly soporific effect---your mind stops racing, and you can finally concentrate.  I've never taken an upper for recreational reasons---mostly because I associate them with work, inasmuch as I only take my medicine when I plan to or am already working---so I don't know what would happen if I jacked up the dosage too high.  On the not-so-rare occasions I take my medicine twice---one of the drawbacks of ADD is that you forget you've just taken your medicine because you were preoccupied with other matters, so then you take it again, then you smack yourself on the forehead---the only real difference is physiological, in that I sweat a little.  Mentally, the effect's the same as if I only took it once.

_In about a hundred years, god willing, people will look back on late 20th century pharmacology more or less the way we look back on 18th century surgery._  I agree with the sentiment but I would say in" 25 years"  and "13th century surgery."

That woman does not in any way need to be in Ritalin, unless it acts differently in men and women and differently from adderal.  I have never had a prescription for adderal but I could take 60 milligrams of the stuff and mostly it would turn me into what seemed like a very focused zombie.  I moved slowly I thought quickly, but with focus and it was very hard to tear me away from one thing to another.  That ladies reaction seems like a normal person on speed.  Oh I could also sleep on adderal.

Scott and Parmenides,  

Thanks.  That's useful to know.
