. . . and then there is Nicolaus Copernicus.  He breathes nuance into the word fug—Hey!  Did you see that?  I _swear_ I saw him crack a smile.  Look at him _now_!  You can tell he wants to laugh.  Why's he suppressing a smile?  And—Wait!  What's he looking at now?  What's he spy over your right shoulder?  Breathe deep and whatever you do _don't turn around_.  Your ol' pal Nic' is winding you up is all.  There's nothing there.  

Maybe you shouldn't have called him ugly.   That was really uncalled for.  Don't try to pin this on me!  You _earned_ your fate my friend.  _He_ didn't want this to happen to you. 

_He_ thought you liked him.   Thought the two of you could hang out and discover important stuff together.  But you blew it.  Talking about him behind his back.  You should know better.  Doesn't matter now though.  Nothing you can do.  Now _you're_ the one with the behind-his-back problems.  

Ironic isn't it?

His eyes aren't even looking in the same direction!  

You should send this picture to Go Fug Yourself

Bears a striking resemblance to Lyle Lovett...

A sports radio station in my home town would occasionally ask listeners to call in and nominate members of the "all-ugly team."  So Patrick Ewing would be the center, Kent Tekulve would be the relief pitcher, etc. (Players of different sports could "play" together on the team.)  Anyway, Copernicus could definitely be the team heliocentrist.

At my philosophy class we voted Descartes the ugliest man ever, just goes to show the value of caution. Tell me, does anyone know if there has every been an ugliness contest?

Surely Thoreau would always win, hands down.

Not that there isn't \*something\* to the what, South Park vein of humour either, [mind you](http://pasaudela.blogspot.com/2005/04/stuff-of-mr-ripleys-talent.html).
