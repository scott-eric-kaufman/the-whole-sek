## Statements of Impurposiveness; or, as Gordon Gano Sings: "Lies Lies Lies Lies, Lies Lies Lies, Lies"

Digging through "My Documents" for some notes which have mysteriously vanished into the very bowels of my computer, I stumbled across my "Statement of Purpose."  You know, the thing undergraduates send to graduate schools to convince them that they (the students) are worthy of their (the graduate programs) attention.  Needless to say, it's terrible.  What it lacks in intellectual engagement it more than makes up for with its dour descriptiveness of my pretensions.  I've included it in its entirety below the fold, and _I've even corrected the typos, misspellings and factual errors._  

You heard correctly: I somehow managed to get accepted despite typos, misspellings and factual errors.  Anyhow, "highlights" include:
I am currently writing an Honors
thesis on Thomas Pynchon’s criticism of colonialism and its concomitant
domination of language in his earlier novels, _V._ and _Gravity’s Rainbow_.
In writing this I have had my first experience of what graduate work
will be like, and to be truthful, I thoroughly enjoyed the nights I
spent in the library reading, among others, Frantz Fanon, Michel
Foucault, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

We all remember [how well that turned out](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how\_not\_to\_open.html).
This is not to say that I plan on reading theory to the exclusion of
other works.

I should say not.  If now-me could travel back and inform then-me of where he'd end up, I'm sure then-me (a buffer if denser version of now-me) would challenge me to step outside.  
[I] have
started reading the complete works of George Eliot, a task I hope to
have accomplished in full by the time the Fall of 1999 rolls around.

I cannot be sure, but I think this may have been an outright lie.  Sure, I read _Middlemarch_ and _Daniel Deronda_, but that's far from the _complete works_.  (As Jonathan [likes to remind me](http://hnn.us/comments/66620.html), I'm still prone to such exaggerations.  They're well-intentioned whites lies, however, as they're meant to inspire me to transform them into big colorful truths.)
Those goals can and most certainly will evolve as I
learn more and discover new literatures and theories, which is what
excites me the most about continuing my education into and beyond the
graduate level.

Something _excites him_ about graduate school?  Obviously _someone_ has yet to spend a couple years toiling over a dissertation.

My word processor has become a graveyard for needlessly informative or
woefully inadequate “statements of purpose”. Some contain my life story
in full, some limit themselves to my intellectual history, while others
are narrative attempts at explaining “how I got to where I am now,” but
their imposed narratives rendered all of them little more than wistful
fictions. So instead of making more stillborn contributions to “the
story of who I was and how that man became this one,” I will tell you
who I am and who I wish to become while attaining my doctorate. 

“Who I
am” is a student interested in the more covertly political statements
made by literary works. For instance, I am currently writing an Honors
thesis on Thomas Pynchon’s criticism of colonialism and its concomitant
domination of language in his earlier novels, _V._ and _Gravity’s Rainbow_.
In writing this I have had my first experience of what graduate work
will be like, and to be truthful, I thoroughly enjoyed the nights I
spent in the library reading, among others, Frantz Fanon, Michel
Foucault, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. 

Over the course of my graduate work
I intend to further[![Pu](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/pu.jpg "Pu")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/pu.jpg) the study of literary and cultural theory I have
begun with this thesis (and in a modern criticism class I took this
semester). My theoretical interests are all over the map, ranging from
Jameson and the long Marxist tradition he represents to Lacan and the
better part of the Freudian canon, as well as where those traditions
collide, such as in the work of Althusser. To be honest though, right
now I am doing little more than dropping names. I read Jameson’s
_Political Unconscious_ and am in the process of wrestling with Lacan’s
Ecrits, and my knowledge of Althusser is limited to what I gleaned from
William Dowling’s introduction to _The Political Unconscious_. In other
words, what I have read pales in comparison to what I will read, and I
am well aware that my knowledge base is in desperate need of expansion.

This is not to say that I plan on reading theory to the exclusion of
other works, as I have a voracious appetite for fiction that theory
cannot begin to sate. As you could probably guess from the subject of
my Honors thesis, one of the people I am most interested in studying is
Thomas Pynchon, who also happens [![D400xii72](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/d400xii72.gif "D400xii72")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/d400xii72.gif)to be one of my favorite authors. I
also have a keen interest in James Joyce, stemming from a class I took
on _Ulysses_ from Patrick McGee last spring. Sometime during my graduate
work I intend on studying in depth the one book of Joyce’s I have yet
to read, _Finnegans Wake_. But my interests are not limited to so-called
“modern” works of literature. For instance, I have already spent a
semester reading Dante’s _Commedia_ and, with a little help from a friend
who has promised to teach me medieval Italian, I will someday soon read
it again in its native Italian. I also plan on studying more of what is
considered “canonical” literature, for if my forays into theory have
taught me anything, it is that there are strains of thought running
through even the most canonical works that demand they be re-read and
re-evaluated. To this end I have already re-read _Moby Dick_ and have
started reading the complete works of George Eliot, a task I hope to
have accomplished in full by the time the Fall of 1999 rolls around. 

My
interests are not even limited to what are considered “literary” works,
as a penchant for science fiction and other more “pulpy” strains of
literature has transformed itself into a desire to critically re-read
much of what I had previously read purely for entertainment. [![Philip\_k\_dick\_1962\_the\_man\_in\_the\_high\_c](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/philip\_k\_dick\_1962\_the\_man\_in\_the\_high\_c.jpg "Philip\_k\_dick\_1962\_the\_man\_in\_the\_high\_c")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/philip\_k\_dick\_1962\_the\_man\_in\_the\_high\_c.jpg)For
instance, I have written papers on Philip K. Dick, Kim Stanley
Robinson, and Bruce Sterling, a group of authors I might not even have
acknowledged having read in a statement of purpose a couple of years
ago. What theory has enabled me to do is to see the value in what I
otherwise would have overlooked, such as science fiction, film, and pop
culture, and to examine these things with the same tenacity I once
reserved for “literature.” What that basically means, for me, is that
even if I find five rejection letters in the mail in five months time,
the course of my studies will not be altered. I fully intend on
continuing my studies for the rest of my life, in the directions that I
have indicated above, as those represent my current interests and
long-term goals. Those goals can and most certainly will evolve as I
learn more and discover new literatures and theories, which is what
excites me the most about continuing my education into and beyond the
graduate level.

Thanks Scott - very funny.  I love the "meta" opening about the previous drafts you discarded because they imposed a false narrative upon your life and reading interests.

It can't possibly be a lie that you _started_ reading the works of George Eliot, given that you read two of the lengthier novels, or that you _hoped_ to finish this task by whatever date. Now if you had said _intended..._.

You've spoken about your "five-year rule." Here's my twenty-year rule: if you bought it at least twenty years ago, and you _still_ haven't gotten around to reading it, then either read it, or recycle it.

Scott, I had no idea that a statement of purpose with such a flippant, aw-shucks tone could win over the hearts of an English dept's admissions board.  Either you know something I don't (ie: that levity triumphs over no-nonsense studiousness), or your S.O.P. was not the most convincing aspect of your application materials.

Oh, and to read a UCI ABD's S.O.P on the very night I've sat down to compose my own, and to find in your S.O.P. something radically dissimilar to my (possibly) misguided notion of what an S.O.P. should look, read, and smell like, I am now mired in a state of (probably unnecessary) confusion, apprehension, and grief over the proper form/tone my S.O.P should take.
