## Andrew Breitbart has twelve hours to prove he's not a liar.

Remember how, exactly three weeks ago today, Andrew Breitbart [claimed](http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201002230001)
that he would "take down the institutional left within three weeks"?  I
wonder how that's going.  Before I left for the office this morning, I
could still suffer through three hours of _Morning Joe_, and when I checked the [website](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/)
a few seconds ago, I could still reach Rachel Maddow's blog.  (Nor are
any of his blogs trumpeting his victory.)  

How long do we have to wait
before we can hire [a tweeting-retracting mountain camel](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/02/we-is-a-serious-news-organization-what-demands-you-retract-tweets-now) to start demanding a correction from him?

I think it's a little churlish to hold people to boasts they make while they are coked up.

I was trying to find a way to articulate something and couldn't, but I ran across the [perfect line elsewhere](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010\_03/022882.php): 

_They make claims that aren't true, and after being corrected, either repeat those claims again anyway, pretend the matter is subjective, or both._

So, if it happens three days from now, or three years, they can say there was some dispute over what "three weeks" means, but it's just subjective. 

And even if it never happens -- which is, of course, much more likely -- they're entirely capable of claiming that it did, by some standard of which only they are aware.

A lie has three parts.

1. What you say has to be false.

2. You have to know that it's false.

3. You have to have the intent to deceive.

That's a reasonable way to put it, Fritz.  Happily for SEK, Breitbart's claim passes the test with flying colors.

First: I find that commonly people will simply abandon past claims, rather than attempt to defend them substantially.  The trick with making prophecies is that all of their rhetorical impact happens in the present.  They generate hype or concern at the moment they're made and are typically forgotten before long.  Political commentators often have their audiences pretty much to themselves; their audience doesn't even hear from detractors if the commentator doesn't bring attention to them.  So the safest thing to do for the commentator is to simply ignore anyone who brings up false claims that have been lost in the political news cycle, thus ensuring that most of their audience will as well.

Second: Actually I don't really agree with Fritz's criteria.  What you say doesn't have to be false, but you have to believe that it is. If I believe that there are 10 dollars in my pocket and someone asks me if I have any money and I tell them that I don't, I would still consider it a lie, even if later it turned out that there was no money in my pocket.  

If someone believes they'll take down the left in three weeks, makes claims as such, and utterly fails to do so, they're not necessarily lying, just deluded.

Fixed this for you, Ahistoricality:

First rule of prophecy **club**: Never give dates.

Second rule of prophecy club: Never give dates.

Third rule of prophecy club: _Never. Give. Dates._

Also:

So, if it happens three days from now, or three years, they can say there was some dispute over what "three weeks" means, but it's just subjective.

I don't doubt for a second that we're in for a heady dose of [postdiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdiction) from Breitbart in the near future.

Fritz:

1. What you say has to be false.
2. You have to know that it's false.
3. You have to have the intent to deceive.

I agree with your first two items here, but I'd alter the phrasing of the third to something like: "You have to want this falsity to have some sort of instrumental effect."  Prophecies---especially deliberately false ones---are intended to have an effect that stirs up the audience, and are said by the liars in question because they want to rile up their audience.  To me, this isn't mere lying, _it's something far worse_.

To me, this isn't mere lying, it's something far worse.

First, it's fairly standard political technique, used by [all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkWAhuXtalw) [and](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWusOhZpq7w) [sundry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io9KMSSEZ0Y).

Second, you might try ["Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment"](http://www.amazon.com/Affective-Intelligence-Political-Judgment-George/dp/0226504697) by Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen for more information.  They argue, persuasively I think, that riling up the audience is generally a good thing.  A riled up audience is more engaged, more interested, and more informed (it's been a few years since I read the book, but from what I remember they had some interesting data on this point).  To have a responsible republican government (i.e., representative democracy) you need an engaged electorate.  And, since we have enough anti-democratic institutions to cool the tea as Jefferson might have said, it all works out to a net good.

"3 part lie formula for liars" is the new "aware of all Internet traditions".
