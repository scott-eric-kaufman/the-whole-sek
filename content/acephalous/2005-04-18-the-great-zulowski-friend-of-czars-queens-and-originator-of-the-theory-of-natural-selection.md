All this time writing a dissertation on non-Darwinian evolutionary theory wasted!  Little did I realize that even Darwinian thought is, technically speaking, non-Darwinian.  I now have to run search-and-replace on everything I've written the past two years.  "Darwinian" must become "Zulowskian"; "non-Darwinian" must become "non-non-Darwinian," the first instance of which must now be followed by a long footnote explaining that this particular double-negative doesn't equal a positive, i.e. that "non-non-Darwinian" doesn't mean "Darwinian" in the way that -2 x -2 = 4.  Cripes.  All because Zulowski, as he attests in the Dec. 29, 1860 edition of _Vanity Fair_,  right there on page 319:
I was the originator of the theory of "natural selection," which Darwin has so boldly put forth of late, that I am surprised to find he is English and not American.  I published an elaborate treatise on the subject, seventy years ago, in the Polynesian tongue, with notes in Arabic.  I have been unable to find it in any of the poorly furnished libraries of America.

Zulowski, or as Longfellow called him, "Count Zulowski," lived a life most of his contemporaries couldn't imagine.
Sixty years ago next February, when Czar Paul was knocked in the head and strangled by a party of drunken revellers, so that Alexander reigned in his stead, if my advice could have been taken the bloody scene that followed (the fighting among soldiery) would have been prevented.  Alexander said as much to me over a game of chess.  I won the game, hence my hasty departure from Russia.

If the first passage is pure Borges--who, having not been born in 1860, is not likely to have penned it--the second is pure Twain, who I'm inclined to think penned both.  This is the only mention of a Zulowski in any of the historical databases to which I have access, and Google's turning up [fuck all](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&q=count+zulowski+&btnG=Search), so I'm left with one conclusion: Count Zulowski must have been a high stakes player in international politics who, having crossed Daniel Webster--who had offered him a position as West Point's top brass, a position Zulowski declined "feeling that in a country where the army was naught, and the navy less, it would be below my merits and qualifications"--having crossed, that is, Daniel Webster one time too many, had his name erased from the annals of American history.
