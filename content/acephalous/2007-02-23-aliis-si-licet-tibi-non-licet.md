While searching for some way to explain CR's [comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/no\_wonder\_i\_don.html#comment-61269942) to Adam, I stumbled across this picture, which I feel compelled to share:

![image](http://acephalous.typepad.com/Chicken\_Grim\_Reaper\_Large.jpg)

What, exactly, is that [Famous Chicken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_San\_Diego\_Chicken) up to?  

Is a professional sporting event really the best place for _memento mori_?  

Is the San Diego Chicken really an appropriate Reaper?  

Am I the only one baffled by this image?
