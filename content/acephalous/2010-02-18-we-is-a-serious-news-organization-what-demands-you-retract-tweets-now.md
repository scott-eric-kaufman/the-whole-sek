## We is a serious news organization what demands you retract tweets now.

The following sentence actually appears in [a post](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/retracto/2010/02/15/retraction-request-roger-ebert/) on the site of a darling of conservative media:
We have identified [yet another tweet](http://twitter.com/ebertchicago/status/8886020414) we would like [Roger Ebert] to retract[.]

The "yet another" is delicious, as it indicates that Andrew Breitbart has initiated a campaign to compel people _to retract their tweets_. The vicious slur of a tweet in question reads:

[![image](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/files/2010/02/ebert-msm-teabaggers1.jpg)](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/files/2010/02/ebert-msm-teabaggers1.jpg)Breitbart's bright bulbs know that's a lie:We have [established](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/pmeister/2010/02/09/teabaggers-roger-ebert-trashes-his-own-fans-and-palin-on-twitter/) [that](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/02/10/regarding-roger-ebert-doubles-down-twitter-trashing-his-teabagging-fans/) [we](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/retracto/2010/02/11/retraction-requests-roger-ebert/) [differ](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/02/11/roger-ebert-trashes-big-hollywood-readers/)
on the last sentence, but his claim he did not know that “teabaggers”
is a pornographic term until the MSM (mainstream media) told him is
provably false. We know it’s false because in 1998, Prof. Ebert [reviewed a film](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980925/REVIEWS/809250302/1023) containing this scene[.]How
can you not respect a corporate non-entity who insists on granting
Ebert a doctorate for the sole purpose using "Prof." as a diminutive?
More to the point: how can you not pity the poor Breitbart intern who,
I hope, is pretending to misunderstand Ebert's patently sarcastic
remark in order to score points with his boss? Because that's what this
all adds up to: some minion being forced to impersonate a
tweet-retracting mountain camel _in order to impress Andrew Breitbart_.
Because this is what impresses Andrew Breitbart: the retraction of
tweets in which people call tea-baggers by the doubly ignorant name
they chose for themselves.\*  

The demand to stop calling
tea-baggers the name they gave themselves is, remarkably, not the
dumbest part of this tweet-retraction crusade: that would be the
faux-outrage Pam Meister musters upon learning that Ebert's tweets
don't rise to the level of "[informed commentary](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/pmeister/2010/02/09/teabaggers-roger-ebert-trashes-his-own-fans-and-palin-on-twitter/)."
She suggests, with a straight face, that the lack of sustained
commentary by Ebert is a grave failure of character, not a feature
inherent in the Twitter's 140 character limit; and she does this, of
course, without acknowledging [the vast archive of his writing](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/archives.html)
freely available online. Granted, Meister might not be any better
acquainted with Google than her fellow tea-baggers, but the point
remains: she thinks Ebert should write tweets with more characters than
Twitter allows, and until he does, she will be very, very cross with
him.  

Which is terrible, terrible news, as the [odds of someone as soft as Ebert](http://www.esquire.com/print-this/roger-ebert-0310) weathering this tweet-retraction campaign are [slim indeed](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/02/roger\_eberts\_last\_words\_cont.html).  

\*They can [pull down their site](http://www.reteaparty.com/2009/02/27/rick-santelli-is-as-mad-as-hell-chicago-tea-party/) in an effort to deny it, but Google remembers that [they were the ones who started using "tea-bag" as a verb](http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:W71X2n6hf\_4J:www.reteaparty.com/2009/02/27/rick-santelli-is-as-mad-as-hell-chicago-tea-party/),
so they need to live with the consequences of their laziness and sexual
stolidity. Liberals didn't claim the Founding Fathers threw tea-bags
into Boston Harbor, nor were they the ones who insisted on compounding
the error of that anachronism by naming their movement without
performing a precautionary Googling. For a movement so concerned with
personal responsibility, you'd think someone in it might take some.

Two points.  First, you cannot expect a real right-wing intern to be equipped to recognize the sarcasm; he will have led a relatively short, relatively irony-deficient life in which the phrase "Didn't know that until the MSM told me" will have always been a serious complaint.  Second, the early appearance of the sign with the slogan "Tea Bag The Liberal Dems Before They Tea Bag You" indicates awareness of defamatory meanings of the term; indeed, defamation of 'Democrat liberals' and the like has often been tied to various gay-panic slurs, so it's really inconceivable that that seminal Teabagger wasn't aware of the specific _Pecker_ meaning.

Ebert gets a pass just cause of it's just so sad what happened to him I think and if he wants to twitter about teaggings and such more power to him. Hang in there Mr. Ebert.

_Ebert gets a pass just cause of it's just so sad what happened to him_  

I'd love to see an actuarial table of what I could get away with on the basis of various injuries and diseases. Lost a pinky? Shoplist a snickers, it's fine. Brain tumor? I get to be Eric Prince! Awesome!

Fun fact: there's no way to take down a tweet. Once it's out there, it's out there for good. Anyone who has ever used the service would know that. So why insist on a course of action that is inherently impossible?

Yeah, you can delete your own tweets. Of course, you can't delete anyone's retweet of your tweets (at least, I'm sure that's true if they retweet by hand; not sure what happens if you delete a tweet that's been retweeted through their retweet button. Also, not liking how my writing sounds when I talk about Twitter.) which is certainly what the cultural carpetbombers would insist as the price for assuaging their outrage.

Breitbart's "empire" is no more adept at fake outrage (see Patterico's latest whinings about O'Keefe and Olberman) than any other whining conservative (see all of them), but he is damn loud about it.  Seeing his red-nosed face screaming at Max Blumenthal was as embarrassing as his fanboys' commentary.

What's next for Andy?  Is he going to demand history retract its indictment of Nixon for being a crook and a tool?  Nature to retract its attack on his waistline?  Happyfeet to retract his earlier spelling error? 

I need to know the last, because surely I am next on his purge list!  After all, when you get down to disabled film critics, your enemies' list is drawing nigh an end.

Mr. Breitbart is a neat guy. I don't always agree with him though but then I don't always agree with Sarah Palin either.  

But that's probably cause she's stupid.
