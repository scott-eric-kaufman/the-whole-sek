## Scholarly Swings and Misses

From James Berger's essay ("Falling Towers and Postmodern Wild Children: Oliver Sacks, Don DeLillo and Turns Against Language") in the latest _PMLA_:
Why did the wild child cross the highway?  To show his imperviousness to every medium of symbolic exchange[!]

He steps to the plate.  Adjusts his crotch.  Sets himself.  Identifies the pitch.  His hips cock, then rotate, as he pulls the bat through the hitting zone.  [He swings clear out of his shoes](http://www.koreus.com/files/200411/sports7.jpg).   He didn't mean to.  But _damn_ is it funny.  

Addendum: I would've written more on this article--and will in the near future--but I only read it because [Holbo](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) wanted to know if I could email it to him.  So I figure it's only polite to let him have the first crack.  But I have the second (on Berger's strange critique of Sacks' _popular_ scientific writing) all lined up.

Scott, I'd read Berger's excellent book \*After the End: Representations of Post-Apocalypse\* before taking shots at his PMLA essay.  I actually heard Berger give the basic argument for it as a talk and thought it quite good, insofar as it identifies a key trope rarely discussed in pomo criticism (i.e., the wild child).  Berger's one of the best lit critics on the subject of pomo longing to escape "language," and he's one of the few tolerable scholars of traumatic narratives.  And I don't think it's a bad thing to criticize so-called "popular science," seeing as what little the American public knows about science it learns from such works.  The sheer popularity of Sacks should open his work up to the need for critique: what cultural longing is his work satisfying?

LB,

I actually liked Berger's article, I just thought those two sentences constituted an unwitting howler.  As for his strange critique of Sacks, I'll write about that later tonight, but my basic complaint (and yes, I even complain about the articles I like) is that he creates a set of standards specific to academic criticism then criticizes Sacks for failing to meet them.  More (and more coherently) later, as I'm off to teach.
