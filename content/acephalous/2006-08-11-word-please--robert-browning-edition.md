			"Reflections on Reading a Life of Dickens"In Dickens, sure, philosophy was lacking,   
Since of calamities he counts the crowning  
That, young, he had too much to do with Blacking.  
Old, he had not enough to do with -------.

No, I'm not springing this on you.  That's how it looks in Yale's _Robert Browning: The Poems, Volume Two_.  I know what the word that goes there means—I've also read a life of Dickens—but can't fathom the which of its friends rhymes with "crowning."

Clowning.  Because clowns cheer you up.

Seriously, could someone who knows about Browning explain how he could write a line with scansion like "Since of calamities he counts the crowning", even in a comic poem?  Is it some kind of reference to alliterative verse, a 19th century Ogden Nash move, or what?

Oh, right.  There's actually another short, bad comic poem with the same blacking / browning joke, \_With A Book\_:

Words shouting, singing, smiling, frowning---  

       Sense lacking.  

Ah, nothing, more obscure than Browning,  

       Save blacking.

        -- Ambrose Bierce

Did Bierce read the original, I wonder, or did he reinvent the same bit?  Whatever the syndrome, it seems to lead to certain derangement of flow, look at that grating comma after "nothing".  Unless the random Web site I got the poem from miscopied it, I suppose.

_how he could write a line with scansion like "Since of calamities he counts the crowning"_

Is it that weird? Just an initial inversion and a feminine ending.

I read the stresses on the first line as "-'-'-'---'-", which is almost regular.  For the second line to be "---'---'-'-" just grates.  The third line can be read as "-'-'-'-'-'-", which makes it even worse.  That combined with the inversion and ending of the second line make it really jump out, somewhat in the same way as your transmission is imagined to jump out of your car's engine when part of it freezes while you're speeding down the highway.

I believe the word you're looking for is "splooging."

Rich, 

You're a very strict scanner, then, on the seco/nd line. Even Milton wouldn't make iambic for you. You'd have to bad all words over two syllables. 

It's just a wierd little poem. You're being uncharitable.

Don't know if I'm being helpful or stating the obvious -- the joke may be on me -- but isn't the implied word "Browning"?

That's what I assumed, Luther; see comments re: Bierce above.  But maybe there is some second meaning that Scott is alluding to.

Sorry, I wasn't being performatively dense enough up there.  No, the joke's not on you, L.B., I was just trying to point to the, um, "very different" connotations that particular rhyme would have now.  Granted, this may be because all my friends are gay (and one of them was on the couch when I first read this and responded, well, _frankly_), but I thought the whole thing'd be funny if it was all left to intimation. (That said, I initially didn't "get it" and had to have him explain it to me, so there you go, more evidence of my idiocy.)

pwning.

I seem to remember a lame pun on Browning and tanning in (um) "Encyclopedia Brown".

Rich and CR, to separate degrees, I think you are right and wrong about lines 2 and 3.  First off, Milton is not necessarily as iambic as you propose; iambic pentameter, for some metricians and historians of the field, is only belatedly, and sometimes violently, applied to writers like Shakespeare and Milton.  It is quite liberating to reread them without the chickenwire of iambic pentameter forcing your accentuation.  A suggested scansion for Browning's poem here:

1: -x-x-x-x-x-  

2: x--x-x-x-x-  

3: xx--x--x-x-  

4: x--x-x-x-x-

This reading favors the limerick-like quality of the verse, and owes something to Hopkins' arguments for a set number of stresses per line but with varying intervals between them.  Of course Browning is not as liberal Hopkins, since there are still eleven positions in each line here (making exclusively iambic meter impossible) instead of a fixed set of stresses and variable non-stressed syllables.

I agree on not forcing iambic -- basically, I was ignoring CR, since I don't think that he knows what he's talking about, or he wouldn't be comparing the metrical variation that sounds fine in a fragment of a long poem to that in a four line poem -- but I don't see how you can read the second line with those stresses.  The stress on "Since", maybe, but a stress on the "ties" of "calamities"?  Unless they pronounced words quite differently in 19th century England than they do now, I don't hear it.

Rich, the stress on "-ties" of "calamities" would have to be a soft stress, and sadly I am not blogologically savvy enough to know how to input a notational system of stress regulation that would show it, although perhaps for this purpose line 2 could be:

x--X-x-X-X-

or so.

_The stress on "Since", maybe, but a stress on the "ties" of "calamities"?_

Um, Rich. If we go by the Puchalsky method, iambic anymeter would be impossible in English, unless, in a Perecian game, we basically used nothing but words of two syllables or less. One stress is harder than the other in "calamities," like almost any non-compound word of more than 3 syllables en anglais, yes, but it still, in a generally iambic poem, scans O-X-O-X. (If you need it to scan elseways, due to another form in place, it can do that too. Stress isn't absolute - it's situational...) 

This is very basic stuff. If you can't get it, you can't scan. That's the long and the short (or stressed and unstressed) of it. 

Poetaster's scanning of the poem is right. 

But, well, Milton is pretty regular in PL, considering the damn poem is about five million lines long. Of course there are inversions, all over the place, nearly every line. You can't write supple (if, in this case, "muscular") verse without it - it'd sound ridiculuous....  

But count the number of lines of more than 10 syllables. There are only a handful in the entire poem (I'll wait here while you do... tick tock tick tock) and they are done for emphasis, intentionally. If you've got a good ear, they kind of go off like landmines when you hit them. 

Boooom! 11 syllables. Wish I could come up with an example on the fly, but it was a long time ago, for me and Milton.

Poetaster, yes there can be soft stresses there in theory, but since I'm talking about how the line sounds, I don't think that one hears them.  The combination of the stress on the middle syllable of the phrase "Since of calamities he" being so much greater than anywhere else, plus the repeated vowel in the last two syllables, appears to almost force the last two syllables to have the same weight.  The "Since" would be an easier stress if there wasn't a comma at the end of the preceeding line.

CR, you're just flaming.
