**Oglethorpe:** (_dancing_) Now where are the many hot women with whom we will be dancing in the celebration of the Moonidiot exploding?

**Err:** With violence!

**Err:** The Earth too!  The Earth too!   You heard the man!

**Ignignokt:** Our Moon violence is light years beyond your primitive Earth violence.

**Err:** Psychological warfare, bitches!
