[G.D.](http://postbourgie.com/) pointed out the latest Gladwell [article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/19/091019fa\_fact\_gladwell?currentPage=all)
to me, and now that I’ve read it, I’m at a loss for words: rarely in
the history of long-form journalism has the pitch been more obvious or
the product more strained. Gladwell decided to write an article on
violence in the National Football Leauge, went to his editor with his
Vick-topical article and was told to run with it. The problem, of
course, is that the entire article boils down to this question:

Is [football] dogfighting or is it stock-car racing?

And that question, I think we can agree, makes little sense for the
simple reason that its analogy isn’t analogous. I know that blunt
counterintuitive statements are a hallmark of literary journalism, but
they need to be founded on something more substantial than this:

[I]s the kind of [tau deposit-induced dementia] being
uncovered by McKee and Omalu [in former NFL players] incidental to the
game of football or inherent in it? Part of what makes dogfighting so
repulsive is the understanding that violence and injury cannot be
removed from the sport. It’s a feature of the sport that dogs almost
always get hurt. Something like stock-car racing, by contrast, is
dangerous, but not unavoidably so.

The relevant analogy is right there—preventable injuries in Nascar
versus the NFL—but had Gladwell went with that, he would have to ditch
the dogfighting angle.\* The problem, then, is that the once venerable _New Yorker_
would rather be clever and topical than deeply informative. Consider,
for example, the career of the go-to literary journalist for me and Ari,
John McPhee. His first book was about [_A Sense of Where You Are_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374526893/diesekoschmar-20), was about the professional basketball player, long-tenured Senator and former Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, but _was written before Bradley graduated from Princeton_. McPhee did a superlative job outlining what would make Bradley successful, but he didn’t write about him because the _New Yorker_ wanted an article about the Senatorial or Presidential candidate.

Similarly, after Katrina the magazine saw fit to print McPhee’s
brilliant (and to my students, hilariously unpronounceable) essay “[Atchafalaya](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987\_02\_23\_039\_TNY\_CARDS\_000347146?currentPage=all),” which _was first published in in 1987_,
long before most people outside of Louisiana cared about the state of
the levees. My point, as you probably guessed, is that the odds of the _New Yorker_
dipping into their archives and pulling out a Gladwell essay on the
strength of its reporting or the depth of its intelligence decrease
with every superficially clever, patently topical article they allow
him to write and consent to publish. This isn’t to say that Gladwell is
incapable of strong reportage or intellectual depth—only that that
people can’t seem to convince him to slow down and write something with
heft enough to be as relevant twenty years down the line as it is this
week.

\*I have nothing against clever analogies when they actually, you know, work. My friend Barry Siegel [combined a thrilling narrative of a crashing B29 and a legal case that led to](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/files/siegel\_barry\_the\_secret\_of\_the\_b29.doc) . . . something else both topical and relevant which I won’t spoil.

Your last link gives me a 404 error, but the following ought to bring up the episode you're referring to.  Note: the description on that page already constitutes a spoiler for the Siegel article (but if you wanted to avoid spoilers, you wouldn't be following a link introduced with the words "If you want spoilers...")

I read this article too, and must confess that although it had some useful information, was not a good analogy as you point out.  It made it a little unpleasant for me to read also, even though I'm predisposed to be interested in either football or the circumstances surrounding the illegal dogfighting ring that Vick was involved, no matter how tangentially, with...

But, perhaps I played too much football back in school, or maybe all of those carrier landings...

Using the NASCAR analogy as the core fails to capture a major element.

In NASCAR, the goals of the driver include managing risk, avoiding damage, and avoiding accidents. The better the driver, the lower the risk. The entire goal of the team is to get a car across the finish line as fast as possible, and safer cars help. Safety equipment may slow the cars, but in a well-regulated environment, nobody has to cut corners for fear that another team has thrown out their fire extinguishers.

In the NFL, the goal of many members of the team is to seek out collisions. The better the player, the harder he hits, the more damage he causes, the higher his salary. Safety impedes the game.

Gladwell says that NASCAR ain't relevant because unlike the other two activities, injuries are preventable in NASCAR.  his analogy has to do with moral status; we love them (fighting dogs, football players) for what they do, and it is not incidental but essential that what they do damages them irreparably.  it's actually not a very Gladwellian piece, in that "cleverness", whether one sees that as positive or negative, is not its primary quality.  rather, I think, it's trying to appall.
