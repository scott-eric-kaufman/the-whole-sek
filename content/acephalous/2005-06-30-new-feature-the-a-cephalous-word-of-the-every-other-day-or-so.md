## New Feature: The A. Cephalous Word of the Every Other Day or So

Frustrated by other "word of the day" services?  Tired of receiving daily emails from that most august of all dictionaries, the [OED](http://www.oed.com), in which you learn that "place" n. means "Space.  Extension in two (or three) directions; room"?  

Have I got a deal for you!  Starting now I'll be posting whatever obscure word threatens my colloquial speech with regular usage on any given day.  With definitions, quotations, citations and all the other requisite lexicological dressings.    

The A. Cephalous Word of the Every Other Day or So for Thursday, June 30, 2005 comes from heraldry: 

_**appaumy,** adj._

(əpaʊmI)

(of a hand) with the palm toward the viewer.

**1991** Suburban White Girl 15 Minutes After Watching _In Living Color_ (to A. Cephalous), _On The Telephone_ "If she pulls that shit with me again, that's it, she'll wish the worst thing I did to her with my hands is flash dexter appaumy."  **1992** Suburban White Girl (to A. Cephalous), _P.E. Class_ "Oh no, you did na, you DID NA! Beseech the sinister hand appaumy bitch!" **1998** Suburban White Girl, Early Wedded, Early Bedded, _Divorce Proceedings_ "Your Honor, then I told him to supplicate before my hand appaumy if he wanted to save this marriage, and he said 'Whatever Janine!  _What.  Ever._ I've been fucking your sister for _five years_.'" **2005** Suburban White Girl, Divorced (to A. Cephalous' best friend), _Tenth High School Reunion_ "A. Cephalous couldn't even bother to show up for his own high school reunion.  What a fucktard.  Next time I see him it'll be all hands appaumy, dexter, sinister, and all that shit."

But I'm _deaf_, Ray, so all my pronunciations would be deaf-speak approximations which would, if repeated, call the calumny of the Militant Deaf Defense League (the dreaded MiDDLe) down upon you.  And _no one_ survives MiDDL's slanderous attacks with reputation intact.  I'm doing you a favor, Ray, a favor...

How did I ever go through life without knowing this word or reading this post?

HILARIOUS.
