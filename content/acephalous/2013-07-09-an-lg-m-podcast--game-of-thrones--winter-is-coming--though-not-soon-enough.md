[![winter is coming](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/winter-is-coming.png "winter is coming")](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/)

[Steven Attewell](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/) and I decided that we didn't want to wait until next February to continue talking about _Game of Thrones_, and so we decided to start over. Here's our take on "Winter Is Coming," the serie's inaugural episode. I'm including links to the works I referenced and will have Steven do the same.
