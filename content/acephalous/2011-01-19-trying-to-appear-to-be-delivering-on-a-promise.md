## Trying to appear to be delivering on a promise

Over at [_National Review_](http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/257475/out-roots-robert-costa-andrew-stiles) I learn that Eric Cantor insists that Republicans will do "everything  [they] can to delay and defund" health care reform because they are  "about trying to deliver on our commitment, to make sure that the  Obamacare bill does not take full hold and effect."  Why doesn't he want  it to take full effect?  Because he knows that entitlement programs  tend to be wildly popular.  The logic is simple: if what Michele  Bachmann calls "the crown jewel of socialism" succeeds, many of those  previously uninsured voters will never vote Republican again.

We know this.

They know this.

The base that Obama created in 2008 is far larger than the one the  Republicans used to win the House in 2010 and they know that the 2012  demographics will look more like 2008 than 2010.  The Republican's only  option is to prevent Obama's base from further expanding, and the most  effective way to do that is to delay the implementation of health care  reform.

Except they can't do that.  The Senate will shoot them down.  The  President will veto them.  So what can they do?  They can spend the next  two years "trying to deliver on [their] commitment," because as John  Boehner [said](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/257532/boehner-lets-challenge-ourselves-do-better-andrew-stiles), "repeal means keeping a promise."

Except it doesn't.  What repeal actually means is _creating and sustaining the appearance of trying to keep a promise_.  Failure to do so will shrink their newly established base and leave  them as vulnerable in 2012 as they proved to be in 2008.  Expect to see  quite a bit of appearing to be trying to deliver on an undeliverable  promise in the next few years.

Well, sure, I think even they know that the repeal vote was theatre, a symbolic gesture meant to placate their base. But, it seems you ignore their ability to delay and hinder implementation through other means - Republicans are, after all, masters of obstruction. They can simply refuse to allocate the money necessary to implement the program, allowing them to turn around and talk about what a failure HCR is.

_many of those previously uninsured voters will never vote Republican again._

Like fuck.  25 years from now, they'll be picketing Democratic candidates with the same "keep government hands off Medicare" signs.

What Doctor Memory said. Medicare and Social Security recipients are some of the most reliably Republican voters out there.

I lost track--who's cynically trying to grab voters?  The Republicans attempting to capitalize on their ineffectual obstructionist theatrics, or the Democrats trying to use my tax dollars to bribe the (formerly) uninsured?

KWK: Well, bribe or not (it's not), the Democrats are actually delivering life-saving reform, rather than pure rhetoric that has no practical benefit to anyone. So you tell me which is more cynical.

Regarding your tax dollars: you know, when I wrote the IRS complaining about my tax dollars being spent on wars and illegal renditions that I abhor, they were pretty prompt about sending it back to me. Let me know if you'd like a template for the e-mail I sent.

I appreciate that, as a foreigner, I don't quite get the intricacies and subtleties of US thinking on this matter.  But if I were Obama I'd try to repeat the phrase 'Obamacare will save American lives' as many times a day as possible.

@Adam: You're not wrong, but for some reason, death notwithstanding, that doesn't stick.  It's like everything you think of us is true ...

I don't think it's fair to say it doesn't stick, when it's hardly been tried by this administration. Some of the confusion and ignorance about the law is inevitable, but some of it has to be blamed on the Obama team, which has just done a miserable promotional job.

I think Republican obstructionism at the state level will be the most successful means by which they fulfill Limbaugh's desire for Obama to fail.
