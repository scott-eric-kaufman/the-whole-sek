Stop what you're doing _right now_ and click on [this link](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/07/asterios\_polyp.html#photo=1).  I can wait.  

Back?  Good.  

Now go [buy it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307377326/diesekoschmar-20).  

I'll have a comprehensive review of it completed whenever I locate my scanner, because explaining how the book works requires you see the interplay between David Mazzucchelli's words and hyper-stylized artwork.  (I know this is always the case, but you clicked on that link, didn't you?  So you can see that it's even more the case here.)

For those unfamiliar with Mazzucchelli, he illustrated Paul Auster's _City of Glass_ [.[pdf](http://www.mediafire.com/?jzz2johurnr)] as well as Frank Miller's _Batman: Year One_.  High quality material, that is, but nothing that hinted he was capable of something like _Asterios Polyp_.

This book is starting to haunt me in that good sort of way. My old writing professor (do I start calling him mentor when we still talk and meet after I graduate?) sent me an e-mail telling me to check it out after he read a review, then it got mentioned on...The Millions? I think? Now here. And the City of Glass connection, which is a work I love (both the original and the graphic adaptation) and may be guest lecturing on.

This is clearly fate. I'm ordering it from my comic book shop today.

Interesting. The family background stuff seems a bit off, to me, but families vary. The narrative structure feels stiff, like a literal translation: in this case, a literal translation of a conventional storytelling style (kind of a _New Yorker_ short story style? I don't read much of that.) onto the page. It might work, though.
