...I suggest we add "[conservatives rapping](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/10/cpac-2012-rap\_n\_1268571.html)":






After all, there's nothing wrong with a "knicker" joke among a room of wealthy white Republicans and that one black guy.

**UPDATE:** [Also](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/01/more-from-the-young-cons).

**UPDATE II:** For the sake of comparison, here's your modern conservative movement in two images. First, immediately before (1:49) the "knicker" joke:

[![cpac01](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cpac01.jpg "cpac01")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cpac01.jpg)

Second, here's immediately after (1:57) the "knicker" joke:

[![cpac02](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cpac02.jpg "cpac02")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cpac02.jpg)

That's where this "rapper" is asking that one black guy "What? I can't say 'knickers'?" I'd be indignant too, I suppose, if I wasn't allowed to proudly be the provocative asshole I am.

I love that the dude who immediately ditched clearly is working and still decided he wasn't going to suffer through that crap.
