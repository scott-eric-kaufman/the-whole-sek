Now that I've shoved half of Knapp and no Wittgenstein from my plate, I have time to ask the following mundane question:

If necessity demanded you could only do three things in San Francisco and Napa Valley, what would they be?Â

Do those grad students you mentioned count as one or two?

Um, you should know better than most that S.F. and Napa Valley are places not people...you know, being that you live there and stuff.

No, I think they /are/ people. San Francisco is a filthy, bearded, unwashed hippie (much like you or Thoreau), while Napa Valley is a wine snob. Now, wine snobs should by definition be punched right in the face, while hippies should be punched in the nuts (or in some unfortunate cases, in the nut), but since the combined population of San Francisco and Napa is in the neighborhood of a million people, your punching hand will get pretty gosh-darn sore before you're done.

So if I had to choose three things to do, they would, on sober reflection, be:   

1) Get a magical ice bag that refilled itself when the ice cubes started melting  

2) Go on a wonderful tour sure to bring many happy memories and a reddened, swollen fist.  

3) Ew! Not THAT kind of reddened, swollen... EW! What's WRONG with you?!
