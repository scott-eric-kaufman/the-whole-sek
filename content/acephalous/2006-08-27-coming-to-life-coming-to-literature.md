## Coming to Life, Coming to Literature

Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard's _[Coming to Life](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0967007674/diesekoschmar-20)_ introduces the lay reader to the subject of developmental biology with all the skill one expects of gifted science writer.  (The [review](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2006/08/book\_review\_coming\_to\_life\_by.php) at [Retrospectacle](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/) covers all the bases.)  Yet, despite its clarity, something about it unsettled me from the very first sentence:
The question of how an animal develops has preoccupied humans since Antiquity. (1)

I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something about that sentence seemed ... wrong.  Fascinated by the material, I pressed on and encountered:
In 1827, German-Estonian biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876) described the first human egg cell that was derived from a young woman who had drowned after a wild night. (11)

Maybe it's because I'm a literary studies guy, but I had a visceral reaction to the word "derived" in that sentence.  One does not "derive" an egg cell from "a young woman who had drowned after a wild night."  However, I realized that the coldness of that sentence wouldn't be mitigated by the first alternative which sprung to mind: "harvest."  That sounded equally inhumane.  

What struck me about that sentence was the manner in which it tossed the dead body deep into subordination:
In 1827, German-Estonian biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (_subject_) described (_verb_) the first human egg cell (_direct object_) that (_new clause!_) was derived (_passive!_) from (_first prepositional phrase!_) a young woman (_anonymous!_) who had drowned (_adjectival clause!_) after (_second preprositional phrase!_) a wild night (_cliché!_).

As I poured over this sentence in a frantic attempt to discover the source of my unease, I had an epiphany.  I flipped back and scoured the cover, the title page, the first two pages of acknowledgments ... nothing.  Finally, on the verge of surrendering, I decided to read the fine print.  

Wouldn't you know it?  There, in tiny print, just above the Library of Congress information, I found my grail:
Helga Schier, Ph.D., Translator from the original German

I suppose this must represent the emphasis of the sciences on the content of the work, but I still find the lack of announcement off-putting.  I am far more forgiving of a translated work than I am of an abundantly awkward one.  Until I'd reached page 90 of _Coming to Life_, I was regularly upset by the awkwardness of the prose; the second I realized it was a translation, my enjoyment increased ten-fold.  I'd freed my mind to address the ideas and ignore the stilted prose.  If only I could've done so sooner ...
