If I composed a list of the names of people I respect and then placed odds on particular couplings appearing on-stage together, this one would've been around 10,000,000,000 to 1... nevertheless, I've learned that [Jeff Tweedy](http://wilcoworld.net) and [Lawrence Lessig](http://lessig.org) will [appear](http://www.nypl.org/research/calendar/eventdesc.cfm?id=1166) together at the New York Public Library on April 7.  I can't wait to hear Larry's rendition of "Company in My Back."  I'm also pretty damn  sure Tweedy's rendition of [_Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity_](http://www.jus.uio.no/sisu/freeculture.lawrence.lessig/doc.txt) will rock the socks right off the feet of some unwitting library patrons.
