. . . to the person who claims the Pang Brother's 2006 film _Re-Cycle_ is "THE most EMO movie EVER" as if that were a good thing. The film, though, is THE most SOMETHING movie EVER, but I'm not sure what. The list could include:

*   THE most BIZARRE film about the unintended consequences of writer's block EVER
*   THE most IMPRESSIVE film by twin brothers who, according to [_Wikipedia_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang\_brothers#Personal\_lives), "are in a relationship and rumored to be engaged" EVER
*   THE most LIKELY FIRST film to equate throwing away a sheet of paper with aborting a fetus EVER
*   THE most UNNECESSARILY SUBTITLED film EVER
*   THE most OSTENSIBLY APOLITICAL Asian horror film to [take its cues](http://www.antiabortionsigns.com/signsinaction.html) from the American conservative movement EVER

As I said: THE most SOMETHING movie EVER. I'll start with the minor complaints and work my way forward:

**THE most IMPRESSIVE film by twin brothers who, according to [_Wikipedia_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang\_brothers#Personal\_lives), "are in a relationship and rumored to be engaged" EVER**

Either those two are a little _too_ close, or _Wikipedia_ entries sometimes need editing.

**THE most UNNECESSARILY SUBTITLED film EVER**

Unless you're being intentionally thick, as Scott McCloud is in the (center) panel from _DESTROY!!!_ below, there is absolutely no reason for subtitles to be [duo-specific](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html):

[![Duo-specific](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5195497970b-500pi "Duo-specific")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5195497970b-pi)

If I can see that the aborted fetus of the protagonist, Tsui Ting-Yin, is screaming and hear its banshee-keening, there is no need to have a subtitle inform me that [_TSUI TING-YIN'S ABORTED FETUS IS TELLING ITS WOULD-HAVE-BEEN MOTHER HOW IT FEELS ABOUT BEING ABORTED VIA A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK THAT WILL LIKELY CAUSE TINNITUS_]. To prove this point, I will continue reviewing the movie in the manner of its subtitles.

The aborted fetus thing may not be a conservative thing at all: there's a tradition in some Asian Buddhisms (Japanese, for sure, and I think it exists in Taiwan as well) of concern about the results of [miscarriages and children's deaths becoming "hungry ghost" or otherwise malevolent spirits](http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/6941.php). In Japan, the [Jizo Boddhisatva](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=98457282%!N(MISSING)00&q=jizo&m=text) is particularly associated with salvation for these souls. 

Though somewhat eerie -- [Japanese ghost stories](http://books.google.com/books?id=0L4OAAAAIAAJ&dq=lafcadio+hearn+kwaidan&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=\_zGTSprSIYvssQO\_9-TTDw&sa=X&oi=book\_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false) are justifiably appreciated by afficianados of the creepy -- the idea of vengeful fetuses and the equation of mental creations with fetuses actually makes a lot more sense to me in that context.
