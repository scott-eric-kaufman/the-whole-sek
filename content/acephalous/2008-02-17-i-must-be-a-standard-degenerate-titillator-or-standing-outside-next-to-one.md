## I Must Be a Standard Degenerate Titillator (or Standing Outside Next to One)

A reader forwards [a post](http://pandagon.blogsome.com/2008/02/17/sunday-freethinkertv-obsession-blogging/) from _[Pandagon](http://pandagon.blogsome.com/)_ which includes the following sentence:
The show [_Deadwood_] caught a lot of praise and flack for the amount of cursing on
it, but I haven’t seen much in the way of in-depth criticism about how
the rampant cursing works, just some standard titillation.

To which I am obliged to aver: "_[Ahem](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/deadwood\_and\_to.html)_.   _[Ahem](http://waxbanks.typepad.com/blog/2006/06/the\_language\_of.html)_.  _[Ahem](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/open\_university/archive/2006/08/31/61797.aspx)_."  

Cocksuckers need not even resort to Google Blogsearch—[plain Google](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&hs=hEG&q=deadwood+dialogue&btnG=Search) pulls the fuckers right on up.  Ask me?  Backwoods big-shot bloggers can't take advice when it's [_free fucking gratis_](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008\_02/013146.php).

So what does "suck eggs" mean in Mark Twain?

From The Virginian, supposedly the first cowboy novel:

“I suppose you have me beat,” said Steve, grinning at him affectionately. “You’re such a son-of-a-- when you get down to work. Well, so long! I got to fix my horse’s hoofs.” 

I had expected that the man would be struck down. He had used to the Virginian a term of heaviest insult, I thought. I had marvelled to hear it come so unheralded from Steve’s friendly lips. And now I marvelled still more. Evidently he had meant no harm by it, and evidently no offence had been taken. Used thus, this language was plainly complimentary. I had stepped into a world new to me indeed, and novelties were occurring with scarce any time to get breath between them.

(sigh) I love Deadwood.  I'm seeing Ian McShane give a talk next week.  He can step on my neck anyday.
