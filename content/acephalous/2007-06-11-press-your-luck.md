## <em>Press Your Luck</em>

_Scott, exhausted, opens Outlook and prepares to check his email for the first time today.  He would prefer not to check it ever again, but must send off an article before the end of business hours.  The tension shows on his face.  Not about the article, but about what might await him in his inbox._
**Scott:** BIG MONEY NO WHAMMIES BIG MONEY NO WHAMMIES BIG MONEY NO WHAMMIES!  

_The deluge begins.  Al3X recommends he tries C1Ala5.  H-Net Something-or-Other requests something or other._

**Scott:** BIG MONEY NO WHAMMIES BIG MONEY NO WHA—

_An email with an unfamiliar name is not shuffled to a sub-folder.  He closes his eyes.****_

**Scott:** (_softly_) 
no whammies ... no whammies ... no whammies ...

_He opens one eye and slowly reads the first line.  It is the first of many, many letters of support.  He considers himself lucky, and is momentarily relieved._

**Scott:** C'mon now!  NO WHAMMIES NO WHAMMIES NO WHAMMIES NO WAIT WHAT?

_Another email with a strange subject line from an unknown sender.  He baits his breath so fast he draws blood.  However, as he does not need his carpets cleaned this month, his eyes continue down the screen._

**Scott:** BIG MONEY NOW, BIG MONEY NOW, NO WHAMMIES BIG MONEY NO WHAMMIES!

_One hundred emails pass.  Then two.  Then three.  Scott's face becomes the very portrait of the man subscribed to too many listservs.  Four hundred emails have arrived and been ushered into the appropriate sub-folder, destined to be read as soon as Scott finishes that pile of New Yorkers from 2003.  Her attention drawn by all his yelling, The Little Womedievalist enters the room and addresses Scott._

**Scott:** (_winded_)  big ... big ... money ... no ... no ... whammies.

**LW:** What are you doing?

**Scott:** Ch-ch-check-ing m-m-mail.

**LW:** And?

**Scott:** No whammies.

**LW:** No what?

**Scott:** Whammies, I say, no whammies.  Praise Jesus, no whammies.

No, not making light of anything.  Those were the words rolling through my head as I checked my email, absurd as it may seem.  Or _is_.  Absurd as all this _is_.

See, I cleverly avoided contributing to the problem by not sending you an Email of support, figuring the comment box would be good enough.

If you keep reading your Email that way, though -- well, maybe you shouldn't delete that carpet cleaning Email quite yet.

If you had, I wouldn't have read it until tonight.  A useful exercise, actually, not checking my email until the evening.  Of course, now I have a few hundred emails to respond to _en masse_, but it's only slightly more exhausting to do it in one go than as they trickle in.

Hey Scott, I came to this whole thing really late, and since I am not a Jesus' General reader (seriously, doesn't the same old schtick get old after, you know, 2 or 3 years?), it took me a while to catch up. I just wanted to say, then, I hope this all blows over and no harm comes to you, even in the form of further harassment by someone accusing you of being a racist while ironically (maybe?) calling him/herself the ghost of a racist. The internet is a strange world, sometimes. Anyway, offers of support are better late than never, I hope.

I wonder, how does Jesus' General come out of this whole thing? Like I said, I don't read him, but from the links I've seen on other blogs, I get the impression that just about everyone else in the liberal blogosphere does. Does that change now that he's shown himself to be a first class, megalomaniacal asshole (with a slightly-more-than-slight persecution complex and a deficit of honesty)?

I like the way you go all David Bowie in the middle of this:

"Scott: Ch-ch-check-ing m-m-mail"

I'm glad to hear about the deluge of support. This whole incident really was shite.

Chris, I don't know that the General will lose much readership out of this. I think he did some weird, stupid and panicky things, but then... people sometimes do weird, stupid and panicky things mid-flamewar. This doesn't necessarily make them bad people, and his regular readership will in any case be disposed to give him the benefit of the doubt.

If this kind of thing becomes a regular pattern or he fails to learn from it, that's different.

I liked that show.  I always watch for at least a few minutes if I see it on whatever channel shows early '90s game show reruns.

I was just about to send you an email of support, actually (having also come late to this whole thing), but now I'll pass since it sounds like you've got enough to read to last you the rest of the month.  But if you're into the whole meeting-blog-people-in-real-life thing, I'll buy you a beer sometime at the Irvine location of your choice.  

Good luck with this whole mess; I hope there are no lasting consequences on your end.

Scott, 

Here's hoping that your stalker does not go as "off the rails" as Goldstein's did. From what I've seen here and there, the two stalkers have a LOT of similarities, including their politics. 

Which is sad, really.
