**[Letter I.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0005)**

By your permission I lay before you, in a series of letters, the results of my researches upon beauty and art. I am keenly sensible of the importance as well as of the charm and dignity of this undertaking. I shall treat a subject which is closely connected with the better portion of our happiness and not far removed from the moral nobility of human nature. I shall plead this cause of the beautiful before a heart by which her whole power is felt and exercised ...

**[Letter II.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0006)**

But I might perhaps make a better use of the opening you afford me if I were to direct your mind to a loftier theme than that of art ... I hope that I shall succeed in convincing you that this matter of art is less foreign to the needs than to the tastes of our age; nay, that, to arrive at a solution even in the political problem, the road of aesthetics must be pursued, because it is through beauty that we arrive at freedom. But I cannot carry out this proof without my bringing to your remembrance the principles by which the reason is guided in political legislation.

**[Letter V.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0009)**

Does the present age, do passing events, present this character? I direct my attention at once to the most prominent object in this vast structure ...

**[Letter VI.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0010)**

Have I gone too far in this portraiture of our times? I do not anticipate this stricture, but rather another—that I have proved too much by it ...

**[Letter VII.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0011)**

Can this effect of harmony be attained by the state? That is not possible, for the state, as at present constituted, has given occasion to evil, and the state as conceived in the idea, instead of being able to establish this more perfect humanity, ought to be based upon it. Thus the researches in which I have indulged would have brought me back to the same point from which they had called me off for a time ...

**[Letter VIII.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0012)**

Must philosophy therefore retire from this field, disappointed in its hopes? Whilst in all other directions the dominion of forms is extended, must this the most precious of all gifts be abandoned to a formless chance? Must the contest of blind forces last eternally in the political world, and is social law never to triumph over a hating egotism?

**[Letter IX.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0013)**

But perhaps there is a vicious circle in our previous reasoning! Theoretical culture must it seems bring along with it practical culture, and yet the latter must be the condition of the former ...

**[Letter X.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0014)**

Convinced by my preceding letters, you agree with me on this point, that man can depart from his destination by two opposite roads, that our epoch is actually moving on these two false roads, and that it has become the prey, in one case, of coarseness, and elsewhere of exhaustion and depravity. It is the beautiful that must bring it back from this twofold departure. But how can the cultivation of the fine arts remedy, at the same time, these opposite defects, and unite in itself two contradictory qualities? Can it bind nature in the savage, and set it free in the barbarian? Can it at once tighten a spring and loose it; and if it cannot produce this double effect, how will it be reasonable to expect from it so important a result as the education of man?

**[Letter XV.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0019)**

I approach continually nearer to the end to which I lead you, by a path offering few attractions. Be pleased to follow me a few steps further, and a large horizon will open up to you, and a delightful prospect will reward you for the labor of the way ...

**[Letter XVI.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0020)**

I think I have now answered and also cleared up the contradiction commonly met in the judgments of men respecting the influence of the beautiful, and the appreciation of aesthetic culture ... Consequently in the sequel of my researches I shall adopt the course that nature herself follows with man considered from the point of view of aesthetics, and setting out from the two kinds of beauty, I shall rise to the idea of the genus. I shall examine the effects produced on man by the gentle and graceful beauty when its springs of action are in full play, and also those produced by energetic beauty when they are relaxed. I shall do this to confound these two sorts of beauty in the unity of the beau-ideal, in the same way that the two opposite forms and modes of being of humanity are absorbed in the unity of the ideal man.

**[Letter XIX.](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

Judy dumped me today.  Stupid bitch.  Said I couldn't tell my _Bestimmbarkeit_ from my _Bestimmung_.  I'll show her.  One day I'll be famous.

**[Letter XXI.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0025)**

I have remarked in the beginning of the foregoing letter that there is a twofold condition of determinableness and a twofold condition of determination. And now I can clear up this proposition ...

**[Letter XXIII.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0027)**

I take up the thread of my researches, which I broke off only to apply the principles I laid down to practical art and the appreciation of its works ...

**[Letter XXVII.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6798/6798-h/6798-h.htm#2H\_4\_0031)**

Do not fear for reality and truth. Even if the elevated idea of aesthetic appearance become general, it would not become so, as long as man remains so little cultivated as to abuse it; and if it became general, this would result from a culture that would prevent all abuse of it. Everyone in that culture—even, perhaps especially, the Jews—would then eat bacon.  I love bacon ...

No one enjoys overlong jokes about obscure C19th German aestheticians.  

Except, possibly me.

Very funny...  Tired of close readings?  Or wanting to test whether your readers are reading closely?

_Martin_ Amis?  I'm moving up in the word.

N.P., I'm just giving readers a breather, making sure I don't bore them out their routine.

I'm in agreement with Mortimer Amis. This is funny stuff, Scott; Dave Barry did something similar when he wrote his own version of the Declaration of Independence: "When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind require that they should get some sleep. Because I have been up for two nights now, declaring independence, and I may be a lanky Virginian but I am not a machine, for heaven's sake, and it just doesn't make sense to sit here scrawling away these complex-compound sentences when I just know nobody's going to read them, because nobody ever does read all the way through these legal documents. Take leases. You take the average tenants..."
