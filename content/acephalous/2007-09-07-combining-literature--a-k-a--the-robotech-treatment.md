## Combining Literature, <em>a.k.a.</em> The <em>Robotech</em> Treatment

Surprisingly, I loved _Robotech_ as a child.  I say "surprisingly" because, by and large, I never had a clue what was going on.  The events in one episode would take place in space and the good guys would look like [this](http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=4)[](http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=4) while the bad guys like [this](http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=34). The next episode would feature a completely different cast, be on a planet, and pit [these](http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=61) folks against [these](http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=26).  Then another cast would arrive _at_ a planet _from_ space in one of [these](http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=55) and all I could do was repeat to myself, mantra-like: "They all want the Protoculture ... They all want the Protoculture ... They all want the Protoculture."  (It goes without saying that I had no idea what "Protoculture" was nor why anyone would want it.)

Turns out, I had [every reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech#The\_original\_television\_series\_.281985.29) to be confused:
_Robotech_ is a story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of **three different [mecha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha) anime series**: _[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Super\_Dimension\_Fortress\_Macross)_, _[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_Dimension\_Cavalry\_Southern\_Cross)_, and _[Genesis Climber Mospeada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis\_Climber\_Mospeada)_.

It never occurred to me that the best way to fill up a syndication schedule would be to splice three completely unrelated stories into a single, nonsensical narrative.  Of course, creating nonsense is simple: first-generation _Care Bears_ could evolve in _My Little Pony_ (or vice versa) and frolic until the the arrival of the evil [_Popples_](http://www.popples.org/), &c.   

I wonder whether we can't do the same for literature, only in a sensible fashion?  Who wouldn't want to read, say, _The House of Sister Carrie **Bradshaw**_, the moving novel about a woman who almost has it all, is reduced to nothing, and (_scratch death scene, insert amnesia-inducing bonnet-frilling accident_) moves to the country, only to return to the city, rise from nothing, become an actress, and (_add in some literary aspirations and play up the fact that as "Lily," "Carrie" was quite knowledgeable about contemporary fashion_) becomes a noted advice columnist no more able to run her own life now than "Lily" had been before her accident.

I'm sure you can muster better.

Ah, _Robotech_.  Did you know that Minmay's song is actually bearable in the Japanese-language version?  

But somehow, even as a youth (or however old I was, cough), I could tell that this was a pastiche, and it became for me the ur-Postmodern text.  Later on, reading _Gravity's Rainbow_, I'd be thinking "Wait, this isn't trashy enough.  Where is the moronic pop culture?  The incoherence?  The mixed-up genres?"

Which may be one of the reasons why I think that [Hitherby Dragons](http://imago.hitherby.com/) is, seriously, a work of postmodern genius.  There, in [Rainbow Noir](http://imago.hitherby.com/archives/000093.php),  "the padlock of alienation, the lipstick of transgression, the hourglass of fatalism, and the broken heart of the femme fatale" spring from the magical symbols of bears, but Nihilism Bear is not defeated, and [My Little Wolves](http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=553) eat each other when they are hurt.  Seriously, I have no idea why this hasn't been hailed as a masterpiece and Rebecca convinced to finish it somehow.  Aren't you literary critic types supposed to be good for something?

You make me mad I missed Robotech.  Blame it on a culturally-deprived childhood.

I will note that I am convinced Salman Rushdie tipped his hat to Douglas Adams in _Satanic Verses_ with the falling-from-the-sky internal monologue early on that reminds me at least of that guy Arthur Dent was always accidentally killing's one as a whale falling to his death....

I believe in Tepper's \_Grass\_ evil My Little Ponies mutated to become kindly Care Wolves in the next stage of the life cycle. It also involved the dust of infected bats. Or something.  

But that doesn't match the existential brilliance of \_The Sun Also Rises As I Lay Dying,\_ in which Darl, the tragically wounded and impotent soldier returning from WWI is kept apart from Lady Brett because he has to help his family cart the decaying dead body of his mother to the great running of the bulls. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll assault Jews and be institutionalized in a mental hospital in Jackson.

_The Sun Also Rises_ is an awesome book.

I especially like how after getting sucker punched by Robert Cohn, Jake "sat down on the pavement." I'm sure Hemingway wanted to end that marvelous sentence with 'gracefully' but it was a silly adverb, and silly adverbs are for weaklings. 

Did you know Hollywood is considering a Robotech film adaptation? I know that'll awaken everyone's childhood dreams of magic movie wonder.

(In which I implicitly confess to knowing way more about this crap than any sane man should...)

Robotech actually more or less made sense if you watched the episodes in their correct order, which of course the end-of-dial UHF stations that broadcast it in the 80s couldn't be bothered to do.  They did do some slight violence to the storylines of all three series to merge them into a single universe, but mostly to "Southern Cross" -- Macross was translated more-or-less accurately, and Mospeada had only cosmetic alterations.  But the three series were supposed to be aired end-to-end, not intermingled.

FYI, I was at a New York Korean Film Festival where they were showing the new Robotech movie.  I think Harmony Gold is trying to generate enough interest to justify a 4th series.

You need to work more pigs' blood into your "House of Sister Carrie Underwood."

Have you perhaps confused Carrie Underwood with Carrie Bradshaw?

ETA Hoffmann's Life And Opinions Of Tomcat Murr mixes two supposedly unrelated narratives together in sensible fashion. It's not quite what you're talking about but it's a great read nonetheless.

The Hoffmann's been on my list a long, long time -- back from my Theory days, when I wanted to read _The Sandman_ to learn about the uncanny.  One of these days, when I have tenure, I'll read all the books people assume I already have.
