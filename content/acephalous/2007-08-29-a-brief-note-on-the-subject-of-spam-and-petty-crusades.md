## A Brief Note on the Subject of Spam and Petty Crusades

I'm nipping this one in the bud quickly.  Yesterday, I sent KC Johnson an email indicating that someone had signed me up for upwards of 80 conservative listservs.  (This happens [all the time](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/08/grow\_up\_loons.php).)  To his credit, he immediately posted a [denunciation](http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2007/08/item-re-scott-kaufman.html) of the person who did it.  

It took me nearly two hours to unsubscribe to all of them.  Needless to say, I have better uses of my time.  Only now, some of his commenters are _demanding_ I prove that I'm not inventing this.  This morning, one [asked](http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2007/08/credentials.html#comment-6574019644160453769):

				Many of the 88 have claimed to have received harassing emails from
"bloggers", yet never produced any. There have been cases in recent
years of both faculty and students in race/class/gender studies areas
caught faking "hate crimes" against themselves.

Is it possible
that Kaufman's harassment claim is also a politically motivated lie?
How can we tell? Does anyone know him well enough personally to say one
way or the other if this is plausible?

Despite
the fact that KC knows me well enough (if only by reputation) to
personally say this is plausible—and despite the fact that I claimed _inconvenience_, not _harassment_—the same commenter decided he wants [answers](http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2007/08/credentials.html#comment-8519163763689277725):
What were the names of the conservative listservs in question? Can at
least one of their administrators confirm that Kaufman's email address
was added and then removed within the last day?

Another [seconds](http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2007/08/editorial-page-extremists.html#comment-264828042125833588) his demand:
I'd like to see proof of Scott Kaufman's allegations.  I flat-out do not believe him.

More
and more often, you see this argument from the outraged fringes. They
turn their sense of disenfranchisement into a pointless crusade. 
Happens daily at [_Jesus's General_](http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/).\*  Happened last week at [_Confederate Yankee_](http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/238473.php).  But it won't happen to me.  I stand partly on principle and partly on the impossibility of doing what they ask of me.\*\*

Whoever signed me up for these listservs used the acephalous (at)
gmail (dot) com address posted on my profile.  What he or she didn't
know is that I don't use that address for private correspondence _and_ that
I have another for online registration.  The reason I don't use it for
private correspondence?  I lost the password, so now I can only receive
mail sent to it via Outlook.  Do you think this is too convenient?  If
you don't believe me now, maybe you'll believe me [then](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/):

Anyone know how to get their Gmail password back if they've lost it? I
can still check that account through Thunderbird, but if this computer
ever crashes, it'll be gone for good. (And no, none of the "recover
your password" options have worked. Thing I hate about Google: no
people anywhere to answer even a simple question.)

Note that I specified Mozilla's Thunderbird in that comment.  I
lied.  As anyone I've sent an email to can tell you, I use Outlook. 
(It's in the headers.)  I didn't think that'd be relevant, so I tried
to keep my open-source street-cred intact.  When I saw all the
Thunderbird-specific fixes, I lied [again](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_5819.html#441686):

Thanks! One down, one more to go. I have another old email, this one
from a former job, but it had to be through Outlook (company machine).
Same problem. Any suggestions?

I never was able to recover the password.  So I can't check the
Gmail archives for the names of all the listservs to which someone (or
someones) subscribed me.  

And I can't check the "Deleted Items" because
I have it set to empty the "Deleted Items" folder whenever I close
Outlook.  

And I can't check my browsing history because I have it set
to "Always clear my private data" when I close Firefox.    

I'm sure someone more technologically competent could retrieve this
information, but I've neither the time nor inclination.  I've a chapter
due in two days.  You'll pardon me if I prioritize that over a petty and pointless
crusade.  

One last thing: AMac's proven himself a _mensch_ in those _Durham-in-Wonderland_ threads.  From this point forward, I'm going to be a little more discriminating in my statements about KC's commentariat (as I should've been from the get-go).  

\*This seems like a suitable place inform new readers what my regulars know: I know from [online harassment](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/).

\*\*You'll note I provided one of them accidentally, as it was the only one
I'd been unable to unsubscribe from this morning.  I've since figured
out how.

All elements of this exchange are absurd (sorry, Scott), from the demand for documentation to the "brief note" in reply.  So of course this incident must be memorialized in deathless poetry.

In Memoriam S.E.K.

Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:  

Thou madest spam, we know not why,  

Spamblockers kill it on the fly  

But some gets through, it is unjust

Our little systems have their day  

And then they fail, and Email swarms  

It takes two hours to reform  

But what has happed to S.E.K?

Avast, these are but fools and slight  

We mock them and we do not fear  

They ask for proof, it is a smear;  

Help S.E.K. his diss to write

Forget these mad and scornful cries  

Confusions of a wasted youth;  

Forgive the wingnuts' lack of truth  

And let indifference make you wise

(I can't wait for the cry -- wait a minute, I think that's familair -- I think he plagiarized Tennyson!)

Scott, 

"They turn their sense of disenfranchisement into a pointless crusade."

That's what wingnuts do.

Except they're not actually disenfranchised, as far as I assume --- they have access to computers and enough time to post hundreds of comments throughout the day, so I'm guessing they're not coal miners or migrant farmworkers.

Who was it used the phrase "the rage of the enfranchised class" to talk about angry republican protesters? I think maybe Lipsitz.

You would lie about which mail program you use?  Wow.
