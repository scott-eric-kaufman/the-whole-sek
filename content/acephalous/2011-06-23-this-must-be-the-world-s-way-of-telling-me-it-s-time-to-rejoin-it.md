They made this just for me, [put it on in Los Angeles](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/21/doctor-who-batman-matt-smith/) and everything, yet somehow I missed it:

Via [Scott McCloud](http://scottmccloud.com/2011/06/23/i-am-the-butterfly-wing-that-caused-the-hurricane-that-tried-to-blow-over-matt-smith/). 

That's right: _**The Doctor** as **Batman** via **Scott McCloud**_. 

And _I missed it_.

Now there's one confusing regeneration.  Maybe it's the kind of thing that happens to Time Lords as they approach their 12th.  The Master might make a good Dr. Doom.

If the Eleventh regenerated into Bruce Wayne, I'd be in a kind of Nerd Heaven that I never thought imaginable.  

There's actually a larger issue here, at least with me, because I've frequently thought that if you let Wayne become 900 years old, he'd essentially become the Doctor: no special powers, per se; a love of toys; a joy taken in outwitting opponents; etc.  The only difference is that the Batman fights, but like the Doctor, abjures the use of guns ... but over time, and with a proliferation of toys, I think the Batman might renounce kicking just as strongly as shooting.

(It's summer, I'm burnt to a crisp, and am allowed this little bit of Nerd Heaven, I do believe.)

Okay, if you have frequently thought this, even [comic book guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Book_Guy) would be entitled to think you need to get out more.

Unfortunately, with a two-hour commute, your choices are limited to 1) actually re-listening to the second hour of _All Things Considered_ or 2) noodling on in your own head about material you're writing book chapters on.  I take it you can see what route I sometimes take.
