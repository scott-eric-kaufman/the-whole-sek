## David Foster Wallace Dead

Of an apparent suicide, according to [Ed Champion](http://www.edrants.com/david-foster-wallace-dead/).  _Los Angeles Times_ [confirms](http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-wallace14-2008sep14,0,246155.story).  

CR’s [reaction](http://adswithoutproducts.com/2008/09/14/dfw/)
nails mine.  Wallace was a brilliant, unpredictable author whose next
book always could’ve been—what I mean to say, if Philip Roth dies, I’ll
be upset, but it wouldn’t tie my stomach in knots.  Roth’s entered the
late-James stage of his career—his works refine and distill and what
readers expect from them.  With Wallace, there was still potential—his
next book could’ve been another _Infinite Jest_, his next story could’ve been utterly unlike _Oblivion_, his next article could’ve done to McCain what Wallace’d done to lobsters.  In short, his unwritten work could’ve been _differently brilliant_.

Thoughts on suicide from a man who’s already committed it, in [_Oblivion_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316010766/diesekoschmar-20)’s “Good Old Neon”:

I simply said, without going into anything like the
level of detail I’ve given you (because my purpose in the letter was of
course very different), that I was killing myself because I was an
essentially fraudulent person who seemed to lack either the character
or the firepower to find a way to stop even after I’d realized my
fraudulence and the terrible toll it exacted . . . I also inserted that
there was also a good possibility that, when all was said and done, I
was nothing but another fact-track yuppie who couldn’t love, and that I
found the banality of this unendurable, largely because I was evidently
so hollow and insecure that I had a pathological need to see myself as
somehow exceptional or outstanding at all times. Without going into
much explanation or argument, I also told Fern that if her initial
reaction to these reasons for my killing myself was to think I was
being much, much too hard on myself, then she should know that I was
already aware that that was the most likely reaction my note would
produce in her, and had probably deliberately constructed the note to
at least in part prompt just that reaction, just the way my whole life
I’d often said and done things designed to prompt certain people to
believe that I was a genuinely outstanding person whose personal
standards were so high that he was far too hard on himself, which in
turn made me appear attractively modest and unsmug, and was a big
reason for my popularity with so many people in all different avenues
of my life . . .” (173)

Of this story, Dan Green [wrote](http://noggs.typepad.com/the\_reading\_experience/2004/08/reviewers\_of\_da.html):

At its core, “Good Old Neon” is indeed a story about a
story, although we don’t know that until its conclusion. We do then
discover, however, that “Good Old Neon” has been an impersonation by
“David Wallace” of one of the latter’s high school classmates who died
in a “fiery single-car accident he’d read about in 1991,” an attempt by
the fictionalized author of _Oblivion_ to “imagine what all
must have happened to lead up to” that crash, why someone “David
Wallace had back then imagined as happy and unreflective and wholly
unhaunted by voices telling him that there was something deeply wrong
with him that wasn’t wrong with anybody else and that he had to spend
all his time and energy trying to figure out what to do and say in
order to impersonate an even marginally normal or acceptable U.S. male”
would drive into a bridge abutment.

It is a wholly convincing impersonation, and emotionally charged in
a way we perhaps don’t expect from David Foster Wallace. And it is
precisely in the act of “baring the device”—the story self-reflexively
disclosing that it is indeed a story—that “Good Old Neon” produces its
greatest emotional effect. For in addition to the genuine human feeling
for the distress of its imagined protagonist the story encourages in
us, even more compelling is the revelation that it was some such
feeling on its author’s part that led “David Wallace” to write the
story in the first place.

Yikes.  Very different than the suicide of, say, Tom Disch, whose books I've been re-reading, and who signposted his suicide so many times in his work that the tragedy had the feeling of something long-worked-out.

The quoted bit from _Oblivion_ is throwing me irresistibly into self-narrative mode.  Well, what the hell -- why be a bad poet unless you are going to maunder on about yourself?  So here it is:

On Hearing Of Another Death

I'd never kill myself  

The love of dear people, their aging and growing up  

The hate of those creeps who I'm going to see go down  

Love tattooed on one lobe,  hate on the other  

Attached, non-Buddha-fashion, I will laugh at the last  

I've told my partner not to turn me off even as a vegetable  

Attached to life support, machines bleeping  

I'll lie there in the way, bankrupting somebody  

Hanging on by one last gurgle   

One last second of a dream

Still stunned since hearing the news last night. I put up a [MetaFilter post](http://www.metafilter.com/74869/RIP-DFW) that's had over 300 stunned-into-silence comments that I think is worth reading, as well as (just now) [a longer and more retrospective obituary post at my own site](http://gerrycanavan.blogspot.com/2008/09/david-foster-wallace-me-warts-and-all.html).

Is it true he left a 1,000+ page suicide note or is that just a rumor?
