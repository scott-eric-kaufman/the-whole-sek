Because he also [saw something terrible happen at a theater](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/04/how-do-you-make-a-batman.html).  The only person who thinks that guy would support filling the air of a  crowded theater with crossfire would be a good idea would be [the one who drew him](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/10/holy-terror-frank-miller-my-how-far-youve-fallen.html).

'Course, 108 pages earlier, Batman straight-up shoots a Mutant, point-blank, in the face with a machine gun.

_Batman straight-up shoots a Mutant, point-blank, in the face with a machine gun._

Technically, the Mutant was holding the child (and holding a gun to said child's head), but I don't think Batman gets any less old as the book progresses...

Scott: I was employing the very compelling argument "Yeah, well, _because_." Please don't deign to dignify me with a response.
