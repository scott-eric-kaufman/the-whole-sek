If you're coming here from [Uniwatch](http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/09/04/have-you-no-sense-of-decency-sir-at-long-last-have-you-left-no-sense-of-decency/), I want it to be absolutely clear that that "Scott" is, for whatever reason, impersonating me.  (Know how you can tell?  Because I can post here and write this and he can't.)

I have absolutely no idea what that was about, but do want to thank the person from Uniwatch who clicked through, realized that wasn't me and dropped me a line.

Perhaps it was his great desire to be you.
