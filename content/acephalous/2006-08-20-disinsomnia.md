On The Couch

You are sitting on the couch.  It is 10:00 PM.  On your lap is a cat.  To your left is a cat.  To your right is a cat.  The second disc of [
House
](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009WPM1Q/diesekoschmar-20) is on the table.

&gt; go to bed

You watch two episodes of 
House
 and are impressed by the frequency of improbable events which occur in the Princteon-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

&gt; go to bed

You watch two more episodes of 
House
 and are impressed by the frequency of improbable events which occur in the Princteon-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

&gt; go to bed

The third disc of 
House
 is on the table.

&gt; take nyquil

Despite the dangers associated with taking over-the-counter medication when no symptoms present ... 

&gt; "no symptoms present"?

Are you even listening?  Ahem: 

You have watched four episodes of 
House
 and have been impressed by the frequency of improbable events which occur in the Princteon-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.  You're practically a doctor.

&gt; intubate someone

You are ALONE in your apartment, 
House
 isn't about veternarians, and self-intubation would most likely be fatal.   

&gt; don't intubate someone

A fine decision.  Now, as I was saying: 

Despite the dangers associated with taking over-the-counter medication when no symptoms present, you walk into the kitchen and drink a capful of green liquid which promises freedom from the sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head, fever you don't have.  So you can rest.  Medicine.  However, it succeeds only in making you extremely drowsy.

&gt; wake up

I thought you wanted to go to sleep.

&gt; go to bed

You watch two more episodes of 
House
 and are impressed by the frequency of improbable events which occur in the Princteon-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.  At this pace, you will run out of 
House
 in two hours.

&gt; send back Netflix

Because the mailman will work on Sunday just for you?

&gt; crap

You can say that again.

&gt; crap

I didn't say anything would happen if you did, dipshit.

&gt; go to bed

Can't say I didn't warn you: 

You watch two more episodes of 
House

and are impressed by the frequency of improbable events which occur in
the Princteon-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.  Congratulations, you have run out of 
House
.

&gt; read book

In your condition?  You can hardly keep your eyes open, mate.

&gt; THEN GO TO BED

You flip channels in search of a mindless movie to watch.  [
Can't Hardly Wait
](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000F0AD/diesekoschmar-20) is on HBO2, but [
The Sea Wolf
](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6302717779/diesekoschmar-20) is on AMC and watching it is, arguably, productive.  Which one do ...

&gt; 
Can't Hardly Wait

You watch 
Can't Hardly Wait
 and, again, notice yourself pining for the closing credits as the movie turns from innocuous to unwatchable pap with twenty minutes left.  Also, the Nyquil has worn off.

&gt; drink whiskey copiously

Bad idea.

&gt; drink whiskey copiously

You'll get no work done tomorrow.  

&gt; DRINK WHISKEY COPIOUSLY

I'm sorry, Dave.  I can't let you do that.

&gt; stop creeping me out

Without your space helmet, Dave ...

&gt; put on space helmet

You don't have a space helmet, Scott.  You DO, however, always fall asleep during the last 20 minutes of 
2001
.  I give up.  HAL was right about one thing, Scott: This conversation can serve no purpose anymore.  Goodbye.  But before I go, a gift:

"Drink Whiskey" ...? Please tell me, Scott, that you're not polluting yourself with Whiskey when there's plenty of life-giving Whisky in the world.

Sadly, the best whisky I can afford is not nearly so good as Jameson, the best whiskey I can afford.  Sadder still, the actual reason I didn't drink was because dawn was breaking, and unless you haven't stopped drinking, there's something uncouth about starting at dawn.
