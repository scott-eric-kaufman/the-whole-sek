Can you guess the song I'm paraphrasing?

My lover doesn't cheat on me  
Because she is so in love with me, I know this.  
However, maybe she really wants to cheat on me,  
But fears I would leave her if she did.  
She should ignore those impulses, though,  
Because even the thought of her thinking about cheating on me   
Makes me want to commit suicide.  

You think you understand this, but you don't;  
And because you don't, what we have will inevitably die.  
So we're together for right now, absolutely,  
But because you're thinking of cheating on me,   
We shouldn't be.  

If the clich√© about all goods things coming to an end is true,  
What you and I have is no exception.  
To pretend otherwise is pure folly.  
In the meantime, however,  
We should [shake it, shake it, shake it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIv8-tYorRk#t=5m50s)  
Shake it like a Polaroid picture.

So I give the game away in the last two lines, but honestly, did you have any clue that _that_ was the actual content of the happiest song most people will ever hear in their entire life? 

Now, on an absolutely related note, can you guess how I'm teaching my students about the difference between form and content on Thursday?

That last line is an odd one: it references technology which is effectively obsolete and almost, but not quite, gone, and probably unfamiliar to a large portion of the audience (though the video does a very literal translation). It's a surprisingly specific reference in anotherwise very abstract bit of verse.

Actually, I picked up on what song it was after the first 3 lines.  But maybe I'm weird.

Also, the shout out to Mom and Dad somehow was lost in your paraphrasing.  Did you consider that unimportant to the overall message of the song?

Just before the give away I thought of Hey Ya, as those lyrics stand out about love not being an exception.  If you changed the language more, might have missed it.

_That last line is an odd one: it references technology which is effectively obsolete and almost, but not quite, gone, and probably unfamiliar to a large portion of the audience (though the video does a very literal translation)._

I've always thought of the song as having been written to accommodate that particular line.  I have no evidence that this is true, but it's such a fabulous line, I want it to be.  What I mean is, the entire song is about good things fading into the past and dancing anyway, so the reference to the Polaroid picture picks up on the whole idea of mourning for a good thing as it slips into obsolescence, only that thing is actually a device that freezes time, but you can't freeze time, so shut up and shake it, shake it, shake it.

_Also, the shout out to Mom and Dad somehow was lost in your paraphrasing. Did you consider that unimportant to the overall message of the song?_

I don't think so.  I excluded that line, a few others, and the chorus in order to mask the identity of the song a few beats longer.  The idea is for the final line flips the light bulb on, as induced epiphanies tend to stick with students longer than me just telling them something.  That said, it seems I didn't alter the rhythm of the first few lines enough to make them unrecognizable.  Must go tweak now.

It should be noted that Polaroid released an official statement strongly advising against shaking Polaroid photos before the image is fully developed:

That's two votes for more tweaking, now.  See, this is why the internet is awesome: so long as the students don't check the blog, my excerise will be that much better by the time I actually teach it.

_I've always thought of the song as having been written to accommodate that particular line._

There are songs like that: one line stands out as being particularly fine, and often it does seem like that song was written from that line outward. Usually the line is in the chorus and/or title ([Malcolm](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2005/05/thursday-lyrics-malcolm-solves-his.html), or ["The Kind of Love You Never Recover From"](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2005/06/thursday-lyric-kind-of-love-you-never.html)), or it's a [punch line](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2006/02/thursday-lyric-zen-gospel-singing.html) at the end (the Outkast seems to be kind of like that, too, though not in the shaggy-dog style). In [Gonzo's song](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2006/02/bouncy-but-firm-incompetent-but.html), it's the beginning of the last full verse -- there's no doubt in my mind that it was that line first, and the rest of the song later.

Funny timing.  I read the lyrics to this song a few days ago, thereby ruining your surprise (but gaining a greater appreciation for the song).

Yes.  

Honestly, I want to slit my very old wrists every time I hear that line in "B.O.B."  You know: 

But this'll be the year that we won't forget

One-Nine-Nine-Nine . . .

And then I remember that Paul Westerberg just turned fifty, and to quote Jon Stewart: _you're not helping_. 

Anyway, POWER MUSIC, ELECTRIC REVIVAL!  POWER MUSIC, ELECTRIC REVIVAL!\*

\*Because old as that lyric makes you feel, hearing the actual song makes you feel young again.

Yes! Which is odd, because I usually don't pay much attention to lyrics.  For me what was great about that song always had something to do with the contrast between the melancholy lyrics and the exuberant music.  'Hey ya' in the chorus sounds like a world weary shrug.  Let's get out the booze and have a ball, I say.

As both a musicologist and a hopeless pedant, let me point out that musical content needs to be acknowledged as at least as important as lyrical content when determining a song's "actual" content.  If most of the people who hear the song think of it as a happy song, I'd say that's pretty clear evidence that, for a lot of people, affective content (which, in this case, is predominantly musical) is "the actual content" of this song, regardless of the lyrics.  Not that a pissing match over which type of content is stronger is in any way worthwhile, since, as DR points out, the contrast is the point for lots of folks, and since very few listeners are likely to be listening so intently to either the lyrics or the music that they completely miss the other side.

I would argue that the conflict between musical content and lyrical content is stronger here than the content/form division.  Not to read your mind via Teh Series of Tubez, but I suspect that much of what you're calling "form" here is better explained as "affect" (which opens up a whole 'nother content/form can of worms, but one that would probably be more relevant in one of my classes than in one of yours).

You're absolutely correct here.  My intent is to disabuse them of the notion that they should trust their ears and eyes, because this is a research methodology class and, for example, when they see someone has the letters P, H and D after their name, they assume he or she is authoritative.  I'm trying to get them to understand that validity of claims is more important than a multiplicity of titles.  So, basically, this is an object lesson designed to make them more attentive and, yes, suspicious.

Yes I did, because I'd heard the [Obadiah Parker cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c745E7T\_Wvg) which makes the sadness of the content explicit in the musical form.

Great example.  

Also, I'd always heard it as "Bible music, electric revival."  That's the sort of fact that's both cause and effect of my ignoring lyrics.

Glad someone got Obadiah Parker into the discussion--theirs is my preferred version, one that accounts for the deep, wistful sadness of the song.

No no no. A thousand times no. I hate with the white-hot intensity of a thousand suns when people take "frivolous" songs and do them "wistfully" so you can tell "it's actually really meaningful."

Well, I can listen to music AND words, and I don't need the big neon sign of someone soulfully strumming on an acoustic guitar to tell me "Oh, maybe I better slow down and take a listen - something SIGNIFICANT might be going down here."

"... theirs is my preferred version, one that accounts for the deep, wistful sadness of the song."

You don't think Andre 3000 accounts for that sadness? He PUT IT THERE!
