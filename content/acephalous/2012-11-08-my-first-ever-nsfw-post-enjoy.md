One of the issues with teaching _Game of Thrones_ is that nudity is treated very casuallyâ€”so casually that the very idea of watching it with your mother feels deeply wrong. But it must be accounted for, and one of my classes decided to name the regular appearance of casual nudity after scenes in which Peter Baelish conducts important business while people behind him are getting down to business. (About which more shortly.) Today we were discussing [scenes in which wolves and lions were isolated](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/11/game-of-thrones-everyone-is-alone-everyone-is-surrounded-in-the-wolf-and-the-lion.html), and I was pointing out that in the exchange between Bran and Maester Luwin, the director prefers to give each of them their own frame instead allowing them to share a single. So I'm letting the scene run as I speak:

[![LITTLEFINGER11](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d6bd058970c-500wi "LITTLEFINGER11")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d6bd058970c-popup)

When all of a sudden I look out at the class and everyone is staring at me. Not in that glass-eyed way that they normally do, but with an intensity that made me [
want to ask them about their corn
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/large\_children\_of\_the\_corn\_blu-ray\_1.jpg). So I said:

[![Littlefingering07](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4e12dcc970d-500wi "Littlefingering07")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4e12dcc970d-popup)

More corn-eyes. So I asked again:

[![Littlefingering07a](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c333d55a9970b-500wi "Littlefingering07a")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c333d55a9970b-popup)

At which point one brave soul spoke up: "Scott," he said, "Quit Littlefingering us."
