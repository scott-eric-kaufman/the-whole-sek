For some strange Reason, certain People think that academic Prose must follow the _[Rechtschreibreform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_spelling\_reform\_of\_1996#Capitalization)._ Such is the Case no matter how many Times i say: "Students, Your Essays should adhere to the Rules of american Orthography."Â  What their Problem is, i offer not even a Guess.

Do the people whose spelling is lousily phonetic on formal essays spell correctly in an informal context?

(_searches post for non-intentional errors, finds none, thinks he must be grading too much today_)

Oddly, they do.  The anxiety attendant to essay-writing screws with their normal prose circuitry.  For example, my best student---whose blog posts are full of controlled complex sentences---completely punts some of his clauses in his essay.  Mostly it's the understandable urge to "sound smart," but in some cases it's genuinely smart students trying to stretch their language to meet to standards of the academic context.  (But even then, some of them resort to german Nouns.)

Or are they reverting, as it were, _atavistically_, to the eighteenth Century?

For my students, it's at least partially a result of the combination of textbook orthography -- in which important terms are **highlighted** and there's a tendency to overcapitalize terms of art -- and the use of old texts, both original English documents with archaic Germanic capitalization and the use of pre-copyright translations, often products of the same 19th century Germanic tradition.

When someone complains about other people's mistakes, they should at least be sure they capitalize their first-person pronouns.

Those who miss the joke and attack the joker, well, I hope they don't teach.

When those without humor read jokes  

They oft end up looking like dopes  

We need some release  

it helps keep the peace  

Be gentle, we're just plain folks.
