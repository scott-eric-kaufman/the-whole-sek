## A Question About "My Morning"

Not that I'm in trouble—at least it doesn't _sound_ like I'm in trouble—but I wonder why someone took it upon him- or herself to forward a copy of my post to the [Office of the President of the University of California](http://www.ucop.edu/)?  It was then forwarded to UCI's [Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity](http://www.eod.uci.edu/) which—you guessed it—is "responsible for the University's compliance with federal and state
laws and University policies and procedures regarding discrimination,
retaliation and sexual harassment."  

I'm interested in hearing from the person who forwarded this to the Office of the President.  Did he or she think I handled the situation inappropriately?  Can he or she suggest how I could have handled it better?  All recommendations must be filed in the comments section before 10:00 A.M. Friday morning, as that's when I have to meet with an OEOD investigator.

That's ridiculous.  Shouldn't you be the one making complaints?  It was your office, after all.

I would guess that the administrators' decision to take it seriously results from a wish to discipline the kids and not you.  Still, as Jon McGee sez, if you didn't file a complaint yourself, they should devote their energies to other things.

Your blog should have a banner:

How's my blogging?   

president@ucop.edu

Or maybe provide your dissertation advisor's address?

BTW how many English speaking people are there online? Somewhere out there is someone with a problem for everybody.

Blech.  That's surprisingly uncivil.

That's...bizarre. You related a true-life anecdote that happened to you. You did nothing to ID the couple other than to note one was male and the other female; no mention of their age, color, identifying tatoos or moles, nor of genitalia size. 

Also, I think it's reasonable to assume your office has a certain amount of sanctity about it; dunno if the door was locked or not but it still sounds like they were guilty of B&E...or at least E. 

While your office may have a 'certain amount of sanctity' the school is still a public place, and doesn't UCI have rules about public lewdness or are there couples screwing all over that campus?

"Sexual Harrasment" is a ludicrous accusation: Assuming your story is true (and I have no reason to doubt it), you made no comments, overt or implied, of a sexual nature nor did you lay hands on either of the persons in a 'private place.' OTOH, I bet they were damn uncomfortable, but that's their own doing.

The couple, however, if you can ID them, can and should be brought up on charges of sexual harrasment. I suspect you were pretty uncomfortable with the whole thing. You asked them to stop their sexually-related acts and they refused; in fact, when asked to do so, one of them got downright hostile. 

Man, someone sure is looking at this thing all bass-ackwards.

i work at a uni in your family, too. i think you were the one harassed. you did nothing wrong, you even stepped out so they could dress and leave. i would have stood there tapping my foot. if they're looking into this, it's crazy.

They're INVESTIGATING?!  I hope they purchase you a coffee and commiserate while the locksmith (that they better bring) goes about his/her business.

I am also a Ph.D. student and was originally disappointed that my university didn't provide me with my own office; instead, a bunch of us use the same space at designated times.  After reading your posts, I've been reconsidering my dissapointment.  One question, though: What happened in your meeting with the OEOD investigator?

Anthony, I won't know until tomorrow morning.  I hope nothing, but I've a feeling the student has filed an official sexual harassment complaint against me.  Believe you me, I'll either post an enraged or relieved entry tomorrow.

Also, I should note that Victor's assessment of why any claim of public humiliation would be ludicrous is spot-on.  I provided no means to identify the students; the only way they could be identified is if they came forward . . . and that should undermine their claim that they've experienced "mental anguish" because of me.

I imagine that you've contacted a lawyer so that you can [sue for libel](http://info-theory.blogspot.com/2005/11/case-for-libel.html) your the complainant and then engage in a witchhunt to unmask any anonymous blogger who may have helped him or her?
