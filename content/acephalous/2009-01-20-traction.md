## Traction?

What are
the odds that conservatives will claim Obama’s flubbing of the oath of
office was but the first of many mistakes?  Set aside the fact that
Roberts goofed by asking Obama to repeat something other than [the Oath of Office of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath\_of\_office#United\_States) — “I do solemnly swear that I will execute the Office of President of the United States _faithfully_” instead of “I do solemnly swear that I will _faithfully_ execute
the Office of President of the United States.”  Set aside the fact that
Obama graciously gave Roberts a beat to correct himself.  Set aside the
fact that this is but one more example of a Bush appointee not sweating
the small stuff when it mattered most.

This supposed flub will be the rhetorical starting gate for all
holistic criticisms of the Obama Administration: “From the moment an
unprepared Obama punted the Oath of Office, America started sucking . .
.”

Are you seriously wondering if the patron saint of the party of "Bushitler" is going to be subject to unfair criticism?  Since he's, or is it "He's", been anointed The One, I would think that criticisms that show him to be perfectly and utterly human like the rest of us would be more than fair.

Roberts not only misplaced the "faithfully", he said "_to_ the United States", which makes no sense. Inauguration void!
