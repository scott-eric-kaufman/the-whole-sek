## The Etiology of Nightmares; or, You Be My Freud!

Last night I dreamt I couldn't move.  My dream began and ended with me prostrate and paralyzed on an unkempt dirt floor.  I've never had a dream half so dull or  claustrophobic before.  For uncountable hours I spit up the turf I'd otherwise inhale.  The tang of organic compost permeated my every thought ... all of which were hummed to [this tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLkC8l3nJro), causing me to wonder whether I wasn't dreamily demanding you recognize me.  I float on!  Float on!  

Because I'm William Blake:

Don't you know my poetry?\*

If this post makes no sense, it's only because I couldn't find video of the closing scenes of Jim Jarmusch's _Dead Man_.  Why did I fail?  Because Johnny Depp thought it'd be a good idea to star in _another_ movie prominently featuring the words "dead" and "man" in the title, thereby rendering Google more useless than useless.

Freud?  No, but the Modest Mouse video that you linked to featured lots of camera angles from ground level, and lots of (counting) sheep.  There's your connection.

Had you eaten a lot of _cheese_ immediately prior to going to bed?

_Freud? No, but the Modest Mouse video that you linked to featured lots of camera angles from ground level, and lots of (counting) sheep._

This is why I'm so upset about _Dead Man's Chest_.  _Dead Man_ haunts me mind much more forcefully than Modest Mouse, my fanboy love notwithstanding.  Have you seen _Dead Man_?  Not for the kids, but if you haven't seen it, you should.  I think you'd love it.

_Had you eaten a lot of cheese immediately prior to going to bed?_

What does cheese have to do with the price of tea in my dreamt China?\*

\*The fact that I'm responding to this at 4:06 a.m. Pacific Awesome Time has nothing to do with eating cheese or the dread my unconscious will unearth should I choose to cross it.

A suggestion from the only librarian on record as liking you.  Try the following query string at youtube

Depp "dead man" -chest -pirates

That might yield more fruit.

I tried that, Pat, but I'm still just getting that same single YouTube tribute to Depp's beautiful death.  Which is nice and all, what with the authentic Neil Young soundtrack and all, but still gussies up the film with pretensions of plottedness.

On dream interpretation, surely you've answered the immediate question yourself.  It seems to be a death anxiety dream, which it seems to me are also about anxieties around powerlessness.  One could also argue that it's about a fear of paralysis and all that that implies.

Your dreams have a soundtrack?  That seems a little bit heavy-handed of your subconscious.  It's a reassuring song choice though.  If you wanted something more along the lines of the unsettled feel of the film, you might choose that Pearl Jam song, "(Can't Find a) Deader Man."

The closest I can come to a clip is [this](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7864744901924091166&q=gary+farmer+depp&ei=ve5PSKqGC4eQ4wLryZDDDA&hl=en), though it ends before the final movement of the canoe through the water, that I think you were referring to.  For still images you might go with [this](http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/films/mx/deadman/pics/dead06.jpg) or [this](http://hometown.aol.com/horseygurl127/images/dead%!m(MISSING)an.jpg).

Remarkable not only because the first time I saw that movie I was in Athens (Κληβελαντ;) even more so because it lead me to [this young Crispin Glover on Happy Days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL0ew-k46bg).
