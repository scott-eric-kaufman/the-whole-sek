All the talk about how Sarah Palin's 
_magnum opus_
 _[opera mictilis](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how\_not\_to\_open.html?cid=6086767#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef00d83448626353ef)_ is [already a bestseller](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/30/amazing-palins-book-number-one-on-both-amazon-and-barnes-noble-bestseller-list/) flubs the basic math behind its "[unprecedented sales](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27773.html)." Palin's target audience already has a Bible, meaning [_Going Rogue_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061939897/diesekoschmar-20) will be the first book they've bought [since 2007](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0842361901/diesekoschmar-20). If liberals want to wage ideological war via the bestseller list, we need to stop dividing our loyalties and only purchase _one new book every two years_. Our minds might atrophy, sure, but no one ever said talking points were cheap.
\*What? Can you think of a better way to tell the world that [you judge books by their covers](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/30/amazing-palins-book-number-one-on-both-amazon-and-barnes-noble-bestseller-list/comment-page-8/#comment-2787582) than a comma splice? Didn't think so.

Well, as D. G. Myers [says,](http://dgmyers.blogspot.com/2009/10/link-also-rises.html) "If only because of the reaction it will provoke on the literary Left, youâ€™ve got to appreciate this book jacket."

Am I looking at the wrong book jacket??? I was looking forward to a provocation, and all I get is Sarah Palin in a windbreaker?

I don't know, I thought the American flag pin on a windbreaker was kind of provocative.  Plus the title.

I think this is another example of Myers being inscrutable on a whim.  I mean, unless it's a Member's Only windbreaker, in which case all the liberal Duckies will agonize over the perpetual victory of the conservative Blaines . . . but that makes no sense.

Forget the cover - Do we really need to hear more about her "WONDERFUL LIFE!!"  Of course she needs to work now that her husband has left his job.  Poor kids how will they make it in todays world when everything cost sooooo much.
