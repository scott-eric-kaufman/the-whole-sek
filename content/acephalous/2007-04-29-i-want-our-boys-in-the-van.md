## I Want Our Boys in the Van

Life would be so much easier if I had them.  Imagine my job talk:
**Q:** So what do you think the implications of this are for a Deleuzian discourse which rejects anagenetic in favor of a more rhizomatic cladogenetic theory of the dissemination of ideas in the body social?

**A:** Off the top of my head, I'm not sure.  I'll have our boys in the van look into it and get back to you on that one.  To get back to topic of my talk, I think [_many brilliant things about the impact of evolutionary theory on turn-of-the-last-century American culture, and I relate them for approximately five minutes_] ... could the gentlemen who asked the question about Deleuze please stand up?  So, one of the boys in the van is telling me that he wouldn't be so quick to align Deleuzian thought with cladogenetic accounts.  He's saying cladogenetic and anagenetic accounts are often complementary, inasmuch as the changes of the frequency of traits within a population (anagenesis) is what eventually causes speciation (cladogenesis).  He's also informed me that the word "cladogenesis" means "the origins of branches."

**[Tim McCarver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim\_McCarver):** I did not know that.  I would have said "trees," but that would have to be seeds, [which you plant in the ground](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim\_McCarver#Stating\_the\_obvious).  Amazing what boys can dig up in the van these days.

You know those montages in pop-noir films like _Ocean's Eleven_? Where they "assemble the team"? It was foolish to think the crimes of theory would take any fewer.

Maybe Chris Clarke would want to [join](http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/as\_the\_joshua\_tree\_book\_gets\_ever\_more\_complicated/) [the](http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/understanding/) [A-Team](http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/what\_really\_bothers\_the\_creationists/)!  I see him as Howling Mad Murdock, myself.  Maybe PZ Myers could be the "I love it when a plan comes together" guy.  Now you just need a Face and a B.A. [or better, Ph.D.] Baracus and you're set....

Maybe [this guy](http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/may/tribute-linnaeus.php) could be Ph.D. Baracus.

You make up the best gibberish words Scott, "cladogenetic", "Deleuzian", I love it! 

There's more I'd like to say but I don't have time - it's nearly brillig and I'm \_frumious\_ for a snark (as long as it's not a boojum, boojum's are rhizomatic as you know). Adieu until anon.

I am commenting in this thread to register my opposition to the "strike."
