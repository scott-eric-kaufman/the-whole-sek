(_This post will self-destruct before the Google-spiders spy it._)

Below the fold you'll find a copy of my cover letter.  It's your typical—or what I've been told is "your typical"—four graph affair: 

1.  introduction
2.  summary of dissertation
3.  basic teaching philosophy (as related to the dissertation)
4.  contact information

I'm not happy with it.  We'll see what my advisor thinks this afternoon.  (That was an audible _gulp_ you heard.)  This is, of course, only a template.  I could venture into much more detail about any of these points depending on the demands of the job I'm applying for, but even where templates are concerned, the shorter and punchier, the better.  Is this short and punchy enough?

				Dear Professor \_\_\_\_\_:

I am writing to apply for the position of \_\_\_\_\_ advertised in the \_\_\_\_\_ Job Information List.  I completed my Ph.D. in English at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), where I specialized in nineteenth and early twentieth century American literature and culture.  In addition to the interest that shaped my dissertation—the generic history of realism and naturalism and the historical development of evolutionary theory—during my time at UCI, I helped develop the curriculum and standards for the only undergraduate program in literary journalism in the UC system.  As the editor of the online journal _The Valve_, I have organized symposia on books directly related to the literary studies, such as Nancy Armstrong’s _How Novels Think_ and Amanda Claybaugh’s _The Novel of Progress_, as well as books by literary scholars pertaining to the public sphere, such as Michael Bérubé’s _What’s Liberal about the Liberal Arts?_ and Walter Benn Michael’s _The Trouble with Diversity_.

My dissertation, “Maximal Diversity: Non-Darwinian Evolutionary Theory in American Fiction, 1895-1910,” argues against the tradition of literary critics who consider “social Darwinism” the ascendant evolutionary influence on _fin de siècle_ literary and popular culture.  It examines how non-Darwinian evolutionary theory manifests in the works of writers traditionally interpreted in light of Darwinian notions like “survival of the fittest,” but who are as distinct in theme, genre and mode as Mark Twain, Edith Wharton, Jack London, and Silas Weir Mitchell.  My thesis is that Richard Hofstadter’s powerful argument in 1944’s _Social Darwinism in American Thought_ compelled later critics to distort the literature of the period by reading it as if the caricatured Darwinism of anti-eugenic polemics was the only evolutionary theory in which writers of the time trafficked.  Each chapter reevaluates literary influence accomplishment in light of the actual evolutionary theories which influenced these writers.  Chapter One, “The Ambivalent Naturalist: The Authority of Evolutionary Rhetoric in Edith Wharton’s ‘The Descent of Man’ and _The House of Mirth_,” documents how Wharton’s struggles against the environmental determinism manifest as structural elements of her narrative, such that the plight of Lily Bart is less an illustration of a particular evolutionary theory than a narrative experiment in evolutionary speculation.  Chapter Two, “Accelerating Evolution: Social Reform and the Baldwin Effect in Jack London’s The Iron Heel and Before Adam,” addresses the apparent contradiction that has long dogged London scholars: “How can London have been both a social Darwinist and a socialist?”  By focusing on the idiosyncratic amalgam of evolutionary theory London forged, I reconcile London’s socialism with his evolutionary beliefs by showing the latter to Lamarckian, and thus not incommensurable with his commitment to progressivism, as demonstrated in the literary works he wrote during 1906.  In Chapter Three, “Novel Form: The Expression of Character in Silas Weir Mitchell’s Revolutionary Romances,” I demonstrate how non-Darwinian theory was integrated into popular historical romances for what was perceived, by America’s foremost neurologist, to be the salutary influence of progressive evolutionary narratives on national character.  My final chapter, “Evidence of Influence: Francis Galton’s Finger Prints on Mark Twain’s _Pudd’nhead Wilson_,” is a study of immediate literary influence, in that it attempts to discern the direct effects Francis Galton’s neo-Darwinian theories of racial development had on Mark Twain’s theories of racial evolution when he encountered them in November 1892.  

My research into the persistence of convenient assumptions about historical fact and literary influence has informed my teaching.  Students in my classroom are encouraged to cultivate a healthy skepticism of conventional wisdom.  Thus, in teaching “Realism & Romance,” the novelistic course in UCI’s introductory sequence on literary studies, I prepared my students to discuss the assumptions about race across a spectrum of canonical novels—from _Don Quijote_ to _Wuthering Heights_ to _Light in August_—through lectures that provided the historical and generic context in which these works were written.  Class discussions would focus on how the literary qualities of these texts challenged the conventional wisdom as presented in my lecture, thereby fostering an environment in which students could openly critique the generalities of overarching narratives by appealing to the particularities of literary works.  This attention to detail also informed my teaching of literary journalism.  In the introductory course I designed with the program’s director, Barry Siegel, I taught students to build their articles on a foundation of solid reportage that included both the basics of print journalism—how to read police blotters, how to petition for interviews—and those techniques particular to literary journalism—detailed archival work and extensive interviews with subjects in whose worlds students immersed themselves.  My years in the literary journalism department reminded me that my commitment to detail must begin with the basics I taught in composition, because even those students who dream of being published in the _New Yorker_ need instruction in the mechanics of a sentence, the coherence of a paragraph, and the structure of an essay.

My curriculum vitae is enclosed. My dossier, with confidential letters of reference, will be forwarded by the UCI Career Center. I plan to attend the MLA conference in San Francisco . . . .

I wouldn't think you have to say what happens in each chapter of your dissertation (though your supervisor--of course--knows best!). My own experience (on both sides of this process) is that nobody is actually \*that\* interested in your dissertation--sorry!--except for being reassured that it is done and you are looking ahead to your book project (which you don't mention? "As I revised this for publication, I will do X"??). I like the teaching stuff. As I recall, we were encouraged to (and, now, we like candidates who) say something about the kinds of courses we would teach (from the existing curriculum) and develop (to enhance the existing curriculum).

My own supervisor's somewhat enigmatic response to my cover letter was that it "represented [me] well." I stared at it for a long time trying to figure out what exactly he meant. I think now that his point was I just said what I did, or had done, with really no rhetorical flourishes. I didn't get waves of interviews, but of the three places I gave on-campus interviews, I got two offers, so I think the idea is, give a clear sense of who you are so that if they like what they see in your letter, they will like you in person--you will be who they expect, if you see what I mean. Now, in your case, they might just read your blog ... which I notice you don't explicitly  mention (maybe it's on your CV).

Book project, yes, I need to add that.  I'll talk to my advisor about excluding some of the specific chapter descriptions---the Weir Mitchell, in particular.  I didn't include curricular development stuff on the template, because that's going to vary from institution to institution, but the stuff about literary journalism is meant to suggest one solid option I offer a department.

I'd ditch the word "generic" very, very quickly. You never want to portray your work as "generic"; even if you think so, you're communicating with people who think their work is special, particular. And yours is, too.

I'd second the call to trim the dissertation stuff somewhat: you're probably going to be including an abstract with a lot of these applications anyway, so it's more important to frame it in the context of the works and scholarship than to rehash the arguments.

"showing the latter to Lamarckian,"

Proofread.  It should be "showing the latter to \*be\* Lamarkian",   Also, some of your sentences sound a bit too boilerplate-ish."Students in my classroom are encouraged to cultivate a healthy skepticism of conventional wisdom."  As opposed to how it is in most classrooms, where it's conventional wisdom all the way?

Your intro para is roughly in thirds, diss /teaching / blogging.  Then you don't say anything about blogging and associated conferences etc.  Perhaps shorten the second and third paras and put in a short fourth one about it?

Ahistoricality, "generic" there means "genre-based."  Yes, it's terrible that that's the word we have, but it is.  And I'm trimming---as in, "currently in another window"---the diss. stuff.  Oddly, I was told to have the letter and abstract echo each other, so as to be more solid and memorable.  (Can't remember which dissertation workshop I heard this in, though.)

Rich, if anything, this thing's over-proofread, not under-.  Given that the first job I'm applying for is a few weeks away, I'm hoping to have it done-ish now so I can look at it with clear eyes later.  As for the blogging aspect, well, that's another story.  I'm not sure how to handle it---Marc Bousquet has some ideas (which I'm hitting him up for) about how to sell it, but as it stands, it seems "online journal" and "symposia" are the best way to normalize the activity for a non-online audience.

I've never gotten a job offer, so take this for what it's worth.  I think the thing as a whole is quite good.  Two thoughts:

The opening paragraph needs the most work.  The "I completed my Ph.D. in English..." sentence needs to be two sentences.  Even if Rohan Maitzen is right and nobody really cares about your dissertation, you need to convince them that you have a clever, intriguing idea.  Do you have a punchy one sentence version of the diss?  Something like, "demonstrates the previously unrecognized diversity of evolutionary thought in ... literature"?

I'm with rich on the symposia stuff needing it's own paragraph.  I would cut the details out of the first paragraph and drop them into a later paragraph on service and professional development (you've mentioned previously service in symposia, your conference presentations, etc.)  I think you're right the "blogging" itself is not the hook, but it could fit into a broader pitch of: puts stuff out there, can organize stuff and would serve on committees without too much grumbling.

I agree with others that you should trim the diss chapter summary.  Penn advised us to include a dissertation document with our dossier (a one paragraph summary and one paragraph for each chapter).

Consider moving the teaching paragraph to the forefront for 3/3 or 4/4 jobs (if you're applying for any).  But you might want to reframe a teaching-job letter entirely.

I found the teaching paragraph weaker than the research paragraph.  What are your ultimate goals as a teacher?  To ask students to question received wisdom?  That's a bit vague.  How will you achieve them?  Through class discussion?  You don't want to come off as the "wacky teacher," but try to locate some concrete detail about your teaching that might stand out from the crowd of letters about "critical thinking" and "active learning."

Some wee things:

1.  The parenthesis in the first paragraph is distracting and creates too long a wind-up for the pitch of that sentence.

2.  Paragraph two: correct "Each chapter reevaluates literary influence accomplishment"

3.  para 2: which/that confusion in "which influenced these writers" (better to be on the safe side of the sticklers)

4.  para 2: get ride of "the" in "struggles against the environmental determinism"

I would back up Rohan--these things are crapshoots, they're interested in learning how well you fit into their job description. So you need to think, in terms of research, of how many different kinds of things you're interested in. Produce a basic summary of your primary interests, but also an inventory of specific details that you can match to the job description and the specific department/college/university in terms of its strengths and weaknesses. The same with teaching: What sorts of classes would you be able to teach? Willing to teach? Willing to try? This depends on the institution not only in the way you would expect--each institution has certain kinds of teaching needs--but also in an unexpected way. We can distinguish bigger universities--where the courses are often set in stone, and you will need specific expertise to teach them--from liberal arts colleges, where you have much more opportunity to teach outside of your formal expertise.

You might want to hit up the done-ness of your dissertation even harder by including the date filed (month and year) up there in the opener. Also, don't you have some actual publications? Where is your paragraph on your scholarly activity, as shown by recent conferences, publications, and plans for future research projects? (I hated writing the future research "project" blurb the most. Well, writing a statement of teaching philosophy sucks too, its true.) 

And I've heard of tailoring for teaching schools by putting the teaching paragraph up in front of the paragraphs on research/future research/service stuff, but never to put it up first thing of all --- is that really right? Seems kinda stupid --- after all, we just spent a jillion years writing a dissertation and you'd  think they'd at least want a little summary to skim over before they hit your teaching p.

And what's this about having lots of time before your first apps are due? I've been buried under deadlines for a couple weeks now, and they'll all be past by the 15th. Are you doing a really limited search or something? 

PS This damm format makes everybody sound alike. I hate writing job letters!

Can't you refer to an appendix where a lot of this (good) information can be found and stick to your acheivements?

One very quick thing:

_We_ were told that it was intro, two paras on dissertation/book/research, two on teaching, and conclusion. I have no idea whether that actually is standard, and it surely doesn't matter--but to my mind it does indeed make the letter more readable to break those two topics up into two paras apiece rather than just two, total.

I'll join the chorus of people saying the diss paragraph is \*way\* too long.  Someone told me once that a good job letter should leave the committee wanting to learn more.  Indeed, I think that you could get by with a paragraph half as long.  

And, as someone reading files for a search this year, I'd ignore the advice of the person from Penn and only send what the committee asks for.  If we didn't ask for it, I don't even glance at it.  

Best of luck to you!

I have no idea what these things are supposed to look like as I'm a ways out still from having to write one. You got any recently hired friends who will give you theirs that they sent to the places that hired them? 

I don't know how to say this without feeling like a jerk, but I think it bears saying: you sound neat and smart in the letter, Scott, but you're not just neat and smart. You're REALLY neat and REALLY smart, and t least on the blog you come over as passionate about ideas, books, scholarly discussion.... I think the intellectual excitement should come over more. Likewise (or even more so) with teaching. On that note, revise the first sentence of your teaching para, it actually focuses on your research and only shifts to your teach with the weak verb "has informed."

take care,  

Nate
