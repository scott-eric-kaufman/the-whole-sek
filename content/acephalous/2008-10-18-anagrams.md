## "ANAGRAMS!"

I yelled, in a manner typically reserved for "EUREKA!"  Why all the yelling?  Because at long last I'd discovered why I despise the word "blog."  

It's an anagram of "glob."  How can something that's anagrammatic kin to "a mass or lump of some liquid or semi-liquid substance" be valuable?  

That I didn't realize this sooner is an embarrassment.  I am, after all, a [cybernetic Shakespeare](http://www.playfish.com/?page=game\_wordchallenge).  (Challenge me at your own risk.)

[Trying again because comment rejected.]

Check out the list of things there are globs of in a Google search for "glob of".  Strangely enough, the thing that I thought was going to be the number one hit wasn't there.

The word "blog" is OK because of constant use, I suppose, but when you think of its stated etymology, you have to sneer at the people who thought it up.  'Hey, let's name our online journal a "Web log".  That's so cool!  But you know what's even cooler?  We'll shorten it to "'blog".  Yeah, just one word, blog!  That's the best -- having our own special Internet slang makes us feel so in-group, so with-it, just like LOL.  There's nothing cooler than LOL.  Until blog.  And we can make it into a verb, and an adjective, and maybe even a preposition!  Or something.  Even an article.  So that if you were going to write "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" you could instead write "Blog blog blog blog blogged over blog blog blog."  This is the best new word ever!'

One of my favorite toys is the Internet Anagram Server:  [http://wordsmith.org/anagram/](http://wordsmith.org/anagram/)

I used it to re-name my dissertation committee!
