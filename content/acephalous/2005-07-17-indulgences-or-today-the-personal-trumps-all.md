## Indulgences; or, Today The Personal Trumps All

I speak about personal matters so frequently here I don't even have a category for it.  So I suppose "Shameless Self-Promotion" must suffice, though I'm not really promoting anything.  Nor am I not promoting it shamelessly.  But here goes:

On this day, July 17th, six years ago, Mr. A. Cephalous and Mrs. Little Womedievalist became Mr. and Mrs. A. Cephalous for the first time.  To please the Mr.'s father, they did it a second time a month later.  Only Jewishly.  

(That's right: I've been married for six years and am barely in spitting distance of thirty.  What can I say?  She's from Mississippi; I'm from Louisiana.  We consider ourselves lucky we didn't marry kin.)

Congratulations! And good job not marrying your 'kin'. Love, trust, and genetic diversity are the pillars of a successful relationship.

Congratulations!  Joanne and I just celebrated our third two weeks ago.  That genetic diversity doesn't mean that you two will be producing mini-acephali any time soon, though?  Right?

You're from Louisiana? How did that happen?

Oh, and congrats.

Amardeep, they let four us leave every year, to witness to the nation the joys that are Cajun food, LSU football and good ol' fashioned Southern bigotry.
