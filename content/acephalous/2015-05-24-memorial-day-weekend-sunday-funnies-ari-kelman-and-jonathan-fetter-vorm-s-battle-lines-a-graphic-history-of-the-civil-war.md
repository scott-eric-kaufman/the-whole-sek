You can read [the whole thing here](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/%!E(MISSING)2%9Cbattle\_lines\_a\_graphic\_history\_of\_the\_civil\_war%!E(MISSING)2%9D\_uses\_vivid\_art\_to\_tell\_the\_story\_of\_americas\_darkest\_war/), but here's a taste: 

“[Battle Lines: A Graphic History of the Civil War](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809094746/diesekoschmar-20)” is a remarkable achievement both as a work of history and visual literature, providing a broad overview of the complex circumstances that gave rise to the bloodiest conflict in American history, while simultaneously making those deaths meaningful by capturing fleeting moments amid the slaughter in panels so beautifully wrought as to beggar description.

The book is a collaboration by Penn State historian Ari Kelman, who won the 2014 Bancroft Prize for “[A Misplaced Massacre](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674045858/diesekoschmar-20),” about the unecessary 1864 slaughter of the Cheyenne at Sand Creek, and Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, whose 2012 graphic novel “[Trinity](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809093553/diesekoschmar-20)” worked as both a detailed history of the building of the first atomic bomb and a philosophical meditation on its impact on humanity.

In short, it would be difficult to imagine a creative team better suited to capturing the tragic magnitude of the Civil War on an intimate and harrowing scale. Its engagement with actual history is on par with Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon’s engagement with fictional history in “[Watchmen](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401238963/diesekoschmar-20).”

If I still [taught visual rhetoric](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/02/scott-eric-kaufmans-visual-rhetoric-compendium-as-of-11282011.html), I could easily see pairing the two books and discussing the way in which, for example, Kelman’s stunningly concise summaries of the troop movements and Washington politics impact the reader’s experience of the pages that immediately follow.

Consider, for example, what Kelman told me was his favorite sequence in the book, which begins with an update on the war’s progress via an ersatz edition of the Harrisburg Bulletin...
