...[Boris Karloff](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/069452476X/qid=1117478037/sr=8-2/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i2\_xgl14/102-9607103-5071311?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)?  According to the blurb, 
Although Boris Karloff is best known in the Unites States for his
horror film roles, he was a classically trained actor with a
distinguished stage and film career. His voice and articulation are
perfect for these tales: soothing and emotive, suspenseful at just the
right places. A 6-year-old listener was as captivated as the reviewer...

A six-year old "captivated" by Boris Karloff.  I think I've seen this [one](http://imdb.com/title/tt0031951/) before.  And am I the only person having a hard time imagining Karloff as the narrator of the 1966 television version of [_How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0060345/) or does this belong in the category of pop-culture trivia everybody else digested long ago?  

(And before anyone asks, I'm hard at work dissertating.  I amazoned--if one can "google," one can "amazon" and also probably "imdb," although we'll probably need a new class of phonemes to pronounce that puppy--the Kipling because I'm tired [as are my eyes] of staring at the just-crisp-enough-to-read but blurry-enough-to-suspect-I-need-new-glasses .pdf of the originals in _Ladies Home Journal_.)
