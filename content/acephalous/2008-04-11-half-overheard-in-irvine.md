Via a student and her cell phone:
I h_aaaaaaaaa_te philosophy.

(_listens_)

So before class he grabbed me and said he wanted to talk about my paper later.  So I was all, alright, you know, and I went to his office after class and waited for like _ten minutes_ and finally he showed up.

(_listens_)

So anyway, I went in and he was like, "Did you do the reading for the paper?"  I was like, "I haven't missed a class."  Then he was like, "I know, but can you tell me about your argument?"  

(_listens_)

Exactly, like I would need to plagiarize.  So I was all, "My paper's about Being in the World and revelations."  Then he was like, "That's what I want to talk to you about."  So I'm like, "I can tell you my argument in specific if you don't believe."

(_listens_)

So now get this, then he was like, "I don't think you copied someone's work, but I'm concerned you're not doing yours."  So I said, "I come to every class and pay attention and take lots of notes," and then he was about to say something else so I said, "I even remember my thesis, you know, about how Heidegger is on about stuff like the World and intelligent **_design_** and—"

(_listens_)

I h_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa_te philosophy.

For some reason, this reminded me of [this](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/05/18/the-vagina-dialogues/).

We demand documentation.

It's a familiar conversation, actually: students think that college is like high school, and attendance is enough. It takes time for some of them to realize (some get it right away, some never do) that there's a new level of intellectual independence required, and just listening to the teacher without seriously engaging  the readings isn't going to cut it. (Unless you're in the classes of some of my colleagues, who apparently tell students everything they "need" to know about the books so nobody has to read them. Silly me: I've been assigning books and expecting students to actually use them....)

I think I would have hated philosophy too if I had had to read Heidegger as an undergrad.  Clearly this girl is not a philosophy major.  Why is she being asked to slog through him in an intro-level class?  Thank god my intro to philosophy syllabus stuck to Plato, Augustine, Descartes, and Hume.  

Which isn't to say this girl isn't aaaannoying.  Then again, I don't understand what this professor is trying to get out of her.

My brother is always telling me that certain people - the elderly, the infirm, the stupid, television journalists, centrists - should be liquefied and packed into the polar ice caps to roll back the danger from global warming. When I get off the phone with him I like to bring myself back up a bit, get a little sunny optimism by touring the blogosphere. Works great usually.

Not today!

Dude, Heidegger rocks--and is much easier to read in English than in German (and German is my native tongue!).  

That conversation, though?  Ties my stomach into a knot.  I wonder what they teach kids in high school here (or do I even really want to know?) ...

You mean there are places where they TEACH kids in high school? Go figure.
