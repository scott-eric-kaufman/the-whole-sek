## Some times I feel sorry for the high school coach who cut Michael Jordan from the JV squad because, quote, "He would never cut it on varsity."

Others, I laugh at anonymous reviewers of such limited imagination their predictions have become Monuments of Wrongness.  [To wit](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9405EFD71331E033A25752C0A9679C94629ED7CF):

Hume's predictions on who'll be remembered in philosophy:  

"This also must be confessed, that the most durable, as well as justest fame, has been acquired by the easy philosophy, and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation, from the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have not been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity. ... The fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is utterly decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation: but the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his own age. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke shall be entirely forgotten."

Zero for three.
