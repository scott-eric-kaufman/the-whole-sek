This week’s episode of _The Walking Dead_, “Internment,” may well have been the strongest in what’s shaping up to be the strongest season to date. It was directed by [David Boyd](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/11/11/the-walking-dead-we-all-die-alone-broken-and-afraid/www.imdb.com/name/nm0101741/),
  one of the most talented men you’ve never heard of. He’s been the  
director of photography on such visually uninspiring fare as _Firefly_ and _Deadwood_, so it should be no surprise that the composition and shot selection in “Internment” was barely this side of breathtaking.

What do I mean?

For  one, Boyd’s use of close-ups in this episode weren’t used to 
cheaply  intensify scenes whose dialogue lacked emotional impact. Unlike, say, the opening credit sequence of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_, which closes in [to bring the pain](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/what-will-become-of-the-children-why-theyll-be-raped-and-murdered-of-course)
 and reassure you that the police always have your best interest at  
heart, the close-ups in “Internment” function as the necessary  
conclusions to terrible arguments.

Consider, for example, this close-up of Rick’s gun:

It’s the culmination of the should-he-or-shouldn’t-he-pick-up-arms  
subplot, but instead of having Rick say something about it, Boyd just  
places Rick’s gun in-frame and lets it speak for itself. Note, though,  
that the gun’s slightly off-center, a screen-position people have been  
trained by Hollywood to hate.

The audience, then, is primed for something to happen — and  
conventionally, that “something” would be that the camera shifts to the 
 left and “properly” frames the gun, dead-center, since it’s the most  
important element in the shot.

Boyd knows that’s the expectation — he knows that his audience [craves symmetry in its compositions](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/03/mad-men-a-little-kiss.html) — but instead of conceding to audience expectations, he recapitulates the should-he-or-shouldn’t-he argument:

When Rick’s pea-bearing hand enters the frame, Boyd [racks the focus](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#53908),
  shifting the emphasis from the arms he just took up to the green 
thumbs  he put them down for. In a single shot, then, Boyd’s reminded 
the  audience of the Big Decision Rick had to make, but he did so 
without  having to use dialogue as a crutch, as the show so often has. 
What could  have been a tossed off transition between scenes in which 
characters  indulge in unnecessary expository monologues is, instead, a 
seemingly  tossed-off reminder of past soul-searching.
