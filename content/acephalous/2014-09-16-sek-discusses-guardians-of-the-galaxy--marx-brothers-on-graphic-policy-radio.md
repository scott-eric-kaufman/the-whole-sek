If you're interested in what I have to say about _Guardians of the Galaxy_, I was a guest on Graphic Policy Radio radio talking about it last night.

I made a number of claims about the film, foremost among them its indebtedness to mid-period Marx Brothers films.

I also said quite about something I kept calling "old-school sci-fi wonder" -- though I have no idea why I became so wedded to that phrase -- and _Parks and Rec_, because anytime I have the opportunity to discuss _Parks and Rec_, I will.

**UPDATE:** I forgot many of the interesting tangents we went on, _e.g._ What would a science fiction film that wasn't anthropocentric actually look like, and would it ever get made? (For example, can you imagine a film version of an Iain M. Banks novel?)

**AND ALSO:** All of the "Bert Macklin, FBI" stuff on _Parks and Rec_ -- his deep commitment to his flights of fancy -- always reminded me of what Calvin from _Calvin and Hobbes_ would've grown up to be like, so _Guardians of the Galaxy_ struck me like a "Spaceman Spiff" serial.
