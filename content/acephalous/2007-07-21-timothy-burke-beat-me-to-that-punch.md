I'd half-written a post damn near identical to Timothy's [latest](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=402), but now I can't publish it for fear of seeming derivative.  (Not that I'm frequently not.)  One of the comforts of not blogging on the cusp of popular culture is never having to worry about being usurped ... or so I thought until tonight.
