In case you're counting, that would be two typical entries and a billion-zillion of this odd new breed.  I'm closing comments on older posts and CAPTCHA will be in effect until these useless waves stop crashing.  I apologize for the inconvenience.

I don't know what's worse, the right-wing spam or the left-wing concern trolling you get at EOTAW. I have a kind of golden rule of commenting: anything I'd consider inane or unwelcome at my own blog, I try not to perpetrate on others. And since my blogging ethic is to blog about whatever I damn well please, I haven't a leg to stand on with regard to how other bloggers spend their time. None of us do, really.

I kind of want to know about "non revolution substantial contribute points capacity," though.
