## Because I'm a Stylist Pure

After compressing 133 pages into 34, then 29, I felt drained.  After expanding 29 into 37, then 43, I teetered on the edge of exhaustion.  Now I've condensed 43 into 32 and the light is fading from my eyes.  Fortunately, all I need to do is one more edit—longhand, in red, without mercy—and I will be finished with it.  _For now_.

I've written an angry, verbose post concerning the conflicting demands of historicism and the dissertation, but I'm placing it in my back pocket for the time being, as I lack proper distance from my frustration to be even remotely objective.  In its stead, I present the following passage from Tom Masson's parodic play, _The Toilers_ (1901), in which Henry James lays claim to his greatness:

(_A HERALD approaches, bearing a combination flagstaff, with the English and American flags waving together, and after him, clad in a costume of pure white, steps HENRY JAMES_)

SONG OF MYSELF.  HENRY JAMES

I'm a solemn sight  
In my robe of white,   
     Which all of you must endure—  
Though you secretly sigh  
And wonder why—  
     Because I'm a stylist pure.

My sentences long  
I twist with a strong  
     Right arm that is safe and sure,  
And commas I cram  
Where the sense they'll dam,  
     For I am a stylist pure.

My plots are dull  
And unbeautiful—  
     Insomnia they will cure;  
But the cultured few  
Say I'm an artist true  
     Because I am a stylist pure.

(_He trips calmly to right and left, performing a modest and stately skirt dance, and concludes_)

I'm a stylist pure whom you all endure for  
     the sake of the cultured few,  
Who hysterically sigh and raise an eye,  
     and exclaim he's an artists ture!"  
Which, as every one knows who is fond of a   
     pose, is the elegant thing to do.

CHORUS

For he is a stylist pure  
Whom all of us must endure,  
     Because of the few,  
Who are cultured and true,  
Proclaim it's the thing to do.

If you think _that_ is cruel, you should see the tripe Silas Weir Mitchell spouts.

I'm ... thinking of reading Henry James' _The Sacred Fount_. Think I should do it?

Depends.  Have you ever read James before?  To my mind, the best place to start are with the mid-period stories, collected [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883011647/diesekoschmar-20).  Not too much of a commitment, but capture the Jamesian style before it becomes overly ornate.  A warning, though: I'm not a fan of late James, which, to my ears, bears the marks of its dictation.  So, as you might expect, I'm a fan of the mid-period novels, too, my favorite being [_The Princess Casimassima_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/014043254X/diesekoschmar-20).  The latest one I was somehow able to enjoy was _Wings of the Dove_, so technically, _The Sacred Fount_ shouldn't be all that bad; but I remember not liking it that much.  Others will, no doubt, disagree.

Thank you for the suggestions, I've read _Daisy Miller_ and remembered being annoyed by how precious and, as you put it, ornate the whole story was; however the aforementioned book and _The Ambassadors_ seem like prime candidates for some careful reading in my case, provided I don't fall asleep or stare at the page thinking of how many ways I can kill a man. These things happen.

_The Sacred Fount_ is James's craziest book, and definitely in The Late Style. I love it, but if you thought _Daisy Miller_ was too ornate, you might not share my response.
