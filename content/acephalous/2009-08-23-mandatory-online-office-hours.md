			**SEK:** It looks like everyone is here.  How about we begin by introducing ourselves.  I'll start: Hi, I'm Scott, and I grade your things.

**princesshotpantz:** I'm Sally and you probably hate grading my things.

**SEK:** I don't discriminate: I hate grading all things.

**chompchompchomp:** i'm pho and i just woke up five minutes ago to join this chat

**WrAtHyKhAn:** I'm Lou and I hate writing things.

**chompchompchomp:** seems like we're all in agreement we hating writing and you hate grading so we shouldn't write anything for this class

**SEK:** I suppose you think I should just give you all A's too.

**princesshotpantz:** No . . . maybe B's.

**WrAtHyKhAn:** We can pick any topic?

**SEK:** So you don't want to write anything, but you want to start writing it now?  I see.

**princesshotpantz:** I just need more guidance on my topic so I can start thinking about writing.  I like the discussion in Chapter 2 so far though.

**SEK:** So you like Chapter 2.  If you want to write on the topics discussed there, where should you look?

**chompchompchomp:** foottoes

**SEK:** Are connected to the . . . ?

**WrAtHyKhAn:** Ankle bones.

**chompchompchomp:** \*footnoses

**SEK:** Now you're doing it on purpose.

**chompchompchomp:** \*footNOTES 

**chompchompchomp:** sorry just woke up

**princesshotpantz:** So I should look at the footnotes?

**SEK:** That's where the citations live.

**WrAtHyKhAn:** Is it dumb that I want to do a little research before I actually choose my topic?

**SEK:** Not at all.  That is, in fact, what I'm trying to trick you into doing.

**SEK:** Did I type that out loud?

**WrAtHyKhAn:** Your jig is up.

**princesshotpantz:** Don't jig up Scott.  He's the one who grades our stuff.

**SEK:** Are you still with us Lou?

**SEK:** I know you're in here.

**SEK:** I CAN SEE YOU TYPING!

**chompchompchomp:** yeah my bad i'm thinking

**SEK:** Thinking's your good, not your bad.  I just wanted to make sure you weren't dead.

**chompchompchomp:** i'm thinking for a question but then i got shot.  seems i am dead.

**SEK:** NO ONE DIES ON MY WATCH!

**princesshotpantz:** Where should we find those articles from the footnotes?

**SEK:** I'll give you a hint: those library tutorials weren't busywork.

**chompchompchomp:** the library website!

**SEK:** Someone is finally awake and has his head in the game.

**chompchompchomp:** &gt;&lt;

**SEK:** Are you tweaking now Lou?

**chompchompchomp:** wait . . .

**chompchompchomp:** tweaking?

**chompchompchomp:** are you saying what I think you're saying?

**SEK:** South Park.  [Tweek](http://redxdress.blog.friendster.com/files/tweek.jpg).  Too much caffeine: &gt;&lt;

**chompchompchomp:** then maybe i am tweaking. i don't know south park tweaking though.

**princesshotpantz:** Can anyone answer these questions or are you asking a specific person about the library?

**SEK:** Anyone can answer any time. 

**SEK:** It's a party!

**SEK:** So what does Ben-Shahar mean by flow?

**SEK:** Feel free to answer any day now.

**SEK:** You people type like old people.

**chompchompchomp:** like old people what?

**SEK:** Simmer down now. What are you people doing anyway?

**princesshotpantz:** "Flow is a state in which one is immersed in an experience that is rewarding in and of itself."

**chompchompchomp:** i was just about to type that

**SEK:** Paraphrase is your friend.  Otherwise we'll be here all day and we've already lost Lou again.

**WrAtHyKhAn:** Sorry.  I was over here not flowing.

**SEK:** Why aren't you flowing?

**WrAtHyKhAn:** Talking about flowing doesn't make me flow.

**SEK:** What does make you flow?

**WrAtHyKhAn:** Video games.

**SEK:** I'm sure there has been academic research on why and how people enjoy video games.

**chompchompchomp:** you should talk to fatal1ty.

**WrAtHyKhAn:** I shall google that.

**SEK:** Or you could consult the library.

**chompchompchomp:** fatal1ty won't be in the library.

**SEK:** Shut up n00b.

**chompchompchomp:** exactly

**SEK:** I mean EXACTLY.

**princesshotpantz:** So what time will Roy be getting here?

**SEK:** Roy?  Who's Roy?

**chompchompchomp:** not i

**princesshotpantz:** Sorry sorry wrong window.

**SEK:** Are you cheating on us with another online office hours?

**WrAtHyKhAn:** I feel used.

**chompchompchomp:** don't worry scott we still love you.

**princesshotpantz:** I do too!  Sorry sorry sorry.  I'm here now again 100 percent and ready to flow!

**SEK:** We talked while you were off with Roy and decided that we'll forgive you just this once.  Cheat on us with other online office hours again and . . . how about we get back to the topic at hand?

What form of chat are you using? One of the LMS's?

I'm old-fashioned. I'm making them email me in the first week!

It's just plain old AIM.  The thing is, this is an online course, so this is the bulk of my interaction with the students outside of grading.  It's not perfect, but it sorta kinda works.  The main problem I've encountered is how easy it is for them to get side-tracked---basically the only way to get them back on track is to remind them that they're being grading, lest they spend the entire chat rehashing the PC/Mac debate.

And what will your students think when they learn their professor is a douchebag who posted their chat verbatim on the internet for everyone to in the world to mock?  Will they report you?  I would.

And who lets his students get away with attributing Czikszentmihalyi's definition to Ben Shahar?

Vance, Ben-Shahar discusses Czikszentmihalyi at length, so all is cool.  

BJTexarkana, no actual students are ever hurt during the making a post.
