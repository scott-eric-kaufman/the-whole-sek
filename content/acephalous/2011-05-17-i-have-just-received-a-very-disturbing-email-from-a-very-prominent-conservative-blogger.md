...who informs me that my "true" identity is 
Batman
 _John Casper_.  I kid you not: I'm now accused of being [the very same John Casper who, a few years ago, tried to destroy my academic career](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/update\_on\_the\_s.html).  I'm not currently privy to the "evidence" against "me," but I look forward to confronting it with great gusto, if only to have the opportunity to reprint [this letter from an African-American scholar](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/update\_africana.html), because I enjoy white-hot displays of scorn as much as the next historian.

I've got a tremendously busy week ahead of me, so please feel free to update me about future "developments" in comments, via email, or through Facebook. Because this should be entertaining.  

**UPDATE:** As far as anyone can tell, something like [this](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/05/this-is-how-jews-work-we-say-i-am-who-i-am-and-we-mean-it/comment-page-1#comment-119810) or [this](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/05/this-is-how-jews-work-we-say-i-am-who-i-am-and-we-mean-it/comment-page-1#comment-120211) happened. What either or those things may be, your guess is as good as mine.

As you well know, those words have left my mouth and met with much rape-stopping success in the past, so in some small way, I'll always be _a_ Batman ... but I can't lay claim to the definite article.  (Though with the advent of _[Batman Inc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\_Incorporated)_, that may not even be an issue.)

Maybe it's the set up for a misguided compliment, in which he then tells you he is your father.

And hold on a minute, I've been telling people your real name was Nate Hawthorne --

so, you are the third blogger to say they have been accused of being someone they are not this week. I wish you guys would ID your accuser so we could know if it is the same moran hoping to get one hit so they can claim fame or just yet another wingnut whackoff fest.

Can I be John Casper too? And can we get Meade to do an interview? I can by a phone app to change my voice, to be mysterious, in that makes the prospect more appealing. 

... Oh. You said "prominent". It must be Donalde.

Apparently someone was shamed, most likely after a legal reminder of his school's code of ethics, into not revealing that I'm exactly who I claim to be.

SEK apparently wishes not to name his prominent conservative accuser. I think we should all respect that decision, and I hope I am not acting outside its bounds when I say that, whilst I will not mention the name of my lead candidate, I do note her fondness for hypocrisy, box wines and late-middle-age marriage to mental midgets.

Mrs T, at the risk of compromising the vow SEK has taken, that blogger in question does not self-identify as "conservative".

If it's the one I believe it might be, then SEK's conclusion is not impossible. And that is all I will say on the subject.

Adding to Actor's guesswork, I can think of a blogger who is, shall we say, obsessed with both SEK and the name Casper.

_you are the third blogger to say they have been accused of being someone they are not this week._ 

And, just to be absolutely honest, I wasn't being accused of being someone I'm _not_, but of being _me_.  I imagine the sentence, which I haven't seen and hasn't been deleted from Google Cache by anyone, likely said something like "I have discovered that the prominent liberal blogger who writes under the pseudonym 'Acephalous' is, in fact, the same Scott Eric Kaufman who teaches composition at UC Irvine."  Hence, the hilarity.

**SEE THE UPDATE:** No sane person has any clue what just happened, and I have papers to grade.

As a Casper (not THAT Casper, but a Casper nevertheless) I sincerely apologize for the asshole Casper who once tried to do you in. But seeing as how you are now me--and we are all apparently Tintin--I assume I forgive myself my trespasses against me, or whatever...

Wow. I feel much better now, and I hope I do, too.

(To be clear; repsac's the pseudonym. Casper (James, not John) is the actual, familial, surname nym. Boo.)

SEK, I dropped you a note at S,N! re: this issue.

Donalde? If you're reading...and you know you are...I also posted something ten years ago about a true child pornographer. Please feel free to go look up my old job and then you can accuse a German photographer, a Canadian magazine editor and a world famous rock star (blogging under a pseudonym) of being me, too. 

Mmmmmmk?
