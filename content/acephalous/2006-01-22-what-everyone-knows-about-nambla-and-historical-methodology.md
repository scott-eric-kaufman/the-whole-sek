## What "Everyone Knows" About NAMBLA and Historical Methodology

[_X-posted to [the Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/)._]

Reading through the complete ([online](http://www.benoitlewis.com/content.php4?page=portfolio&n=2&h=2&f=2)) works of the handsome [Benoit Denizet-Lewis](http://www.benoitlewis.com/public/images/benoit\_photo2.jpg), I found the following paragraph ([warning](http://nogreatmatter.blogspot.com/2006/01/way-we-read-now.html): long) on the [North America Man/Boy Love Association](http://216.220.97.17/): 
Curley family attorney Larry Frisoli flatly compares NAMBLA to the Mafia. "NAMBLA is a criminal organization that teaches its members how to rape kids," he says in a conversation in his Cambridge office. "To say that age-of-consent laws should be changed is fine; it's legal. But to actually encourage and assist in the abuse of children is illegal. If you look at [_The Godfather_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=blended%!k(MISSING)eyword=The%!G(MISSING)odfather)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), in the '40s and '50s, the Corleones always got up there and said, 'We don't exist.' Yet they did exist. And NAMBLA does exist. And it has tiers of membership. And like the Mafia, the question becomes how much can you blame the Godfather for what the foot soldier on the street is doing?"

The evidentiary standards set by Curley family attorney Larry Frisoli lack a little something in the substance department.  To prove that a conspiracy of pedophiles exists in the face of overwhelming evidence that it doesn't, Frisoli compares it to the _fictional_ counterpart of _[La Cosa Nostra](http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/lcn/lcn.htm)._ One could say that this tactic works on the analogical level because "everyone knows" that Puzo based the Corleone family on LCN. 

But shouldn't what "everyone knows" be based on fact instead of fictionalization?  Shouldn't the Curley's attorney appeal to the inner-workings of LCN instead of what Puzo imagined them to be?  Otherwise Frisoli transfers to what he believes an actual conspiracy the attributes of Puzo's fictional one.  The oversimplification involved in such a move isn't merely explanatory either.  Unlike a scientific analogy intended to communicate the complexity of a process by baby steps, Frisoli's analogy is an end unto itself.  No further learning involved: 

If NAMBLA is structured like _La Cosa Nostra_, then it is a criminal conspiracy.  Frisoli invokes _The Godfather_ not to explain the workings of a more complex network but to explain away the complexities of any bureaucratic organization . . . by pointing to an imaginary one in which all actions are intentional and all consequences the result of premeditation.  "Everyone knows" that Michael Corleone is responsible for the infamous Baptismal Bloodbath.  Thus "everyone knows" that all pederasts intend to kill the likes of [Jeffrey Curley](http://www.prospect.org/print/V11/24/kaminer-w.html).  From analogy to intention to conviction via a single fictional leap. 

As much as this particular analogy bothers me—and lest I be misunderstood by those who could only want to misunderstand me, I'm not defending Curley's murderers nor NAMBLA here—what bothers me more is the insistence on the logic of what "everyone knows."  Because not "everyone knows" all that much about anything.  At least that's what it seems like today.  But irony of ironies:

My dissertation is predicated on the notion that there are some things that "everyone knows" and that these things are so pervasive they appear in almost all the literary and popular writing of the period.  So when reading a surprisingly (given their its and general approach) [thorough and convincing historical work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0618551166)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) I shouldn't stumble choke die on sentences like:
Whether or not Lincoln read this article . . . he couldn't have avoided such a widespread and commonly accepted argument.

Because he could have.  I do it all the time.  I avoid common arguments because what "everyone knows" to be true often isn't . . . and yet when I write about historical moments I try to inhabit a notion of what constitutes the norm in ways that I find laughable when applied to contemporary culture.  Like Frisoli's application up there.  How different is his assessment of the impact of _The Godfather_ from the average historicist's assessment of the popularity of say some Jack London novel?  No matter how informed the reading it is liable to fail many tests many times for many reasons.  I'm not sure I like that but I don't see many alternatives.  If we recreate the past to fit our image of it again and again and again then how are we better than the New Dealers who invented Social Darwinism to justify their policies?

Being a sranger here (probably having arrived via the King Kong thread), I presume I'm missing large chunks of the basis -- the things everyone knows, in fact -- for a lot of what's being discussed. I can accept that; but this is peculiarly mystifying:

"the New Dealers who invented Social Darwinism to justify their policies"

I suppose their policies are not being characterized here as social-darwinistic, but rather as having been politically defended as a counter to s.d. Or maybe I've even got that part wrong? 

But in what sense was the New Deal inventing a position that had been widespread since before the turn of the century? When poor old William Jennings Bryan turned from defending workers and farmers to battling Evil-lution, he was (according to one narrative that seems credible) in reaction against Social Darwinism; he just messed up disastrously in his analysis of where the problem was. 

(BTW the OED's citation for social Darwinism from 1887 does not make it entirely clear whether anyone else was using the term at that time; but the 1907 citation is a reference to others' use of the phrase. It would be interesting to know whether, as that quotation implies, the term was coined by the opponents of social darwinism and not by Haeckel and that crowd who advocated the idea.)

So, returning to the point, what is it that the New Dealers invented in this connection? Perhaps the idea that s.d. was widespread and dangerous? Is the contention that in reality it was just a fringe notion?

You're about to get a condensed version of Acephalous' dissertation, Porlock.

Porlock Jr., as Stephen said, you've stepped into dissertation territory . . . but instead of condensing my dissertation, I'll address the questions you asked directly and hope I don't bore you with too much detail.  That 1907 citation in the OED is the best place to start.  It's from [this article](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9602%!(NOVERB)
