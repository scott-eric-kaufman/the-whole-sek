Obama, Biden, and Pelosi all had three distinct facial reactions to Wilson; three reactions I have seen elsewhere, specifically, in high school, when someone shouted something akin to "Penis!" at an assembly. Biden had the, "I am embarrassed for the whole school" look; Pelosi had the "Who said that! If I find out who said that they are in detention for a week! Two!" look; and Obama had the "I hate high schoolers. I hate them, but someone's got to get them ready for college, right?" look.

As opposed to the 8, no make that 9 years, no make that almost 10 years of anti-bush years consisting of the highest form of decorum?

Pray, Douglas, what is "the highest form of decorum"?  Bowing extra low?  Extending the pinky finger when sipping tea?  Or is it some aphorism—like "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"—that I'm unfamiliar with?

I don't really care about the Joe Wilson flap, but I'll note that Wilson is not Kos—that is, some shmoe being rude to Obama on his website, as Kos and Atrios were rude to Bush.  He's not Michael Moore, either.  He's a US Congressman, and he yelled what he yelled during an official address by the President.  Again, I really don't care, but the two sides don't match up.  Unless you have an example of a Democratic Congressperson doing something equivalent during the Bush years…?

Also, er, Wilson was demonstrably and undeniably _wrong_.
