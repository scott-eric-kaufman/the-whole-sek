Typepad tonight insists on dancing up and down, so I don't feel comfortable inscribing my hardy howlings in its boxes.  Instead I copy this doggerel copped and forwarded by mine beloved:

				withLeefen I her on tha morrow  
Drawen to memorie wolde I be?  
Fore wenden I moot be, anon,  
For sith tha bene so greet londes moot I sey.  
But, if bileven her wytht ye, mayde,  
Thyngis coldna bene algates.  
For sith anon I be quit as ane foule,  
And this foule ye conna chaunge.  
Tha Lorde konne, I conna chaunge.

If Skynyrd do not for ye, tha Lord konne ye love [Shaft](http://imdb.com/title/tt0067741/):
Wha be tha blake prevy lawe  
That bene wantoun too alle tha feres?  
Shaft!  
Ya damne righte!

Wha be tha carl tha riske is hals wolt  
Fro is allye leve?  
Shaft!  
Konne ye?

Wha be tha carl wha ne wolden flee  
Whan peril bene all aboughte?  
Shaft!  
Verray!

Alle clepe tha carl ane badde mooder-  
Softe!  
Speken of Shaft bene I.  
Than konne alles we!

He be a man konne unnethes  
Namo save is mayde konnes im.  
JOHN SHAFT!

This warbled blasphemy brought to ye by the wife and the venerable [Geoff Chaucer](http://www.livejournal.com/users/geoff\_chaucer/). 
Were I not too annoyed with Typepad to write words of value I would
best this Chaucer at his own game.  For tonight, I defer to the whims
of technological failures and promise my beloved audience a Wakean
"Dust in the Wind" come tha morrow.

Corrected!  But Ben, do you respect me more, or less, because I made that error.  As a Southerner I know I should be ashamed, but I can't help but think there's nothing wrong with not being able to spell the name of the band that soundtracked your beatings...

Sigh... and to think, one of the more entertaining posts you have posted (at least in subject matter) only elicits one short comment. Where are your medievaly-readerists?!
