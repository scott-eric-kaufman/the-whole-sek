## Pynchon Then & Now...

... as illustrated on pages 52 and 53 of _Against the Day_.  First, the clumsy integration of Turner's "frontier thesis" into the body of the text:
"It may not be the West you're expecting," Professor Vanderjuice put in.  "Back in July my colleague Freddie Turner came out here from Harvard and gave a speech before the a bunch of anthro people who were all in town for their convention and of course the Fair.  To the effect that the Western frontier we all thought we knew from song and story was no longer on the map but gone, absorbed—a dead duck."

Perhaps the clunkiness of that passage is mitigated by the fact that a haughty professor mumbles it.  Maybe Pynchon intended its clumsiness; maybe he wanted to indict academia by having its functionaries speak a dead language to unlistening ears.  But turn to the next page:
"Yes, here," continued the Professor, nodding down at the [slaughter] Yards as they began to flow by beneath, "here's where the Trail comes to its end at last, along with the American Cowboy who used to live on it and by it.  No matter how virtuous he's kept his name, how many evildoers he's managed to get by undamaged, how he's done by his horses, what girls he has chastely kissed, serenaded by guitar, or gone out and raised halleujah with, it's all back there in the traildust now and now of it matters, for down there you'll find the wet convergence and finale of his drought-struck tale and thankless calling, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show stood on its head—spectators invisible and silent, nothing to be commemorated, the only weapons in view being Blitz Instruments and Wackett Punches to knock animals out with, along with the blades everybody is packing, of course, and the rodeo clowns jabber on in some incomprehensible lingo not to distract the beast but rather to heighten and maintain its attention to the single task at hand, bringing it down to those last few gates, the stunning-devices waiting inside, the butchering and blood just beyond the last chute—and the cowboy with him."

In that second paragraph, the Professor sounds like someone from a Pynchon novel—more to the point, he sounds like _the narrator_ of a Pynchon novel.  Not to dredge up [old animosities](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on\_terrible\_neo.html), but more and more Pynchon seems burdened by his distinctive voice.  

When his characters speak in their own voices, they sound like the stilted hack-work of an imitator; when they speak in his voice, they rise to Pynchonian heights, but they do so at the cost of being recognizable characters.  In _Gravity's Rainbow_, Pynchon was better able to strike a balance.  

It has taken me four months to publish this post, as I'm annoyed by my own reaction to [_Against the Day_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159420120X/diesekoschmar-20).  Unlike every other Pynchon novel I've read, when I finished _Against the Day_, I was finished__with it.  Haven't thought about it since.  

As you can tell, I am sad.

Oh no! Will my patient waiting for a paperback Pynchon be all for naught? 

I remember being kinda unimpressed with the voices and speech styles of the characters in Vineland at the time, too, but what stays in the mind this much later are the hilarious and strange descriptions of events, so I have a vague glow of well-meaning toward that book.

What did you think of Mason & Dixon in terms of the voices? Were the strange 18th-C typographical tics enough to justify their dialogue in your mind? 

It's been a long time since I revisited Pynchon. I wonder if I have progressed past my first crush. 

In other excessive Faulknerian sentence news, I just got a new Cormac McCarthy book. Since I have to be in a nondepressive mood to read him, though, it will be a while before I actually tackle it.

Two hundred pages left -- and they've been left since the beginning of February.  I know I'll finish eventually, but I'm in no hurry, in part because I know the ending won't really "do" anything: you can't tie up what's not hanging in any interesting way.

The novel feels "underwritten," undercooked, to use Peter Elbow's term.  In too many places, it's like a hastily written outline of a Pynchon novel.  (Much like Morrison's \*Love\* was a hastily written skeleton of a Morrison novel -- which it was, because her publishers forced her to get it out before she was finished with it.)  

It's sad to me not only because I love Pynchon's work.  It's sad because this should have been his best novel.  The historical material is far richer, and the plot lines -- Western vengeance novel lingering after the death of the frontier; Victorian boys adventure story lingering after the death of Victorian optimism; anarchist espionage novel about to be swallowed up in the real chaos of world war; novel of mathematical ideas about to be swallowed up by Einsteinian physics -- could have continued Pynchon's rethinking of globalization started in \*Mason & Dixon\*.  The Chicago World's Fair itself should have presented him with enough rich material to fill a novel -- Christ, Chris Ware did a far better job with that stuff.  Pabst's Blue Ribbon won the damned blue ribbon there!  Juicy Fruit started there!

(The issue of narrative voice Scott raises is more complex, in part because there are several narrative voices in this novel.  The perky Victorian boys novelist; the salty Western voice; the Conradian espionage voice.  All of Pynchon's novels have characters who speak in "his" voice -- the feng shui master in \*M&D\* and DL's "mother superior" at the ninja retreat come to mind.  And I read Pynchon for that voice, that Fitzgeraldian oratory, not the pastiche schtick.  I guess I'm not as much a stickler for "doing the police in different voices."  My problem is that \*ATD\* has too much plot exposition and not enough "Pynchon" voice.

Nothing to add, just thanks for an illuminating comment.

Also, I thought of you when I saw [this](http://alumni.berkeley.edu/calmag/200703/100years/44\_45.pdf) in one of my alumni magazines.  Never mind the text, go to the second page for the photo.  It's clearly shot just a minute before or after the cover photo of the [Vintage Didion](http://www.amazon.com/Vintage-Didion-Joan/dp/1400033934/) -- the same scarf hangs to her right....

As a historian living in Chicago who studies culture (among other things) in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I read this post/passage with interest.  I had not read a sentence of Pynchon until this post, so I'm sorry, SEK, that you're sad about the book.  

Is Pynchon a purveyor of historical fiction, or just fiction that uses a lot of history? ... I wonder if Pynchon's professor character met Erick Larson's Devil in the White City?! - TL
