## <em>Whatever Works</em> is a poor title for a film in which nothing does.

Marvel at the frightening depth of my instant insights into the Woody Allen film _Whatever Works_ (as live-blogged to _Facebook_ last night and reprinted by a request I neither understand nor endorse):

		

					[]()
			

1.   As a New Jersey/Brooklyn Jew raised in the South, "Plaquemine
County" makes me want to stab my eyes out with bottles of Xanax coated
in safety foam so as to prolong the agony of having one of my favorite
directors prove himself to be too lazy to take the two seconds required
to let Google tell you that Louisiana's made of parishes, not counties.
2.  Evan Rachel Wood is from North Carolina, and as such should know
what a Southern accent actually sounds like and want to throw shit at
the screen after hearing whatever it is she did in this film.
3.  Larry David is actually being as unfunnily annoying as The Wife says he always is.
4.  Any film in which the situational humor stoops to a white woman
declaiming that "If you kick me out, I'm going to become an Asian
prostitute" probably shouldn't be made ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE WOODY
ALLEN. I mean, seriously. 
5.  SERIOUSLY.
6.  Homeless runaways in NYC aren't strikingly beautiful, and if you let
them sleep on your couch, they don't wear knee highs and pretty much
nothing else. I feel like there's old man id all over my television
BECAUSE THERE IS.
7.  SHE IS MASHING CRAWFISH. 
8.  MASHING.
9.  CRAWFISH.
10.  The following sentence isn't meta: "She had a high IQ and a low cut
dress. They just don't write them like they used to." No kidding?
11.  Twenty-two minutes and ten seconds in, Larry David wears a shirt I actually own. FML.
12.  David violates the fourth wall to ask: "Can you believe this little
inchworm has set her sights on me?" NO THAT'S WHY THIS MOVIE IS
TERRIBLE.
13.  That dog just peed on that other dog. That's not right. 
14.  "ANAL SPHINCTER"? It's one thing to hate the young for their youth, another entirely to do so this brazenly.
15.  "Ms. Natchez"? Sorry, Woody, but I'm going to defer to the woman
who loves me and turn this turd off. I just can't take anymore.
This is, I should add, the first Woody Allen I didn't finish, so I won't be spoiling anything when I say that I'm sure that in the end his young wife leaves him for a younger man and his mother-in-law loses Jesus and shacks up with a Jew.

 _the first Woody Allen I didn't finish_  

You made it through Deconstructing Harry and Alice? If so, tell me where to send the sympathy card.

_"She had a high IQ and a low cut dress."_

That sounds like something out of a Guy Noir routine, which can't be a good sign for a Woody Allen movie. 

Full disclosure: I stopped watching Woody Allen movies after "Hannah and her Sisters"; As much as I enjoyed it, I've read about many which followed, none of which seemed worth the time or effort. For that matter, I've not watched many that came before, either -- "Sleeper" is about the only one I can name off the top of my head.

Hannah and Her Sisters is a great joke around our household because of Max von Sydow's Frederick. We love this rant:  

"You see the whole culture. Nazis, deodorant salesmen, wrestlers, beauty contests, a talk show. Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling? But the worst are the fundamentalist preachers. Third grade con men telling the poor suckers that watch them that they speak with Jesus, and to please send in money. Money, money, money! If Jesus came back and saw what's going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up,"  

and often like to extend it to, "milkshakes! they are decadent: what kind of human mind could stoop to drinking such tripe!" (extend joke to infinity)

I've seen 28 of his films. My favorite by a long shot is Sweet and Lowdown: trust me. It's worth it. Other favorites? Broadway Danny Rose. Zelig. And, for Diane Weist's role, Bullets over Broadway. Chunks of Everyone Says I Love You are wonderful if you fast forward through most of the Woody Allen story. And What's Up Tiger Lily (although this is probably best seen for the first time when you're 16 or 17)

_his mother-in-law loses Jesus and shacks up with a Jew._ 

Oh, mais non.  She ends up with _two_ Jews.  And her old husband realizes he's gay.  And Boris ends up marrying a woman he literally falls onto about 5 minutes before the end of the film.

I have "stopped watching Woody Allen movies" to enough of an extent that I did not even know there was a new one. Had pretty much stopped (or anyway "stopped being excited about the chance to see a new one, shifted to grudgingly watching them hoping to be surprised") as of about Deconstructing Harry, but that Penelope Cruz train wreck a couple of years ago moved Allen into not-at-all-interested territory for me.

Huh, funny -- looking at [my impressions](http://readin.com/blog/?k=movie:barcelona) at the time, it seems like I enjoyed that Penelope Cruz train wreck more than I remember having done. In retrospect it seems like a really awful movie, bad enough to merit crossing its director off the list for good. Or like the straw that broke the camel's back at any rate.

This is why I start screaming whenever I see a bit of Good Will Hunting. Over and over I yell "Why are you talking like a Kennedy! Why are you talking like a Kennedy!" Just because the rest of the country thinks that the Kennedy's have Boston accents and that a kid from Southie would talk like that doesn't mean someone actually from the area should believe and act like the Kennedy's don't have a Brahmin specific accent. BAH. 

I think this is also a large part of the reason I actually love Eliza Dushku. Her Boston accent is real, and if it's not real for her, it's at least the Boston accent you actually hear in the world

I actually had to look at his [IMDB page]() to respond to these comments, which in and of itself says something significant about my disengagement with his work; that said, with the exception of _Sweet and Lowdown_, it looks like I haven't enjoyed one of his films since 1994, which is probably the same year I started watching them.  (I would've been in tenth grade, which sounds about right.)  His career's really been all downhill for me, it seems; however, its high points number more than just _Hannah and Her Sisters_.  I love the orneriness of _Stardust Memoirs_; the pomp of _Crimes and Misdemeanors_; the sheer inventiveness of _The Purple Rose of Cairo_.  He's a towering figure in American cinema, and yet he's really underrated as a director: the writing and the shtick garner all the attention, the pacing and framing not so much, and on a technical level, even the recent material is brilliant.

I just don't want to watch it anymore.

Hey thanks for pointing to his IMDB page. I just found out he directed a movie called "Love and Death" around the time of "Annie Hall" which I have never heard of, let alone seen. That is certainly one for the Netflix queue. I had sort of never realized how early in his career "Annie Hall" was, his sixth movie only -- for some reason I thought the corpus of "early Woody Allen films" was larger than that.

I [adore _Love and Death_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/wheat-lots-of-w.html) more than it deserves, but it's right up there with _Sleeper_ as a candidate for his funniest film.

See I would say  "Bananas" is funnier than "Sleeper". But that may  be primarily because I've seen "Bananas" more recently.

This is an _Animal Crackers_ vs. _Duck Soup_ debate: both hilarious, but one's just more of a coherent film than the other.

_Deconstructing Harry_ isn't too bad.  But, no, I'd agree he seems to have been in a low patch, quality wise, for a while.

My love for the deathless _Love and Death_ surpasses, I believe, even SEK's. ('I shall walk through the valley of the shadow of death. In fact, now that I come to think of it, I shall _run_ through the valley of the shadow of death, because ... you ... get out of the valley quicker that way.')

More: I'm nearly finished reading _War and Peace_ (Napoleon is about to enter Moscow; halfway through book eleven) and it's very very good, but I'm repeatedly reminded that Allen covers pretty much all everything Tolstoy does, plus he has the big laughs.  Seriously: one consequence of my finally getting around to reading _War and Peace_ is thinking what a good light it casts upon Allen's film.

Wheat.  Wheat. Fields and fields of wheat. 

Whatever Works was completely predictable, but I still laughed.  Also, the very end of the film turns all Boris' supposed cynicism on it's ear, when his brief closing speech to the camera makes clear that "whatever works" is not the mantra of a curmudgeon, but a true humanist.  

Anyway, those of you saying Allen's in a low period are nuts. In the last five years he's made three irresistable films; that he also made a couple of movies that were merely entertaining in that period doesn't change that.

Just seen Whatever Works this evening. It is contrived, tiresome, boring, lazy & incompetent. I would put up with it if it had been funny in any sense, but it was pompous & very desperate. Larry David usually so good at the 'Basil Fawlty' moment wasn't given a ghost of a chance. The actor who played the English guy could not act AT ALL. A very very two-dimensional effort at characterisation for all the chartacters and pointless story if you could even call it that. When you look at really funny films by Woody Allen such as Sleeper, Bananas, Love & Death, Annie Hall etc this is total rubbish. You can actually hear the camera in several of the scenes, something a good director would try & do something about and an unknown would be called a blatant amateur for if he didn't. Ever since Bullets over Broadway Woody Allen's films have to be graded a terrible green & yellow colour, it's like suffering from a kind of colour-blindness. Just shoot in black & white in future. His films started to go off the rails with Hannah & Her Sisters, since when was Michael Caine funny anyway. WW completes this sad sad deterioration.
