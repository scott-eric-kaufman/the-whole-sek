## Nude 'Brews, Shiny Zambonis & Sickly Indians; or, What Is This Place?

That [this story](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html) breaks the same day [this one](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901859.html) does is your garden-variety coincidence.  That this corruption scandal involves Jack Abramoff (former friend of the upstanding Grover Norquist) interests me less than the cultural politics involved in the various scandals.  (Don't fret, children, I'll double back to the pornography momentarily.)  Abramoff and Ralph Reed worked to shut down a lucrative Indian casino owned and operated by the Tigua tribe.  "We should continue to pile it on until the place is shuttered," he writes Reed.  He refers to the Tiguas as monkeys, troglodytes and worse.  (Lest you think I spout liberal propaganda, be informed that I borrow this information from [Foxnews](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,154439,00.html).  They've _reported_, now I'm _deciding_.)  

Time passes.  Abramoff convinces the Tigua tribe hire him as a consultant who can help them reopen the casino.  (He is paid to close its doors.  He is paid to open them.)  He then convinces the board of the Eshkol Academy, a Jewish boys school he funded, to purchase life insurance policies on the Tigua elders.  These moneys could be used to purchase an _additional_ Zamboni to add to the rink-less school's growing collection.  (The school had previously purchased two other Zambonis despite not owning a hockey rink.)  It should be obvious to you that Eshkol Academy was, in the damning words of Abramoff himself, a "front group."  About that time Abramoff requested all future unnecessary donations from Native American tribes to his Zamboni-happy Hebrew school go directly through him: "Please tell [the Native Americans] that we are 'using the school as our conduit for some of activities.'"  

Why the tribes simply didn't donate another Zamboni is beyond me.  By now they must have known the terrible truth that _Jews love Zambonis_.  Their sultry Italian names remind wealthy Jews of forbidden thrusts in bombed out [shiksa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiksa) brothels.  The thought of their shiny hulls resurfacing ice recalls some Old Testament obliteration of enemies of the wandering Jewish state.  The Zamboni symbolizes the Jewish love of slates wiped clean and women whose touch corrupts.  _Or so you would think._ It turns out Abramoff simply decided Native Americans didn't need Zambonis any more than he didn't, and that if it came down to who needed-it-less more, than the more less-needy party which deserved it was his own.  And if they complained, _his front company was the beneficiary of the Native Americans' life insurance policies_.   

Just so this is all clear: a high-ranking Republican lobbyist was paid by one client to shut an Indian casino down, then by another another to reopen it.  The funds from those fees (as well as direct donations) were then used to purchase Zambonis for a Hebrew school without a hockey rink.  Some of them were also used to purchase life insurance policies on the elders of the Native American tribes whose casino had been closed and reopened by Abramoff and whose direct donations were used to purchase Zambonis.  _Perfectly intelligible._ In addition to being bizarre beyond the telling, news of this colorful cultural constellation of corruption breaks the same day that Bush officials inform the nation of the newest threat to the American Way of Life:

Pornography.  Not the pornographic material already illegal, mind you, but the kind that depicts and is marketed to consenting adults.  (You!  Put down that [Dworkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea\_Dworkin)!  This debate is not that debate but another one entirely!  We can have _that_ debate later [if we don't drown first](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science\_technology/article312997.ece).)  For those of you who may be confused, this announcement is a complete coincidence.  The Administration did not plan to announce the new Department of Hardcore Pornography on the same day the story of the Jew who swindled the Indians in order to buy Zambonis broke.  I repeat:

This.  Is.  Your.  Garden.  Variety.  Coincidence.

_Or is it?_

I will now violate many rules of blog etiquette and comment on my own post:

Despite making light of the events mentioned above, I must admit that I only joke because I'm infuriated by the absurdity of it all.  _Zambonis?_  I'd have preferred the money be used to prepare the little Jewlings for their Bar and Bat Mitzvahs.  Instead Abramoff macerated logic by purchasing Zambonis for nonexistent hockey rinks!  I'm often ashamed of my people (for much the same reason that I'm often ashamed of _all_ people, only I feel more a party to the shame of those who repudiate--in deeds but certainly not words--the same heritage I've spent the past decade disowning).  We should know better than to prey on the weak and powerless; but then again, so should pretty much everyone else.  It's like [Carson Daly says](http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/cl-et-earl20sep20,0,4475485.story?coll=cl-home-more-channels): "I believe in karma."  (Yes, there is a context for that remark, and yes, there's quite a story as to why I enjoy Jason Lee's jacked-up stupidity as much as I do, but that will have to wait until the inaugural _Acephalous Review of New Television Shows Scott Has Bothered To Watch_.  Check your local listings for time and channel...)
