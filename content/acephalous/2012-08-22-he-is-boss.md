[![romney family](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/romney-family.jpg "romney family")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/romney-family.jpg)

What do the ladies want? Men want wide-hipped young sluts, while 
ladies want old men like me—that’s why the ladies love men my age even
 though I can’t stand the sight of them. That celebrity couple disgusts 
me—it disgusts me like it would another man my age seeing a woman our 
age wet and naked. Old women look old, and it’s cruel to make me look at
 them. There’s this one rich old bird who looks hot, but at her age she 
sags in all the wrong the places as any drunken frat boy knows and they 
wouldn’t bone her for all her money.

It’s a good thing Mitt Romney’s not a drunken frat boy.

You know why Mitt Romney’s awesome? Check out his stats: he has so 
much money he gives it away and when he touches things he rules them. He
 has kids. They’re boys. All of them. Science says that means he’s 
awesome. So does money. Rich people are mostly men. See that picture? No
 daughters. Barely any granddaughters either. When he goes to church _he goes to church_. He gets _all up_ in that house.

Obama? All daughters. Mister Rogers was a pussy.

Science says Romney should have all the lady-votes. Even Obama’s 
bitch should vote for him. I’m not saying he’s a polygamist, but he 
could be if he wanted to. Like this rich guy who had 61 children and 
they were all boys. He can’t have a harem, but if he could bitches would
 be lining up to join it. He’s in charge. Because now that we don’t hunt
 it’s all about the money and Mitt has more. He’s more President than 
the last eight Presidents. If he paid taxes, he’d pay more a year than 
Obama’s worth. If he didn’t tap ass so expertly he’d have more money 
than the only wealthy black guy I can think of who’s a rapper.

It’s time for Romney to drop trou’ and show us his moneybags.

Some hippies think calling him “R-MONEY” is funny. The only wealthy 
black guy I can think of uses lowercase letters but R-MONEY’s 
capitalized. He drops can do what black rappers do only bigger. Rappers 
have money, but R-MONEY’s money has money and it lives in money. He has 
so much money it’s heavy.

Romney’s always saying that he loves money, and that we should love 
money, but the haters will hate. He celebrates people with money and how
 they got it. He even loves the little money so much he once didn’t give
 in a fight to protect it. He could’ve sued that guy and took his money 
but the point is he was on an airplane he didn’t own because he cares 
about the little money. He could buy his own airplanes and still have 
more money than an actress and a Senator. And the Senator can’t even 
remember how many houses he owns.

I suppose he’s frontin’ and good on him. Humility is next to 
godliness which is next to money. But he needs to stop frontin’ and 
start ballin’ like the player he is. He should show us his money. He 
should show us how awesome it is having his money. People will be like 
“I don’t hate you or your money! I love your money!” They sit on there 
couches without nearly the amount of his money and watch someone who 
only acts like he has money curb-stomping poor people. They don’t hate 
that guy with the 17 Italian cars because he has 39 other ones and 
they’re green. Lots of children of men like Mitt Romney don’t turn into 
R-MONEY. That Senator has more houses than he can remember but is his 
daughter going to turn into R-MONEY?

Romney should find out what happened to some other rich guy but not 
tell anyone about it because he voted for Obama. But he spent his money 
so hard nobody can even find him anymore. When someone asked that rich 
guy about his money he said he’d had it since the Puritans. Romney 
should follow his lead and talk about the rich history of his money all 
the time.

He’s always had money—his Dad was CEO and America—but he gave it 
Dad’s money away and started a school so people remembered Dad’s money. 
Why? Because he already had his money by the time Dad kicked. His Dad 
was a boss. So is Romney. Men want to be under him. He will curb-stomp 
poor people. His sons will curb-stomp poor people. Obama was never a 
boss until the democratic process made him one and only because when 
Americans travel to Europe they act like assholes. Obama made his little
 money in politics and by writing about himself. He’d be nothing without
 a foul-mouthed Jew.

Elections aren’t about issues. They’re not about our money. They’re 
about his money and what it took to get it: leadership. Romney rules and
 we don’t. Some former someone once had some uppity bitch try to teach 
him to be like Romney and she failed:

“Show us your big dick” she said. “A man is top dog” she 
said. Then she said “Everyone thinks you’re a pussy so prove you can 
man-up.” But she also said the opposite about another guy when she 
didn’t like him.

But she was right the first time—only a man with a dick that makes 
sons and grandsons who rape people is a man. Some lady told us that we 
need a lot of people and Romney made a lot of people and they’re men. A 
magazine called Romney a pussy, but look at the size of his money. Look 
at what his dick made. Look at his wife back when she was attractive and
 look at him smirking about the ass she lost to time. Why should he 
worry about people knowing about his money? I bet he doesn’t. He’s done 
everything right and should own it. And by own it I mean flash mad 
plastic and put it on a jet or something.

By the way, am I the only person looking at the picture thinking "Wow, Mitt Romney's head is big. Like photoshopped over someone else Big."?
