John McCain can't lie to you when he looks you in the eye.

He was looking around the auditorium for Governor Palin because she hadn't shown up or called in sick. She's about out of unexcused absences.  

Seriously, good post. I guess it is hard to look someone in the eye and be rude and condescending and lie at the same time.

I like the rhyme in you last line there.  You need one for Palin too: "Governor Palin knows nought about the balin' when the economy is failin'."  That sort of thing.

I watched the debate and 15 minutes in started to notice McCain doing the "avoidy" thing with not looking at Obama.  It's more than VERY creepy - it's rude...

Go Obama!  Go Vegan!  

Thanks for inviting comment :)
