(_Apparently TypePad timed out and didn't post this yesterday, in case you're wondering why it only went up now._)

Seems someone forgot to tell Ike what everyone on the right knows (but oddly never cites a source for): [the](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/11/14/obamateurism-of-the-day-156/) [President](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/11/024948.php) [never](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15516) [ever](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/bowing-before-monarchs-and-tyrants.html) [bows](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/11/obamas\_botched\_bow.html).
Because as even a cursory search of the AP Image archive indicates, the
man could not stop bowing. Hello there, Pope John XXIII!

we have all been French since 2 September 1959
.
Eisenhower clearly demonstrated by that bow that the American President
is a subordinate of the French, which means that for the past 50 years
America has been a French territory with pretensions of sovereignty. 
Mon Dieu!

You're sure he's bowing? Sure that's not curvature of the spine?  I know how you Americans like your Presidents with physical deformity.

And to think, if I wasn't so stupid as to read blogs, I never would have known about the latest ridiculous faux outrage.  That kills me.

Not that blogs aren't the devil (they clearly are), but you could've gotten this from the [_Washington Post_](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/13/AR2009111301108.html?sub=AR) too.

This whole bowing thing is out of control.  I like my presidents demanding respect from others without giving any in return.  Now what was that type of person called?... Oh yeah!  A jackass!

Now I know why I suddenly got all that traffic on my old blog entry (Nixon and Hirohito): [http://jprschaefer.blogspot.com/2009/04/president-bows-to-foreign-leader.html](http://jprschaefer.blogspot.com/2009/04/president-bows-to-foreign-leader.html)
