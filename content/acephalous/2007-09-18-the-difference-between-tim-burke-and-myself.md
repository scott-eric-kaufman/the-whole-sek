## The Difference Between Tim Burke and Myself

I wouldn't have been able to strangle the desire to open [this post](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=430) thus:
I agree that academic prose is sometimes both boring and frustrating
because of the extent to which academics overqualify and parse every
substantive claim they are making, as it can lead to endless thickets of
dependent clauses designed to cover all possible objections by
pre-emptively conceding to them; at the same time, scholarship
needs to be something more and something better than what any random
person pulled off the street might say off the top of their head—more
based in specific evidence, more aware of the history of thought and
expression on a given topic (I’d like to say more subtle, more nuanced,
more complex, but that’s not a necessity)—because sometimes the evidence and
the historiography justify being very direct and intense in a scholarly
argument.

You don't know how close I came to doing that. Perhaps it's best the world never know.

I find that a big part of my editing these days, particualraly when incorporating older work, is taking out all the stupid pointless qualifiers.  The other is of course breaking up all the stupid compound sentences.

The old semicolon gets you every time, eh? - TL
