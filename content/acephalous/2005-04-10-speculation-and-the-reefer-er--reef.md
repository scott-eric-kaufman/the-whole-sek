## Speculation and the Reefer, er,  Reef

Currently reading David Dobb's excellent (if unfortunately titled) [_Reef Madness_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375421610/qid=1113182711/sr=8-1/ref=pd\_ka\_1/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and its generalist claims about the intellectual culture in the 1830s, '40s, and '50s dovetail nicely with what the ones I would make were I writing a popular intellectual history instead of a dissertation.  (Were that I writing a popular intellectual history!  Were that I could write something well, and appealing, and with a chance--slim though it would be--to alter the contemporary intellectual scene, i.e. the small but devoted readership of [_The New York Review of Books_](http://nybooks.com).)  But I have a few complaints, foremost among them Dobb's desire to speculate when he's already informed us that he lacks the grounds to.  For example, Dobbs says
Alexander [Agassiz] never wrote a memoir, and as an adult he actively sheltered himself and his family from the sort of scrutiny his father had invited.  His surviving letters reveal little of his personal history, for while there are many, he destroyed those more intimate.  His letterpress letter books have crucial pages razored out, and the papers lack diaries and letters mentioned elsewhere. (37)

Dobbs wears his ethical commitment proudly here, and signals readers of it throughout the text with the usual speculative flares: "would," "probably," "if," "possible," "possibly," "likely," etc.  (The magnum opus of speculative non-fiction is still, to my mind, Sebastian Junger's _The Perfect Storm_, but that's another post.)  But he intermingles what he knows from what he thinks he knows too, well, seamlessly.  The narrative moves at so brisk a clip that passages like this one which follow the one quoted above almost slip by unnoticed:
Having spent the previous eighteen months in limbo as his parents parted ways, by all reports sensitive and prone to melancholy anyway, Alex probably fet something short of "especially happy" that winter. (45)

Now, that has all the markings of a successful bit of speculative non-fiction, by which I mean it's self-conscious about its status as history and calls attention to itself as an act of speculation.  But I take issue with that "especially happy."  It comes from the memoirs of a family member of Alex's mother Cecile (with whom Alex had spent that winter), who relates her saying 
the Freiburg winter, with its bracing summer air, was an especially happy time for the children.  Alexander now became a proficient skater, an art in which as a young man he excelled...the boy and his mother spent many happy hours, while she sat in one of the high-backed sleds of that region, which he skillfully guided through the gay crowd of all ages who glided gracefully over the ice. (45)

Dobbs feels sufficiently strongly about the constitution of young Alexander Agassiz that he sees no problem casting doubt on his mother's account (admittedly learned second-hand) of that "especially happy" winter.  It's one thing to speculate when faced with a lack of evidence, another speculate in the face of it.  I've seen this tendency in the work of professional biographers--Janet Browne's exhaustive life of Darwin brims with it--but _Reef Madness_ is a slim volume more concerned with intellectual history than the personages responsible for it.  It's not (as Browne's is) an exhaustively researched 2 vol. biography in which the author's acquired an understanding of his or her subject that warrants such counter-speculation.  When Browne claims Darwin's feelings are contrary to the ones he expresses in letters or his diaries (and presents compelling reasons for her suspicions), I feel she's earned enough lattitude to question the integrity of the written record.  I don't feel Dobbs has, which brings me to my real question:

Where's that line?  At what point does one earn the right to engage in this sort of speculation? 

I ask, in part, because of the concerns [the Little Professor](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2005/03/open\_the\_valve.html) often raises about being mistaken for a historian.  As a literary scholar, I've learned to read literary works in a particular way (lots of them actually) in which I have license to interpret them, well, pretty much as I please.  But as a historicist, if not historian, I often wonder whether I'm not reading historical works as a literary critic and thus commiting sins more grevious than those for which I (mildly) scold Dobbs.

That said, I'll present some of _Reef Madness'_ highlights:

*   Henry David Thoreau gave Louis Agassiz a bear.  It didn't work out. "Presumably a symbol of nature's noble symplicity, the bear simplified nothing, though it did offer unpredictable entertainment, as when during a dinner party is slipped its chains in the basement, raided the wine cask, and stumbled upstairs..." (56).
*   When Agassiz married Anna Russell "he made himself brother-in-law to his best friend; brother-in-law to his wife's (and his) new uncle; brother-in-law to his best friend's wife (Mimi); and, naturally, a cousin to himself a couple times over and at least once removed" (65).  This may only interest me because of certain, well, "connections" with Mississippi.
*   Dobbs' description of the initial debate between an empirical evolutionism and a creationist idealism is priceless, but in absolutely no way appropos to anything anyone I know must confront daily.  Comparing creationist elaborations to the fanciful evolutionary schema of _The Vestiges_ (whose theories of "monstrous births" I've written about elsewhere), Dobbs writes "both made the same sort of unfounded conceptual jump--exciting but unsupportable--that left one standing on air.  As [Asa Gray] put it to Hooker in 1858, '[I] sympathize more with & estimate higher the slow induction that leads step by step to sound conclusions so far as they go, than the bolder flights of genius which so often leads teh possessor to mount three pairs of steps only to jump out of the garret window'" (81).

But you are a literary critic, right? So isn't it ok to read as one? I'm not saying become a Marxist like some assholes I could name, but maybe you should cut yourself some slack. Just a thought.

Dude, I don't write that much for some /papers/. Hell, /most/ papers. (Also, SG has a point.)
