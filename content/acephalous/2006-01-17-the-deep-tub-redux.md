Being clever is difficult.  

Everything written today fails to live up to the pale parody I produced Monday.  

Much blather.  

Oodles of bloviation.  

But no substance.  Thus no new posts.  Plus I've been ill.  

Under the weather.  

Not seriously.  

Just stomachly.  

Which doesn't count.  Couldn't.  

Whose stomach isn't in knots these days?  

Even the cats have hairballs.  The stress gets to them.  It gets to us all.  So we relax.

In deep tubs. 

Which is why instead of a post tonight I present "[The Deep Tub](http://www.katchor.com/deep-tub-small.jpg)."  

Isn't it disturbing?  It won't bother you at first.  Let it sink in.

Or sink in yourself.  This is existential terror in technicolor. 

Enjoy!
