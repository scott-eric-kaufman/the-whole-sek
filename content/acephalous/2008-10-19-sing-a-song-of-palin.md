Via [Kyle Gann](http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2008/10/taking\_responsibility\_for\_my\_i.html)—my [second-favorite](http://www.artsjournal.com/quickstudy/)
ArtsJournal blogger—comes this mesmerizing clip of someone “appl[ying]
the exact same rhythmic technique to Sarah Palin that [he] did to
Custer.” That it’s the “_exact same_ rhythmic technique” is a
claim I believe but can’t evaluate—I don’t know squat about
composition, and what little I know I’ve picked up from reading Gann. _Deliberately_.  So you can guess which part of [this](http://www.kylegann.com/Custune2.html) I understand.  Now, re-read that last paragraph and then listen to an excerpt of “[Custer: If I Were an Indian…](http://home.earthlink.net/%!E(MISSING)kgann/Gannaudio.html)”   [**UPDATE:** You can download the entire work [here](http://www.kylegann.com/Gannaudio.html).]

Compelling, aint it?  

But enough about my rank ignorance.  Here’s Palin:

I found out something interesting about Palin's overall speech pattern... She speaks with a modified Minnesota accent.  This is because Wascilla was founded by a group of people moving from Minnesota.  

Having grown up in Minnesota and now living here (after about 15 years in Colorado and Nebraska) I thought she sounded 'familiar' -- like many of the Hockey Moms and other people around here.  To be honest, I wish she would use her accent to say something more intelligent... but, I can't get what I wish for.

Also -- just FYI, Minnesotans don't seem to be in favor of voting for her and her accent... Obama is way ahead in the local polls!

WHile it's tempting, I'm glad that I don't have a semi-atonal jazz piano noodling behind me.  It's a lot of pressure, and it would MEAN that I would have TO BE much more DELIBerate in the WORDS I chose to place RANDOM EMPHASIS UPON.  

Baa bee oww.

The Palin piece is charming in a juvenile way, and the juxtaposition of image, speech, and music makes her sound like a lunatic. The Custer piece is insufferable. But the whole thing just makes me long for the final movement of _A Love Supreme_ ('Psalm'), which - according to Lewis Porter's (excellent) Trane biography - is itself a one-note-per-word performance of a written/spoken text, namely the prayer in the album's liner notes.

Wow. I suddenly have a hate-on for fusion. And I usually like jazz...
