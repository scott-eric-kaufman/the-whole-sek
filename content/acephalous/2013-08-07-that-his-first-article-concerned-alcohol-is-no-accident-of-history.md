Is a line that [can now appear in my obituary](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/06/stolis-parent-company-changes-nondiscrimination-policy-to-include-gay-but-not-trans-employees/). (And the article's about _vodka_ no less.) In addition to writing articles, my duties at _The Raw Story_ will include pulling and titling links to wire stories. They won't be under my byline, but I have a [feeling](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/06/austrian-catholic-church-seeks-to-replace-the-cool-wetness-of-a-lake-with-mass/) you'll be able to tell which ones are [mine](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/06/handcuffed-god-fearing-man-in-locked-box-dropped-from-airplane/).

I'll still be writing here, though, as my job doesn't entail the kind
 of editorializing I'm incapable of not doing. As a matter of fact, I'll
 still be here when my _other_ other gig starts on the 15th. (But more on that later.)
