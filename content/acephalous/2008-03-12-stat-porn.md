## Stat Porn

A fellow blogger wrote in utter disbelief:
YOU CHECK YOUR STATS ALL THE TIME ALL BLOGGERS DO STOP LYING ABOUT IT AND TAKING THE HIGHER GROUND IN THE GREAT VANITY DEBATE BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CHECK YOUR STATS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I DO TOO AND YOU BETTER NOT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A PREENING NARCISSIST FOR CHECKING MY STATS!

(I'm paraphrasing.)  I responded that if her stats looked like my stats, she wouldn't check them either.  She still didn't believe me.  Maybe this will convince her:

(_Click to render the horror legible_.)

Now tell me, how interesting do you find the parade of Hello Kitties?  Even peppered with the occasional office sex and legitimate hit, I'm not seeing how that qualifies as quality entertainment.

Before you ask: yes, this post is merely an elaborate excuse to demonstrate my dominion over the artist once known as "Whitey Kitty."

SEK,

Have you figured out where Hello Kitty is linking?  Which of your posts has that site's attention?!

...I suppose, of course, if you answer my question, then you're fulfilling "ALL CAPS"'s fantasy about your obsessive checking compulsion.

I know exactly where [where the hits are coming from](http://images.google.com/images?q=hello+kitty), Tim, and it's already taken top-billing on my CV:

Author of Google's #1 source for Hello Kitty pictures.

As my wife -- who walked in when I had the search open, and to whom I had to explain what I was up to with Hello Kitty all up in my monitor -- said: "You must be proud."

And _I am_, God help me, _I am_.

A high proportion of my hits, perhaps a third, are for images. All of them images which I pirated without acknowledgment.

I turned turned the image search off my blog about the time 2/3 of the hits were an image search for "Murcielago." The stats became more interesting almost instantly.

I just want to announce that I was not the blogger who was foolish enough to admit out loud and in caps that I check my stats all the time ---- I repress those voices to an inner monologue, thank you very much. 

Now, constantly refreshing my in-box to see if people have left any comments on my blog ---- that I'm going to have to admit to.

Needily/narcissistically yours,  

Sisyphus

I came for the Hello Kitty; I stayed for the self-abnegation.  Six of one, half dozen of the other.

Emerson, that cat _is_ fantastic.  Esp. in [this picture](http://nerdnirvana.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/13207.jpg).

Greg, I don't think I can block image search in TypePad.  (A quick check of the Knowledge Base seems to confirm this.)  

Sisyphus doth protest too much.  If I didn't know it wasn't her, I'd think it was.

Lloyd, I've added you to my RSS reader, but not the roll yet.  I'm on it.

Ari, I _love_ self-abnegating.  One word, double the self!  Run yourself down twice as fast, with New Fast-Acting Self-Abnegation!

Thanks to an ill-conceived post about watching movies with your parents that erupt into unexpected, graphic sex scenes, and Google's conveniently ineradicable cache feature, I get a whole ton of this.  

[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2320/2330097895\_89412dbba3\_o.jpg](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2320/2330097895\_89412dbba3\_o.jpg)  

It's really demoralizing.

But why does the Hello Kitty image search lead to your page?  I don't understand.

Looks like it doesn't anymore!  My work here is done.  (I'd used the first image in the search a few months back, but now they've got it headed somewhere else.  Huzzah!)

I get a lot of hits from a picture of Daring Jumping Spiders.  I'm fine with that.

You still come up as the first hit for hello kitty when I do the image search.  It makes dealing with google awkward if we don't all get the same results--no more telling people to use "I'm getting lucky."

I'm also having a hard time imagining that you get tired of looking at that stats page, Scott.  I've already rechecked it three or four times since I opened this window.

It could be worse - my blog came up in a search for "taxidermied ferret."  And yes, that actually was related to a post.
