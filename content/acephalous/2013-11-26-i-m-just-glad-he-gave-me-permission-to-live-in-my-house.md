			**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** I heard you talking on the phone about some “doctor” you think is all-powerful.

**SEK:** What?

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** On your phone, you were telling someone about this “doctor” you found, could do all these — come back from the dead.

**SEK:** Wouldn’t surprise me.

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** Is his name “Jesus”?

**SEK:** Nope.

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** What’s his name?

**SEK:** I don’t actually know.

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** Yet you said you’d trust him.

**SEK:** Sounds like me.

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** I can tell you his name.

**SEK:** No, really, it’s fine –

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** I know his name. He whispered it in my ear every night until –

**SEK:** No, really, you don’t understand –

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** His name is –

**SEK:** “SATAN,” I know, his name is “SATAN.”

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** “SATAN.”

**SEK:** I’ve had this conversation before, quite a few times, in many a context.

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** “LUCIFER.”

**SEK:** Please, I know what you’re gonna –

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** “BEEZLE THE BUB.”

**SEK:** I think you mean “BEEZLE _OF_ THE BUB.”

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** You would know better than me.

**SEK:** Because I’m a Jew?

**SEK’S NEIGHBOR:** And yet you live right next door.
