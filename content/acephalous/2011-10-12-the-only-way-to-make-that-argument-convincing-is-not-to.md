## The only way to make that argument convincing is not to.

Scott’s already [addressed](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/10/always-the-hippies) [this nonsense](http://the53.tumblr.com/post/11055265485/ewerickson-declares-hes-one-of-the-53), but since I’m the visual rhetoric guy, I thought I’d take a whack at the Erick Erickson’s contribution to We Are The 53%!:(MISSING)

[![erick erickson](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/erick-erickson.jpg "erick erickson")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/erick-erickson.jpg)

First and foremost, Erickson’s point is that he works three jobs, and  then something, something, something, and something else.  Whatever his  point is, he doesn’t particularly care whether or not he communicates  it.  An illegible image of some scribbles isn’t likely to inspire a  movement.  It’s akin to a child screaming for attention for attention’s  sake, because without legible words the only message Erickson can  communicate is that he wants to communicate a message.  His incompetence  has rendered his point beside itself—because his point is that he is  making a point, damn it, and he is making it on the Internet.

He actually states [his argument](http://www.redstate.com/erick/2011/10/11/little-lee-fang-whines-about-me-stealing-the-hippies-thunder-iamthe53/) over at _Red State_, but I think he had a better chance garnering sympathy with his non-message:

[A critic] wants you to fixate on the new house and  ignore the old house.  My  wife and I bought it for $110,000.00 in March  of 2001.  It is appraised,  for taxes, at $119,000.00.  We’re having a  tough time selling it.  My  student loans payments are more each month  than the mortgage.  But with  the new house?  It was originally for sale  for over $600,000.00 and we  benefited from the misery of others in the  market downturn. It was tasty misery at that.

The man owns two homes—one of which is worth upward of half a million  dollars—and clearly enjoys exploiting the market conditions he and his  fellow-travelers created.  Revels in it.  Hence the significance of the  non-message he communicates: when he tells people what he truly  believes, they’ll understand that Erickson is as odious as the policies  he supports.  Your average human being tends to be better than the worst  consequences of his or her political beliefs.  For example, most  conservatives champion the free market, but when they meet someone who  lost everything when the housing bubble burst, they respond  sympathetically because, for them, the consequences of their belief are  systemic.  They take no personal joy in someone else’s homelessness.

Erick Erickson, however, is not an average human being.  He’s a spoiled man-child devoted to an ideology so despicable not even _he_ can bring himself to communicate it directly.  Yet he feels compelled  to because he knows there are other terrible people out there who share  the-sentiments-that-shall-not-shared and genuinely seeks their  approval.  So what does he do?

He artfully arranges some books on the desk behind him, takes off his  shirt and scribbles his foul screed.  He performs the very act  (“whining”) he condemns in blissful ignorance of his unintentionally  ironic statement.  The man can do nothing but whine—and he proves as  much by whining an unintelligible criticism of whining.  If there’s a  market for shirtless men who loudly say nothing, I suppose we ought to  thank Erickson for cornering it for us.  _Somebody_ had to, and far better him than us.

Ermmm.... Maybe this is obvious, but Erickson is clearly parodying the tumblr posts at [http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/.](http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/.) I don't disagree that it's a less than effective way to communicate protest, but that's a charge you'd have to level against the 99percenters, not Erickson. (Though to be clear, Erickson is in every other discernible way a wanker...)

I tried to comment on this, but my comment didn't save for some reason.  So I put the gist of it [here](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com/2011/10/more-occupy-wall-street.html).
