If for some inconceivable reason you prefer your podcast clean-shaven, you can skip watching [Rob and I debate the merits of] (http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/01/an-awesome-mighty-thing-this-first-ever-lawyers-guns-money-podcast-is)_[The Hobbit](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/01/an-awesome-mighty-thing-this-first-ever-lawyers-guns-money-podcast-is)_ and [download it in .mp3 format](http://lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/podcast/podcast01-farley-sek-hobbit.mp3) or listen to the whole _Lawyers, Guns & Money_ crew discussing all sorts of things in the years to come by subscribing to [the RSS feed for the new podcast](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/category/podcast/feed) 

If you're partial to my blather, though, have no fear: I'll link to any I participate in. Also, since I'm the one running the show over there, I may take the initiative and do a few odd podcasts of my own. I have some ... _ideas_. Stay tuned.

Just to let you know, the rss feed redirects to a GoDaddy page. With no Danica Patrick.

Dammit -- you posted that the link was broken just before I commented that the link was broken. So ignore my comment.

But otherwise, I'm completely on board for this podcast thing. Thought you'd be hairier, though.

Fixed! 

And I totally should've had a Hirsute Expectations competition before revealing myself to the Internet. Not that I'm hidden, mind you...
