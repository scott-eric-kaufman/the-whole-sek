9:30-11:00 AM

135 Humanities Instructional Building

Come hear five bloggers from the School of Humanities give advice to
students, faculty, and members of the general public about designing
and maintaining a successful academic blog.

Questions include: How do you define the genre of the web log in your
own terms? How do you balance the personal, the political, and the
professional in a blogging persona? How do you find a niche in a
crowded marketplace of ideas and build an audience? How do you
capitalize on blogging communities and group blogging? What about
intellectual property, copyright, and academic labor issues?

Participants include Catherine Liu of [Higher Yearning](http://www.higher-yearning.org/blog.html), Peter Krapp of [Distraction Economy](http://www.distraction-economy.org/), Scott Kaufman of [Acephalous](http://acephalous.typepad.com/), Julia Lupton of [Design Your Life](http://www.design-your-life.org/), and Elizabeth Losh of [Virtualpolitik](http://www.virtualpolitik.org/).

Co-sponsored by [SCIWRITER](http://sciwriter.org/).
