If you spy me from the feminine hygiene aisle, refrain from hailing if you'd rather not interpellate me that way.Â  

_I'm_ _just saying._\*

Also, it goes without saying, but I should say it anyway: there's nothing inherently embarrassing about buying feminine hygiene products.  I do it for the wife all the time.  But if _you_ are likely to be embarrassed if someone sees you purchasing them, it's probably best not to yell "HEY PROFESSOR KAUFMAN!" when you catch me in the corner of your eye.

"there's nothing inherently embarrassing about buying feminine hygiene products. I do it for the wife all the time"

Isn't the ur-text for 20th century male embarrassment about buying Tampons PKD's _Confessions of a Crap Artist_?  If I remember rightly, there's a scene in there where a guy works himself up into a rage that his wife dared to send him out to buy them and comes home and hits her.  It's done from his point of view, so there's a sort of queasy intelligibility to it.  He dies from an anger-fueled heart attack later, so that's OK.
