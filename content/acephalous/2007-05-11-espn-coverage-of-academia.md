			**Q:** So you placed that article in an important journal?  How'd that happen?

**A:** You know, I don't know.  I mean, I worked hard, put my faith in God, and am thankful He blessed me with enough talent to understand the disembodiment of (h)empty subjectivity in '60s utopian fiction.

**Q:** I'm sure people ask this all the time, but how does the magic happen?  Do you sit down and let it flow?

**A:** Lot of people think that, but I mean, what happens is that I put in 110%!e(MISSING)ffort eight days a week and send it off.  Then later someone writes some notes on it and then I take it to the next level.  I just thank God though for giving me the gift of having the ability to do that.

_Christ on a cracker_, I don't blog for a week and I forget how to use the software.  That's a draft, folks, or was supposed to be.  Alas, it's a hypothetical situation.  I'm still unpublished/unpublishable. 

One day, though, maybe congratulations will be in order.  For now, it's nongratulations all day, all night.

I didn't take it as an announcement, but as a satire. Nice one, too.

The ESPN-Academia coverage I'd \*really\* like to see:

Q: So, Scott, do you think the fans are going to support the upcoming walkout over academic salaries?

A: You know Bob, I think they'll understand that $11 million, for what we do, it's ... with these salary caps, you can't build a good team, develop a deep bench ... and  to really be competitive you need top psychoanalytic critics to balance out your Deleuzeans and your new historicists ... it's worth it. This is a grand tradition we're talking about.

Q: That \*is\* true, Scott. Deconstruction is the great American pastime, like apple pie and invading small countries.

A: That it is, Bob.

I'd be happy if ESPN just covered women's golf.  (LPGA interviews are usually more fun to read than others are to watch, but they'd probably be even more fun to watch, given the mix of atrocious cliches and actually interesting comments in them.)

Don't you think there is something to the experience of "getting in the zone" with writing as well as with sports?  Or is that one of the things where you can see the sports results are actually good, but when you look back at the writing and only find two salvageable sentences you realize how much better it would be to be a professional athlete?

Hah!

If ESPN covered the MLA, it probably couldn't be any more ridiculous than the press coverage the MLA actually does receive. Except, of course, for [Margery Kempe's coverage](http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/2007/01/margerye-kempe-at-feest-of-mla.html), which can only be described as Truth.

God it would be awesome if academic conferences had things like charging the pitcher's mound and body checking. Great post Scott.

With preview and the pause for comment verification, you'd think I'd have caught that typo.

Damn it, Floyd, I'd return your trash word-for-word, were it not for what happened to the last guy who did it.  (Who, by the way, won that fight in the eyes of impartial observers.)
