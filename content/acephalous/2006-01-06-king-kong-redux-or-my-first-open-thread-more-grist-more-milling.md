Since many people seem disinclined to add additional weight to the already (and appropriately) massive Kong comment thread, I hereby create another in which you may discuss [the grist your mill can't refine](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/king\_kong\_the\_s.html).

Oh, I don't know, Scott.  The whole _King Kong_ discussion already seems so _this morning_.

Nonetheless, can I suggest that the film really does complicate the line about beauty killing the beast?  The parallel Skull Island/ Empire State Bldg vistas suggest that Kong was seduced as much by lovely sunsets as by a pratfalling Naomi Watts.  Elaine Scarry, white courtesy phone.

Given that I've been reading about operant conditioning all morning, I'm tempted to think of Skull Island and Manhattan as giant Skinner-Boxes with sunsets and/or Watts as the discriminitive stimuli.  I'm not sure what the actual reward is, but I imagine it's spectacular.

My questions is, would we respond to Kong differently if instead of a male gorilla he had been a giant female golden retriever?

Michael,  

so the view from the top of the respective peaks is just as pretty as Naomi Watts.  Either way, he's still killed by "beauty".

But in the end, isn't this thread just perpetuating the myth that this remake was good?  I think we should end discussion of the movie before Peter Jackson gets the idea that he should waste another three hours of my life.
