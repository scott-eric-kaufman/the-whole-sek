[cross-posted over [yonder](http://www.thevalve.org/go/).]

As most of the Valve’s contributors are holed up in the places
they hole up when deadlines press (West Hollywood), I thought
it’d be a good time to discuss procrastination.  Academic
writing’s [Pretty Hard, Dammit](http://prettyharddammit.blogspot.com/); procrastination’s so easy I can do it _while I write the very words you’re reading_.  I’ve two points to this post, and I may even get around to them both, so here goes:

First, I’ve noticed that the majority of [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) bloggers blog anonymously.  (If you browse the rolls over at, say, [Bitch Ph.D.](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/)
you’ll find an almost one-to-one correspondence between platform,
Blogger, and anonymity.) Why would thoughtful and intelligent bloggers
wish to remain anonymous?  I could understand if the point of your
blog were to document the daily stupidities of the undergraduate
population at the university of your employ; but if you’re
discussing academic matters in a civil, appropriately academic tone, I
don’t see the point of anonymity.  Am I a naive
future-litigant and/or professional adjunct?  Should I consider,
as I jested earlier today, [stuffing the cat back in the bag](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/stuffing\_the\_ca.html)?  (Lest anyone think I’m the least bit literal, I [assure](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/images/photos/weeboys.jpg) [you](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/images/photos/theboys.jpg) [I](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/images/photos/rachel.jpg) [am not](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/images/photos/finnegan.jpg).)
If I had to guess, one reason for the culture of anonymity is that it
provides the freedom to discuss non-academic or strictly professional
matters more frankly.  (_E.g._ You wouldn’t solicit
advice on whether to accept an offer from another institution or
discuss your personal, medical, mental &c. issues if you blog under
your actual name.) But I don’t trust what I hazard.  On
principle.  _Sound_ principle.  I welcome your input.

Second, I mentioned academic civility earlier, which is something
I’ve earmarked for a future post--or possibly series, as I adore [series](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/the\_a\_cephalous\_word\_of\_the\_every\_other\_day\_or\_so/index.html)--but want to mention, briefly, now:

Wallace Martin’s [“Literary Critics and Their Discontents: A Response to Geoffrey Hartman"](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-1896%!(NOVERB)
