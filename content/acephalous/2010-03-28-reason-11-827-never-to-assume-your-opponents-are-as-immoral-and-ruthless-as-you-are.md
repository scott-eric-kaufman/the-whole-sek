## Reason 11,827 never to assume your opponents are as immoral and ruthless as you are.

			You end up peddling conspiracy theories in which your "evidence" says more about you than the person it purportedly convicts, _e.g._ [this immoral lout](http://www.serr8d.blogspot.com/)'s [ruthless speculation](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/academic\_freedom\_for\_me\_but\_not\_for\_thee/#comment-1296120) about people not nearly as petty or spiteful as he is.

Some people really need to apply Occam's Razor more often. And Freud's Projector less.

_I missed the other 11,826._

Have no fear, they're all the sort of thing that's obvious to people who aren't inveterate solipsists.

_Some people really need to apply Occam's Razor more often. And Freud's Projector less._

Ahistoricality, "[Freud's projector](http://www.google.com/search?q=)" is a verifiable Google orphan.  When John Emerson shows up, he'll present you with an award.  (He's a collector of them, if I'm remembering correctly.)

Speaking of "evidence" and "ruthless speculation..."

I hate to sound so skeptical, but we only have Jeff's word that this email thingy with his old mentor ever took place.
