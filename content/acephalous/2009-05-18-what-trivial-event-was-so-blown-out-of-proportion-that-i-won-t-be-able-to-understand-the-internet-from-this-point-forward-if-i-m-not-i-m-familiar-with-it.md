## What trivial event was so blown out of proportion that I won't be able to understand the internet from this point forward if I'm not I'm familiar with it?

Because I'm exhausted and the odds of me catching up on 3,000 or so posts at this point in the quarter are slim to none.

Without a doubt, [Dowd](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/an-end-of-term-treat/).

On politics, [Rumsfeld](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009\_05/018220.php) (also, [Rumsfeld](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009\_05/018221.php)

Oh, and I just saw [this](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009\_05/018234.php), but it's definitely something you'll need to know when you dive back into the culture of the right.

Your sister [graduated](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/you-must-comment.html).

A slideshow of stuff being auctioned off [from Michael Jackson's private collection]() was posted.  Click the link and you'll see the reason 'auction' and '_awesome_' sound so alike.

Dowd: Wowed. I have been boycotting her because of her over-the-top fireworks during the election (and her bad, bad writing). But this gives my boycott a whole new dimension.

Of course, you'll also be interested to know that [England beat the West Indies by an innings and 83 runs, to wrap up a 2-0 series win](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/8055444.stm).

Adam beat me to it.  Your sister's graduation.

Solipsists of the world, unite!

First, I'm disappointed no one told me about that Toobin article.  Seriously, people, everyone's still talking about it.  

Adam, aren't the English supposed to, like, know English?  I mean, "an innings"?  What sort of bloody colonial fumbled number---wait, you mean to say that's the mother tongue twisting?  

nk, yes, let me tell you, yes.  Solipsists need to unite against the monstrosity that is the modern day commencement.  I've got something half-written already---basically about how if ceremonies like this are what I'm busting my ass so that these kids can one day attend/put their families through, I'm thinking it's time to get out of the game.

What Toobin article? Nobody's mentioned it to me?

(Though I'm not seeing formatting in comments again, so if you've linked to it above, just ignore this, and I'll find it eventually).

You should have come to Madison with us.  Although it may be that we were at the Doctorates' commencement (PhDs, MDs, DVMs, JDs).  The undergrads' commencement, which we did not attend, may have been as you say.

Notwithstanding what I have said at other times and in other places, SEK, there was a lot of truth in Alexander's "I have had two fathers.  My father [Phillip] and my teacher [Aristotle]".  Stick with it, SEK.  If nothing else, you are saving future generations from (metaphorically speaking) having to reinvent fire and the wheel.

What Toobin article? 

I didn't link to it because I assumed you'd already read it.  (It's the one on Roberts record since ascending to the Supreme Court, and everyone and their bloggers seemed to have written about it at some point in the past few days.)

You should have come to Madison with us. Although it may be that we were at the Doctorates' commencement (PhDs, MDs, DVMs, JDs). 

I didn't even go to my own doctoral commencement for fear of death-by-boredom.  I'm just not a big pomp and circumstance person.  I understand why other people are, and I do honestly celebrate their accomplishments, but I prefer to do it on my own time.

Stick with it, SEK. If nothing else, you are saving future generations from (metaphorically speaking) having to reinvent fire and the wheel.

At this point in the quarter, I feel like I'm just trying to stop them from setting failed wheels on fire, but that's probably because it's spring and I'm exhausted.

Ok, just one more and I'll shut up.  Erudition has served me well as a substitute for intelligence all my life.  And I could not have done it without my teachers.  Think of all the stupid people you'll be leaving stranded.
