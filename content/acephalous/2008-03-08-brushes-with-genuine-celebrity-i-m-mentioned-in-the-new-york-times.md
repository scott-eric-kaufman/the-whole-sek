Did you see me?  

No?  I'm right there in the 31st paragraph.  

Still nothing?  

Let me help:
There was also UnfoggeDCon, the [impromptu](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_8371.html#786568) convention in December 2006
of the Unfogged community. Becks heard that 
_**some bloggers**_
 were
traveling to Washington, and opened up the Flophouse for a party.

There I am!  I'm some bloggers!  

Off now to update my CV ...

You were missed, at the more recent incarnation this past December.

Ahistoricality, if Roth can be Zuckerman's famous alter, I can ... no, that's going nowhere good.  Better just to drop it.

Wish I could've been there, arthegall, but given the circumstances, I think I made the right decision.
