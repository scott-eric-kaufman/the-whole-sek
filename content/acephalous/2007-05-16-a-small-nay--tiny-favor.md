## A Small, Nay, <em>Tiny</em> Favor

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/a_small_nay_tin.html

If you read _Acephalous_ regularly but don't link to it, I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking a minute to do so.  You see, I'm giving [a presentation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/colloquiam\_on\_b.html) next week, and since it's about academic blogging, there's a chance people will want to experience for themselves The Thrilling Adventure That Is Academic Blogging ... and when they do, they'll learn that "I'm _**a**_ [terminal] Adorable Rodent in the TTLB Ecosystem."  I'd rather keep my pride, thank you very much.  

(For those of you who suggest that I should just delete that bit of code from my site, I would in an instant were it not for the fact that doing so would torpedo the evolution of everyone I link to.  Yes, guilt _is_ polymorphous, if not always perverse.)

As long as I'm indulging, I'll reiterate what [I wrote last week](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue\_blogwide\_st.html#comment-68514658): my kid sister thinks me a friendless schmuck because (as of two weeks ago) no one other than [wolfson](http://waste.typepad.com/) had "friended" me on _[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/)_.  Obviously, this isn't the case.  I'm _beloved_ by my adoring fans ... if only because I scare-quote "friended."  (Who doesn't love a stickler for grammar?)  Not that I'm all that concerned about this, mind you.  I just want bragging rights come Christmas dinner.

I'm confused; do we need to do more than put it in our blogrolls? I've linked to you in the past 180 days, etc., but I'm here to help.

Also, as a matter of factual record, _I_ friended Scott Kaufman a very long time ago, and it took him forever to accept the request. As I recall, the Little Womedievalist beat him to it by something like three months.

You're in the clear, Joe.  I'm just trying to evolve into a grammatical statement before next Wednesday.  

That said, I'm a _horrible_ Facebook friend; moreover, as someone reminded me tonight, my exclusion of all those of the feminine persuasion who have friended me is insulting in the extreme.  I should've specified that I only get dinner table-cred if my friends are 1) guys, 2) single and 3) cute.  (According the standards set and upheld by undergraduate women like my kid sister, of course.  I have no dog in this fight.)

You're out of luck from me, Scott.  A request for hundreds of comments falls into my area of expertise, this doesn't.

Granted, though evolution-by-request is a bit cheaty, don't you think?

Humbug, Hermit Greg, humbug.  I was a "Large Mammal" until their servers crashed a few weeks back, and now I've been devolved ... plus, with over 1,500 people reading this site daily, I think I deserve something better than a grammatical error.  Also, remember, _THE GUILT, THE GUILT!_  If I kill my TTLB account, I take others down with me.  In evolutionary terms, this is actually interesting ... but I won't bore you with that sort of nonsense.\*

\*By "nonsense" I mean "material vital to the completion of my dissertation, my ignorance of which compels me to cry myself to sleep every night."

If facebook allowed silhouettes I'd join and friend you.

Facebook does allow silhouettes, yes? Post a picture of a silhouette.

They police some things, but fortunately not that.

Well, then, if it's _re_evolution, I _guess_ it's _okay_...

Hey, dude, any reciprocity in this deal?  I, like, have you on three blogrolls.  I'm fighting to avoid grammatical error myself (as in "a insignificant microbe") and now you remind me it's not the only one in the ecosystem, even.

What I've always wondered is why they can't just change the code so that it says "an" instead.  It seems like it would be a relatively trivial change.

They're associated with Pajamas Media, after all.

Facebook? _Facebook_?

That's a no-fly zone for me so I can't give you massive brownie points with my well-endowed awesomeness.

Was for me too, Jake.  But then, you know, the _humiliation_.

Constructivist, you inspired me to update my blogroll ... or, "your wish is my command," as it were.

eb, what's interesting is that I changed my Facebook photo to the one in the upper left portion of this page, and I fully expect to be reprimanded for it.  Thing is, it's the photo I'm best known by, even if it is a headless Lenin.

Sorry, sir.  I don't go near _Facebook_. I'll mention you to the group of literate adults with whom I associate on LiveJournal, if that'll do you any good.
