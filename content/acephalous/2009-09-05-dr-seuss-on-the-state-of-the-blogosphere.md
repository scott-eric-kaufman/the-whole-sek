(_Being a slightly altered version of [my earlier parody](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/historical-novels-underrated-or-no-are-only-ever-incidentally-historical/#comment-52554) of [this beloved book](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/dreeves/Fox-In-Socks.txt)._)

What do I know about tweeting bloggers? Well . . .

		

					[]()
			

When tweeting bloggers fight,  
it’s called a tweeting   
blogger battle.  

And when they battle 'bout the future,  
it’s a tweeting blogger   
augur battle.  

And when tweeting bloggers battle   
over augurs in a muddle,  
they call it a muddled  
 tweeting blogger   
augur battle.  

AND . . .  

When bloggers battle bloggers  
in a muddled augur battle,  
and the tweeting blogger battle  
is about Barack Obama,  
they call this a   
muddled tweeting   
blogger augur  
battle 'bout   
Barack Obama.  

AND . . .  

When bloggers fight these battles  
over augurs 'bout Obama,  
and Obama’s being born  
in a Kenya or Jakarta,  
they call THIS a   
muddled tweeting   
birther blogger   
augur battle   
'bout Obama.  

AND . . .  

When Barack is being born  
in a Kenya or Jakarta,  
and the birther bloggers blog  
about Obama Mama augurs,  
and the dentist lawyer lady  
tells the muddled crying man,  
'bout the huddled battle tweeters  
massed along the Rio Grande . . .  

_Stop it!  Stop it!  
Shut your trap, sir!  
I can't listen to this crap, sir!  

FOX in News, our game is done, sir.  
It has been no fucking fun, sir._

Since you wrote this at the Edge of the American West first, doesn't it seem silly not to post it there too?
