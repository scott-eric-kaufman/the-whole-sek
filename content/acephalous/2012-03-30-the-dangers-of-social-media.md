## The Dangers of Social Media

So, um, hello new friends, and welcome to Scott's second-worst Jewish nightmare. See, Scott's new phone only came with a car charger, so he had to drive somewhere and being an English teacher, decided to go to the library.

While there, some punk added all y'all while Scott refreshed his water at the Corona public bottle refilling stations, and though he remembers you all with great fondness, because of all the wonderful memories he shared with each and every one of you, he's not sure you want to listen to his each and every joyous exclamation or deadening complaint–of which there are very, very many–and so if you decide to decline 'his' invitation, he will be in no way offended.  

In short, social media leaves no good ground for graceful exits, so here's Scott trying his best. (Yes, this is what that looks like.) That said, if you've a particularly good burn you'd like turned conflagration before declining his request, he'd love to hear/smell/asphyxiate because of it ... so long as you allow him (or his next of kin) to re-use it should a similar situation some day arrise.  

Best,  

Scott

P.S. More on [Pete and Peggy, as promised,](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/03/mad-men-sally-and-don-in-a-little-kiss) in "A Little Kiss," shortly. 

P.P.S. To [those](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/) who said "At least it wasn't about that other thing," remember that earlier in the week it was. _[Only literally](http://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman/posts/10100923874435081)._

You can un-friend me if you want. No biggie. :)

No worries. At this point, I just try to need to figure out how to re-privatize in a way that allows me to see what I want to see and not anybody's babies. That's basically it.
