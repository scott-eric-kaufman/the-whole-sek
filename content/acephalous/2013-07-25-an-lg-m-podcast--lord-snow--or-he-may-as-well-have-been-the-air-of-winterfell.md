[Steven Attewell](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/) and I decided that we didn’t want to wait until next February to continue talking about _Game of Thrones_,  and so we decided to start over. Here’s our take on “Lord Snow,”  the series’ third episode. And before you ask: yes, the podcast did explode before we had a chance to finish it. We'll cover the four minutes we lost in two weeks, after I've moved and settled in. Which also means, obviously, that there won't be a podcast next week, as I'll be moving and settling in. Try not to miss me too much.
Works SEK discusses:
