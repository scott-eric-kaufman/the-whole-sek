There was a post here.  Now there isn't.  What can I say?  

I'm mysterious.

What about the Vlaams Belang posts, Scott?

Way to add to all my job-market stress and fears, dude! Thanks. Thanks a lot. 

(And I never read unfogged because it all seems to be some giant secret in-joke. That and the comment threads can be massive.)

Is the now you see it now you don't an unfogged injoke?

(sisyphus, I don't know if you've seen [this post](http://jjcohen.blogspot.com/2007/11/on-market.html) by me, but if you're on the market right now, maybe you'd find something in it to ease your suffering)

Karl, it isn't.  To be earnest -- a trait banned on _Unfogged_ -- I may've misread things because I've got a very sick cat on my hands, and am in an odd, pre-mourning place.  That's why I pulled the post: I don't trust my own thoughts tonight, as they're liable to drift terribly morose.

Thanks for the link, Karl. I wish they held interviews at a Shriner's convention instead of the MLA! (little hats, hee!)

No, it was more like ... job-search ... hazing ... like being quizzed on details of an entire unfogged comment thread from memory in an interview ... something like that. 

SEK, I hope your cat --- named Ernest? --- gets better and that everything is ok with you and yours.

I know you did, Sifu, I know you did.  

Sisyphus, it's my Pynchon cat, Rachel Owlglass, who refuses food and water now, and whose blood work's inconclusive.  It's sad beyond the telling, to be frank.

No, not sick kitties! Very sad. If she's Pynchonian, maybe feed her some Imipolex-G? (ok, cheezy joke.)

I'm sorry to hear about your cat, Scott. 

[I'm also glad someone convinced you to become mysterious in this post, but that seems less important.]

Oh, jeezus, Scott, that sucks. My sympathy for you and this cat.

(Sisy: one of our job-market advisers at the alma mater suffered an interview where a superstar theorist thought he was the linguistics guy; he was (and remains) the early modernist guy, but he answered as many questions as he could. I think he wins the nightmare of nightmare interview story, as hard to imagine as it is)

I have a gift for catching on to in-jokes -- that's what makes me good at theology.

You know, another prominent pseudonymous blogger once toyed with this possibility on her blog. I wonder what she thinks about it now. I remember emailing her offline to say don't go there.

I can't stand people who can never be earnest about as much as I can't stand people who can never joke.

Cat illness is indeed very sad.  My family's cat got sick (with cancer, probably) and we realized that she was going to go, and I had to figure out how to explain it to a 5-year-old.  I was completely too much of a coward to go with the PZ Myers "let's bring your kids up with atheism from the start!" routine.  But I couldn't stomach Cat Heaven.  So I ended up with some kind of weird agnostic varient of Cat Reincarnation, justifying it to myself that at least it wasn't a religious belief that was oppressing people in our part of the world.  So the 5-year-old insisted that one of our two new kittens must be named the same as the old cat.  Well, he's happy with it, and so apparently is the cat, and any predeliction towards New Agism later in life isn't really the worst thing ever.

Oh dear. One's hands do get wrung out over a sick cat. Mine are being wrung right now in sympathy. Allow me to add my good wishes for Rachel Owlglass, SEK.

I'm sure you all have tried the usual tricks -- tuna fish, heated food, hand feeding.  Cats do change their minds about these things sometimes.  I hope all four of you will be alright.

Thanks for the support.  As the post above indicates, things look better, thankfully.

And Rich, I'm sorry to hear about that, but happy it worked out.
