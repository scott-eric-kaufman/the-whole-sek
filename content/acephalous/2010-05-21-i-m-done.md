## I'm done.

Not forever, but at least a week.  I'm not blaming the internet, but I also don't want to have a nervous breakdown on it.  I'm tired of being good-natured fodder for [Unfogged](http://www.unfogged.com/), but I don't blame that lot either.  I'm just _tired_.  At some point even people who are accustomed to the improbable cease being able to deal with it, and I think I may have reached that point.  

So:  





I'll see you in a week.  Maybe by then I _will_ have a secret chart to get to the heart of this or any other matter.

Take longer, if you need it. RSS feeds mean that we'll be here as soon as you're back. 

Be well.

What they said. Reading the post below, no wonder you're stressed; don't add more.

I assume that you've read [The Ecology of Fear](http://www.amazon.com/Ecology-Fear-Angeles-Imagination-Disaster/dp/0375706070)?  I thought it was quite good, as was City of Quartz.  It had the usual nitpicking campaign against it, but it's well worth reading.

I don't know which particular improbability is the camel's-back one, but the strength of this book is that it really got me to think about environmental probability in a different way.  Live in an area with a particular fire regime, and this kind of thing isn't improbable.  It's rather the opposite of improbable: it's inevitable.

One reaches that point. Takes a step back. Thinks it over. Some time goes by. One begins again.

And then... one reaches that point.
