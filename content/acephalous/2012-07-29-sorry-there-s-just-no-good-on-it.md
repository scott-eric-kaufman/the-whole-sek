## Sorry, there's just no good on it.

[_It appears the only site that had this available was scuttled in December 2010. I first read a version of this during my [BBS](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/tales\_from\_bwww.html) [days](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/07/i-hear-the-noise-about-thy-keel.html), but as you can tell from [DISADVENTURE!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html), [DISADDENDUM!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disaddendum.html), [DISMORALIZED!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/dismoralized.html), [DISINSOMNIA!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/disinsomnia.html), [WHARTON!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/wharton.html), [GRADING!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/grading.html) and [DISBELIEF!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/06/disbelief.html) the form stuck with me. It's an inspiring tale of nerd from a time when nerdiness lacked its current cultural capital. So without further ado I return to the living Internets the glory that is **The Tale of Eric and the Dread Gazebo**_.]

ED: You see a well groomed garden. In the middle, on a small hill, you see a gazebo.

ERIC: A gazebo? What color is it?

ED: (_pause_s) It's white, Eric.

ERIC: How far away is it?

ED: About 50 yards.

ERIC: How big is it?

ED: (_pauses_) It's about 30 ft across, 15 ft high, with a pointed top.

ERIC: I use my sword to detect good on it.

ED: It's not good, Eric. It's a gazebo.

ERIC: (_pauses_) I call out to it.

ED: It won't answer. It's a gazebo.

ERIC: (_pause_s) I sheathe my sword and draw my bow and arrows. Does it respond in any way?

ED: No, Eric, it's a gazebo.

ERIC: I shoot it with my bow. (_rolls for hit_) What happened?

ED: There is now a gazebo with an arrow sticking out of it.

ERIC: (_pause_s) Wasn't it wounded?

ED: OF COURSE NOT. IT'S A GAZEBO.

ERIC: But that was a +3 arrow!

ED: It's a gazebo, Eric, a GAZEBO. If you really want to try to  destroy it, you could try to chop it with an axe, I suppose, or you  could try to burn it, but I don't know why anybody would even try. It's a FUCKING GAZEBO.  __

ERIC: I run away.

ED: It's too late. You've awakened the gazebo. It catches you and eats you.

ERIC: (_reaching for his die_) Maybe I'll roll up a fire-using mage so I can avenge my Paladin.

FTR: It’s Sunday morning, and someone emailed me saying they’d read about it recently and remembered that I’d posted it to a listserv a few years back. It’s probably apocryphal, but it’s been floating around since before the Internets had colors, so it deserves some sort of recognition. If it's available, I apologize for not Googling, but really, it never hurts to re-encounter a seminal funny.

One of my favorites.

Here's an (Internet Archive) link to the page I used to have bookmarked, which has a little more context too it. Looks to have originated with one Richard Aronson.

Thanks for the attribution. I hope it's obvious I was trying to credit the original, not steal Aronson's thunder.
