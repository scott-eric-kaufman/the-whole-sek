A broken Mr. Dorrit, recently of Marshalsea prison, moved over the
French countryside.  Ensconced in his “snug corner,”
he

fell to castle-building as he rode along. It was evident
that he had a very large castle in hand. All day long he was running
towers up, taking towers down, adding a wing here, putting on a
battlement there, looking to the walls, strengthening the defences,
giving ornamental touches to the interior, making in all respects a
superb castle of it...

On the heels of last week’s discussion on [alternative histories](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/crypto\_communisto\_conflagration\_100\_guaranteed\_or\_happenstance\_and\_identity/), I’m inspired by China Mieville’s [_The Scar_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345444388/qid=1119292159/sr=8-3/ref=pd\_bbs\_3/103-0718353-4437452?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)
to ask a similar question about a similar speculative endeavour:
building castles in the air.  New Crobuzon’s one of the best
realized castle-in-the-air I’ve ever encountered.  Its
effectiveness, I’d wager, stems from the manner in which it seems
not to have been created but _evolved_.  I once spent three months in [Urbino](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/53\_urbino.html) and as soon as that city--with its [unreal angles](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/49\_urbino.html) and centuries old inhumanly steep streets of [inlaid brick ladders](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/50\_urbino.html)--seeps
into your brain, the obsession with cities as agglutinate as German
concept-nouns inevitably follows.  So it has.  (So much so
I’m even fascinated by Jon Jerde’s [excessively](http://www.wildnatureimages.com/images%!/(MISSING)041008-116..jpg) [colorful](http://www.photohome.com/pictures/california-pictures/san-diego/horton-plaza-1a.jpg) simulations.)  

For the sake of clarity, I’ll call these “evolved
cities,” as “representations of fictional cities earthed in
a faux-historical developmental process such that it’s as
compellingly complex and un-invented-seeming as Drieser’s Chicago
or Chandler’s Los Angeles” sounds deeply stupid.  So,
yes, literary representations of similarly “evolved
cities.” I’ve located a number myself, including Marco
Polo’s in Calvino’s _Invisible Cities_--although
I’m looking for fully realized cities, so Calvino can’t
really count--William Gibson’s suburb-on-a-bridge in _Virtual Light_; Gormenghast Castle in Peake’s _Titus Groans_ and _Gormenghast_; the Orange/Los Angeles/San Diego County mall-complex in Robinson’s _The Gold Coast_;
etc.  The unflattering way to phrase this request would be that
I’m looking for works which’ll foster the felt-immersion of
a fourteen-year-old’s first encounter with Tolkien or an
undergraduate’s first flipping of _Ulysses_.  

So come on already!  This is a p-a-r-t-y!  Your
quarter/semester/Monday’s done and what would you rather do than
discuss your favorite fictional environs?  Don’t tell me
you’re all off watching [_The Scholar_](http://abc.go.com/primetime/scholar/index.html).

A Highly Personal (and Possibly Inappropriate) P.S.: If
anyone’s ever figured out all the film references on John
Vanderslice’s [_Cellar Door_](http://www.johnvanderslice.com/html/lyrics\_cd.html)
and wouldn’t mind sharing them, I’d be forever in your
debt.  I’ve connected the obvious--"Promising Actress”
and _Mulholland Drive_ and “When It Hits My Blood” and _Requiem for a Dream_--but outside of the obvious I’m as dense as ever.
