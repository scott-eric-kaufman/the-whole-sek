Because it’s about time for [another](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/08/the-new-doctor) _Doctor Who_ post, here’s England [reminding](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2386315/Matt-Smith-spends-day-days-Peter-Capaldi-announced-new-Doctor-Who.html)
 Matt Smith that he’s going to be miserable when she’s gone and we all 
die alone. The caption to the above photograph, for example, reads 
“[a]fter his lunch Matt wandered around, ending up sitting on someone’s 
front step,” which is essentially a Yiddish insult. (My grandmother 
never actually said “you should wander around and end up sitting on some
 stranger’s stoop,” but I can easily imagine her doing so.) The Jewish 
futility doesn’t end there:

Matt seemed to blend into the crowd as he spent a relaxed
 day on his own, as passers by seemed oblivious to who he was. ["You 
relax like a nobody" or "You and nine men don't make a _minyan_."]

Matt didn’t seem bothered by the fact that he was spending the day by
 himself, wanting to work on his own. ["As you work so will you die."]

Reading over the script, Matt seemed to be considering the new part, 
as he tried to make a name for himself in Hollywood. ["Try to make a 
name for yourself different from mine."]

The 30-year-old chomped away on his sandwich outside the eatery, 
obviously not worried about being spotted. ["When you slobber away, only
 God's watching."]

The star seemed happy as he spent alone, moving on with his career in the US. ["May you grow up and live in Los Angeles."]

Which means that, yes, I may be the first person ever to pass time in Mississippi writing ersatz Yiddish insults.
