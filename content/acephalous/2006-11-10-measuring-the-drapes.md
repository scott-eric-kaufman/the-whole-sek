## Measuring the Drapes

(
_x-posted from the Valve)_

_Vis-à-vis_ some [recent](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/mark\_bauerlein\_on\_michael\_berube\_canon\_fodder/#12810) [remarks](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/washington/09sketch.html), I feel compelled to ask: 

What do “taxpayer-financed ‘women’s studies’ caves” look like?  Nice
curtains or modified bed linens?  Shelves clawed from the walls?  Rows
of unalphabetized feminist literature?  Piles of _New Yorkers_ from 1996 strewn about the floor?  

Why are all these feminist troglodytes so _primitive_? 

“Backwards”?  What do you mean, “backwards”?

They are primitive because they are taxpayer-financed. Under the ownership society, the silhouettes of which are visible by the light of the flames generated by taxpayer-subsidized alternative energy resources burning on the dirt floor, the women's studies caves would be transformed into plush, privately-funded quarters known, perhaps more familiarly, as "tanks."

It must say something about me that the first cave that came to mind was the Batcave.

I wonder if women's studies caves have women's studies poles? Poles which the mild mannered woman slides down to tansform into **Super Feminist**!

So...many...bad...jokes...

...must...resist...urge...must...not...black...out...

...must...not...black...out...

(_winks out_)

Where am—what does this mean?  Where's my pudding?

(_winks out again, but before fading fully, promises to return with the mega-mega-response to the idea of "women's studies poles," one which will incorporate [awesome, barely-disguised hero-worship-type Batman-lore](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/a\_dreamed\_inter.html)_.)

Probably some of the same jokes I was thinking of while writing that comment. 

They'll be coming for my feminist card any moment now.
