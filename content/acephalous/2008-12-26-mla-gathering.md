I'm so far from the popular kids table I don't even know whether all the cool bloggers arranged an MLA gathering and _somehow_ neglected to invite me, but if they did (or didn't), and you're in San Francisco, we should do something.  (You know, to commemorate the power of the e-volution, may it R.I.P.)

I'm up here!  (I live up here!)  And I know there's a UCI English department thing on Sunday evening (e-mail for details?), but I'd also be interested in a bloggy gathering if one takes place.  (Even though my blog is completely fallow at this point…)

It's as if the Valve decided to sit this one out.
