## This does little to instill confidence in MBAs.

This is the Paul Merage School of Business at UCI:

[![Merage-building2](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115701c540b970b-500pi "Merage-building2")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115701c540b970b-pi)   


At the end of this walkway there is a single, terrible step that extends [the length of the building](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalramble/293587611/in/set-72157594368777117/).  At least I assume it must be terrible, because sometime last quarter they painted that step bright yellow, like so:

[![Step01](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115701c58c2970b-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115701c58c2970b-pi)   

Though drastic, this measure failed to alert these budding titans of finance to the existence of the step.  One can imagine them tumbling like [Wojnarowiczian buffalo](http://www.markallencam.com/DavidWojnarowicz.jpg) off that 12-inch cliff into a valley strewn with the detritus of the upwardly mobile (a cracked iPhone here, a smashed PDA there).  So in order to save the MBA from extinction, someone did some anti-[Magrittian sloganeering](http://enculturation.gmu.edu/3\_2/images/magritte1.jpg) at the walkway's end:  

[![Step02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f25ae9c970c-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f25ae9c970c-pi)   


  
Alas!  Still the former [Future Business Leaders of America](http://www.fbla-pbl.org/) tumbled to their twisted ankles!  How do I know?  Because of what I saw when I walked by there today:  

[![Step03](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115701c6f9c970b-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115701c6f9c970b-pi)   

  
Every few feet _the entire length of the building_ this step announces its existence.  Perhaps now these geniuses can stop worrying about their walking and get back to saving our economy from themselves.

I'm in the process of starting a social experiment via the web, and am in need of someone that can write really well.  The details of the project is laid out on my website at [_I'm not about to let that stand, no sir---The Management_]. I'm looking for someone that can edit the content in a more easily understandable format.  Please visit the site, and contact me if you or someone you know might be interested in participating in the project. Thank you.

PS.  This is NOT a paid position; I'm looking for like minded individuals who are interested in making this prjoect become a success.  Thank you.

Silly spam, who would accept an _unpaid_ position in a company that, well, wants:

To successfully develop, create, and operate a FOR-PROFIT business entity that will operate as an emergent computational device, through a structured organization of people that will attempt to systematically help alleviate many of the social challenges facing the human race, while generating profits for its shareholders by encompassing the following tenets . . .

Also, if you're going to spam multiple blogs---this comment was also posted on _The Valve_---you may want to correct that typo, lest someone think your "hiring" practices a tad undiscriminating.

I wonder if each iteration of .... nannyism? what's the word for this sort of nattering protectionism? ... was inspired by an actual injury (and if they were to different people each time, or one disturbingly oblivious and self-injuring soul?) or by some shifting building code or lawerly discussion?

Conservatives favor the term "nanny statism," but given that this seems a much more local matter, I have my doubts.  Not that they wouldn't complain, mind you.  Right now they're upset that the current administration has labeled white supremacists as people who might try to assassinate Obama.

What amuses me about the whole thing isn't the behind-the-scenes legal wrangling, if there is any, but the cautious gradualism of it.  They continued in their least-possibly-cynical alterations before finally conceding that nothing short of full-bore sensory announcement of the imminent step would suffice.

Well, if you assume that every 150 years, there will be one person who manages to trip so badly that they die of a head injury, and that the presence of a warning will reduce this to once every 300 years, then you've saved some fractional number of potential YPLL65 (years of potential life lost before 65).  That works even if you've never had a fatal accident, because based on the accident-proneness of people who do trip on it, there could be one.  Maybe you could calculate your best order-of-magnitude guess at the fractional life-years saved by each STEP.

Then again I once amused myself by trying to calculate the local kiddie train's (very small gauge, but large enough to ride on) rate of number of decapitations per year.

Then we're talking about some world-historical improbably unfortunate incidents---which are, as anyone who reads this blog knows, par for the course at UCI---having taken place in the past four weeks, because these are . . . 

. . . wait, people out there _calculate YPLL65_?  I think I might need to lie down.

Heh. 

Someone _could,_  you know, go over there one night and helpfully label everything else on the building: DOOR, WALL, LAMP, INANE BUSINESS STUDENT, etc. 

Or someone might conceive of a little guerrilla performance art consisting of human statues, chalk outlines, and crime-scene tape. Just sayin'...

I fear that this is not so much a sign of the incompetence MBA students (incompetent though they may be), so much as their litigiousness.  How many of them were thinking that they could pay for their entire business school tuition and generate some nice start-up capital just by taking a little tumble in their final year. That's the sort of thinking that business school teaches you.

_Someone could, you know, go over there one night and helpfully label everything else on the building: DOOR, WALL, LAMP, INANE BUSINESS STUDENT, etc._ 

Must.  Resist.  Urge.  Must.  Resist.  Urge . . .

_Or someone might conceive of a little guerrilla performance art consisting of human statues, chalk outlines, and crime-scene tape._

One day I should take that camera-phone I don't own and shoot some pictures of the Happy Chalk scrawlings all over campus.  No chalk outlines, just declarations of love to chalk.  A typical walk from Humanties Hall to Bio Sci III (where my office is understandably located) consists of some variation of this narrative:

"Hey, someone left some chalk here!"

"Did you say chalk?  I LOVE CHALK!"

"CHALK MAKES ME HAPPY TOO!"

"What should we do with chalk?"

"I think we should make OTHER PEOPLE as HAPPY as CHALK MAKES US!"

"GREAT idea!"

"What do people LOVE as much as we LOVE CHALK?"

"People love DOLPHINS!"

"As much as we LOVE CHALK?"

"Probably not.  But who loves ANYTHING as much as we LOVE CHALK?"

"NO ONE!"

"SO LET'S GO WITH DOLPHINS!"

"LOOK AT THE DOLPHINS PEOPLE! AND BE HAPPY!"

_How many of them were thinking that they could pay for their entire business school tuition and generate some nice start-up capital just by taking a little tumble in their final year._

You mean they'd rather score a quick buck than earn an honest living?  By George, that's, um, why do they have such a high opinion of themselves?  And why do they always express it in the basest behaviors?
