## Classroom as viral incubators; or, Where is SEK?

Crawling out of a Kleenex box, thank you very much.  (And by "you," I mean, "my students," who through no fault of their own have knocked me down three of the past three weekends.  Honestly, classrooms act as incubators for all 110 strains of human rhinovirus.  After not teaching last year, I suppose I'm now susceptible to all of them.)  Responses to comments and new posts will appear shortly.

You should try teaching high school, where you get to see the little carriers, er, students, every day and frequently have to touch papers, books, pencils, etc. on which they've had their snotty little fingers.  During the year that I taught high school, I was constantly sick.  Classrooms are cauldrons of contagion.

On the bright side, though, I think my exposure to those diseased darlings upped my resistance to some things.  I rarely get colds anymore.  Of course, that small gift in no way makes up for the horror of teaching the miscreants I taught, but that's a different story for a different time.
