## The "Woman's Order" (In Which No Scrotiform, Peniform or Other Objects Suspensory Appear)

Observing the unfortunate commonalities of the past posts, A. Cephalous determined to face down his dilemma.  He could not continue to publish material which contributed only to the education of a singular type, given to brood for days over an imaginary grief and substantial whiskey before waiting, always round the corner, often with a knife, but more often with a pistol, to revenge the insult by the dry light of _delirium tremens_.  A. Cephalous understood such men could not analyse an idea, much less conceive of admitting two, and willed himself an education anew.  He would, as he must, file this broadsheet from education's backside under: 

**Miscellany Acquired Reading [_The Education of Henry Adams_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0940450127/qid=1111799567/sr=8-4/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i1\_xgl14/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) When He Should Have Been Grading.**

Major General Benjamin F. Butler occupied New Orleans in April of 1862.  Shortly thereafter Confederate sympathizers began to organize.  Any sign of Union forces compelled this  elite cadres of [Confederate insurgents](http://www.gownsbysimpleelegance.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/EL8448small.jpg) to contemptuously gather in their skirts, cross streets, flee rooms, cast hateful glances and make derisive comments.  Gen. Maj. Butler countered these public displays of bitter resentment by issuing General Orders No. 28:
_As the officers and soldiers of the United States have been subjected to repeated insults from the women (calling themselves ladies) of New Orleans, in return for the most scrupulous noninterference and courtesy on our part, it is ordered that hereafter when any female shall, by word, gesture, or movement, insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States, she shall be regarded and held liable to be treated as a woman of the town plying her avocation."_

I scanned this entry instead of reading it at first (I'm hyper, what can I say?) and when I saw the first line of that communique, I instantly went, "Butler in New Orleans!"

Thank you, brief phase of intense fascination with the Civil War.

"Brief phases of intense fascination" describes to the letter the impetus for 99%!o(MISSING)f what I write here.  It heartens me to know that my enthusiam is contagious; after all, what's good communicating if what you're saying's not communicable?
