Ann Coulter has [an interesting column](http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2013-07-10.html)
 on the George Zimmerman case — and I say “interesting” because its sole
 concern is to indict Trayvon Martin for crimes committed by “young 
black males” who aren’t him. They may not even be themselves. To wit:

A few days later, another house was burglarized. The 
thieves made off  with jewelry and a new laptop. Roofers working across 
the street had  seen two black teenagers near the house at the time of 
the robbery. When  they spotted one of the teens the next day, they 
called the police.

This time, the roofers followed the suspect so he wouldn’t get  away.
 The cops arrived and found the stolen laptop in his backpack. This  was
 the same black teenager Zimmerman had seen looking in a neighbor’s  
window.

I understand how the roofers could recognize one of the people they 
saw “near the house,” and that the police could positively identify him 
as one of the robbers because he’s in possession of stolen property. But
 how exactly does Coulter know that the black teenager arrested with the
 laptop is the same one Zimmerman saw? Especially given that—if _nothing_ else—this trial’s proven that George Zimmerman is utter shit at 
identifying and assessing the relative threat of young black males. 
Given that this unnamed black teen was presumably convicted on the 
strength of the possession charge, from a legal standpoint it’s 
immaterial whether Zimmerman testified against him. But given the 
perspective of his current defense strategy—which amounts to him 
having been “socialized” by young black criminals to assume that all 
young black males are criminals—it seems odd that Coulter would defend
 Zimmerman by demonstrating that his profiling is vindicated. “He may be
 a racist who believes all young black males are criminals,” she 
essentially argues, “but Trayvon Martin was exception, and as a 
vigorously law-abiding citizen, Zimmerman had no choice but to abide by 
the rule.”

And here—and the following is graphic and I advise you not to click through if such things disturb you—here is what happens [when men like Zimmerman treat an “exception” like the “rule.”](http://gawker.com/this-courtesy-of-msnbc-is-trayvon-martins-dead-body-753370712)
 The defense has released countless images of a teenage Martin puffing 
his chest in his bathroom mirror like every other kid his age, but 
this is the image of Martin that matters. A young man, dead in the wet 
grass, his life cut short because Zimmerman mistook Skittles for a 
deadly weapon. The defense’s reliance on those images of Martin posing 
like a “thug” points to the perfidy of their logic: Zimmerman hadn’t 
seen those images when he started following Martin, nor did he know 
anything about Martin being involved with the insidious crime of 
enjoying marijuana. He just saw the kid who’d been in that dead body and
 decided he needed to be taught a lesson.

Say what you will about the legal maneuvering about lesser charges, 
but it’s clear that Zimmerman’s guilty of a premeditated action, and if 
his defense manages to convince the jury that “sensible” racial animus 
trumps that, we’re all the poorer for it.

**UPDATE:** And Zimmerman's [defense closes](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/12/zimmerman-lawyer-closes-by-showing-jury-shirtless-trayvon-photo/) with what Richard Wright, in a petulant interview with the French press, called a "behold _this_
 nigger" moment: a photograph of Martin sitting shirtless on his 
father's couch. It's just like a slave auction—right down to the 
selling of a black body.

"Vigorously law-abiding."

Wow. Apparently he vigorously abided Martin right into the grave.
