## How Professional Literary Critics Address Ambiguity in a Text (with Visual Aids)

My current problem is deciding which of the two conclusions I've written I'm going to append to the _Pudd'nhead Wilson_ chapter.  I don't mean "conclusions" as in "concluding paragraphs," either.  I mean "conclusions" as in "what I think Twain is up to in the final chapter _vis-a-vis_ race and American culture."  On Tuesday, I found a pessimism tinged with commonplace racism more convincing.  This morning, I'm inclined to consider his racism idiosyncratic and profound.   To aid others who may be in a similar plight, I thought I might diagram my pain for general 
amusement
 edification.

Coming to a conclusion in an academic essay is very much like looking at the red square pictured below.  Stare at it until it pops:

![Redbox01\_2](http://acephalous.typepad.com/redbox01.jpg "Redbox01\_2")

Now focus on the other red square until it does:

![Redbox02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/09/redbox02.jpg "Redbox02")

Then first again:

![Redbox01\_2](http://acephalous.typepad.com/redbox01.jpg "Redbox01\_2")

And the second:

![Redbox02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/09/redbox02.jpg "Redbox02")

Now both simultaneously:

![Redbox03](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/09/redbox03.jpg "Redbox03")

Until it turns into one of these things:

![Redbox05](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/09/redbox05.jpg "Redbox05")

This would be your argument.  It is unique and critical and it is genius.  Your timely interrogation of "box" will not go unnoticed.  The market rewards incisive interventions and yours will be no exception.

That double red square looks, to me, like a Tie-Fighter from _Star Wars_.  I'm sure _Star Wars_ deserves a place in your conclusion.  (_Race and American culture_ after all).

If your work has concluded does it mean you will walk for graduation?????  Your parents want to see it before they die of old age waiting for you to finish!!!!!  And your sister wants to make loud noises when you get that piece of paper so that she can justify going to grad school herself.

Yes, your thoughts betray you SEK. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... _sister_. So, you have a sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the Dark Side... then perhaps she will...

I think that you should put little Marcel Marceaus in the boxes. 

Just write a complex conclusion that leaves the answer to the reader.

Your use of 'box' is clearly a demeaning reference to the fact that I will not get tenure.

You'll hear from my lawyer.

But who decides which lines get drawn in red?
