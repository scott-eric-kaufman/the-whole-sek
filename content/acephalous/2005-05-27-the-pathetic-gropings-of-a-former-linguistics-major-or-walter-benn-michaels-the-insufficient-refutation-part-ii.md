[Note to Ray: The following may disturb you.]

[Note to Everyone Else: The following may bore you.]

[Note to Sean: I find this frustrating and fascinating.]

In my response Sean's [request](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/warning\_this\_is.html#comments) for more on my problems with Walter Benn Michaels' argument in _The Shape of the Signifier_, I came to the following fruitless conclusion:
what's at issue in debates of History vs. Memory is really a matter of
individual responsibility vs. collective trauma/guilt. Individual
responsibility can be historically compartmentalized, whereas
collective trauma/guilt necessarily extends to all members of the
collective, past, present and future. In political terms, collective
trauma/guilt subtends claims for slavery reparations; furthermore, it
focuses attention on the sins of the past instead of the inequities of
the present (and therefore botches the opportunity to hold contemporary
individuals responsible for the actions that've created/perpetuated
these inequities). I'm with Michaels there. I can see why the
representation of this continuity in literature would also--if we grant
culture this sort of formative power--have implications for politics at
large, i.e. dispense with the idea of collective guilt on television
and in books and movies and people might think differently. But even
though I grant culture the ability to shape thought thusly, I'm not
sure that sense of collective trauma and collective guilt could be
eliminated. Logically, and ideally, it should be; but I'm not sure it's
possible. Without saying that the capacity for this collectivist sense
is hard-wired, I'd say I strongly believe that it's a necessary
by-product of how humans have and will continue to interact. I realize
I've backed myself into a corner, because I not only can't explain why
I strongly believe that, I'm also well aware that I might only believe
it _because_ of the limitations imposed on my horizons by the
cultural moment in which they've been shaped. And, of course, short of
undertaking a [Gadamerian](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/082647697X/qid=1117217089/sr=8-1/ref=pd\_csp\_1/102-1563246-7465707?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)
intellectual history of the past 3,957 years, I can't responsibly
refute that latter claim. In short, I currently think that that is
necessarily true, but I can't substantiate that claim.

A couple hours later, I've devised a satisfactory way to talk about hard-wired models of historical continuity.  I'm going to avoid the claims of evolutionary psychology; that is, I'm not going to try to explain why the collectivist model is a universal human default.  Instead, I'm going to demonstrate, quickly, how language is built from the bottom-up and use that bolster the idea of an innate collectivism.  So...

...Benjamin Whorf came up with the whole notion of cryptotypes, by which he meant pretty much the same thing Chomsky does by deep structure; namely, a level of linguistic categorization that is not directly visible/audible but explains why a language behaves in a particular way.  One commonality of all languages is the dual inclusive/exclusive and plural inclusive/exclusive syntax distinctions.  They look like this:

1st person dual inclusive - "you and I"  
1st person dual exclusive - "he/she and I"  
1st person plural inclusive - "we two/three/four/etc. and you"  
1st person plural exclusive - "we two/three/four/etc. and him/her/them"

Clunky though these formulations are in English, in other languages these distinctions are ingrained into the nominal (and pronomial) morphology; not that that matters, as these would be cryptotypes in English anyhow.  Now consider verbal morphology: the difference between the caustive verb "kill" and the non-causitive verb "die" aren't captured so well in English, but in Samoan, for example, the causitive/non-causitive distinction is captured by a single morpheme; as if, in English "kill-o" meant "kill" and "kill-om" meant "die."  Nominal and verbal morphology interact to frame everything we talk about, what Talmy Givon calls a "hierarchy of topicality."  What he means is that certain combinations of nominal and verbal morphological interaction trigger particular (and statistically verifiable and, well, pre-verified) grammatical responses.  The basic distinctions in his hierachy are:

1) human &gt; non-human  
2) definite &gt; indefinite  
3) more involved participant &gt; less involved participant  
4) 1st person &gt; 2nd person &gt; 3rd person

As Alessandro Duranti explains, languages that "tend to separate human participants who are agents from human participants who are not...group the latter with the object of transitive clauses; hence _the woman_ in _the woman ran_ would be marked the same way as _the door_ in _the woman opened the door_.  Other types of languages might make other kinds of distinctions" (192).  These basic distinctions lead to preferred argument structures, and I'd wager, though I've yet to do the work to back this claim up, that the majority of languages not only capture family/clan/society distinctions but can be observed to functionally distribute them.  (Some of the linguistics who haunt these parts should chime in.  I'm working on the vague memories of my undergraduate days as a linguistic major, and in an attempt to avoid the slightest trace of evolutionary psychology or linguistic anthropology, I fear I may've veered into some irrational abyss.)

A couple of things I'm not saying: 

1) that language determines reality or The Real or what-not

2) that these deep structures make certain thoughts impossible to think; Michaels couldn't make the argument he makes if that were the case

3) that these deep structures make certain thoughts _easier_ or _more likely to be thought_ (though I may land somewhere near that position in the future)

Not that I'm obsessing, but I'm going to think about this more and edit this, that and the other sooner than later, and maybe even start a new series called The Statistical Improbability of Walter Benn Michaels Being Correct or something less inflammatory and more respectful...

I think you're right that some sense of group membership is omnipresent and ingrained in language.  But you haven't made the leap yet between this collectivist sense and Benn Michaels critique of the notion of historical trauma.  I.e., just because one is conscious of belonging to a group doesn't mean that one believes that one has been permanently marked by the history of that group in a Faulknerian or Morrisonian way.  For example, I'm conscious of being a Canadian and a liberal (in the sense that I hold to liberal ideals, not in the sense that I vote for the Liberal Party, since I don't) and identify, to a certain extent, with other liberal-minded Canadians, especially in relation to those wacko gun-totin', bible thumpin' Yankees down South.  But I don't think I've been permanently marked by the war of 1812 or indeed any event in Canadian history.  This, however, is a bad example.

A better way of getting at Benn Michaels might instead be to just turn to the evidence of anthropology - i.e., the fact that some, but not all cultures do have some sort of notion of collective trauma or collective guilt built into their culture.  It might be interesting to empirically explore the conditions under which this kind of notion does and does not arise.  It doesn't seem to be just a recent identity politics thing.

I'm headed in an anthropological direction.  Duranti, quoted above, is the author of [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521449936/qid=1117300943/sr=8-1/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i1\_xgl14/102-1563246-7465707?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).  My overall point is that I think Michaels' polemic a useful corrective to certain political positions, but ultimately it's only polemical and only useful, as opposed to a position that could itself be sustained.

Maybe what I was just trying to get at is that there are two separate questions: 1) Benn Michaels's reductio ad absurdum on identity politics and notions of collectivist identity, collective trauma, etc., all of which seems pretty sound - kind of like marching into Salem circa late 17th c. and saying - look, folks, believing in witchcraft is stupid.  2) The empirical fact that these beliefs do exist, that belief in collective trauma is typical of certain beliefs that occur again and again in different cultures, that it fulfills certain basic needs and that probably no amount of rationalist argument will make it go away.  Although maybe it might get out of literary studies; one can only hope.

All of which I think just repeats your argument, Acephalous.

I believe that Chomsky abandoned the phrase "deep structure" in the early 70s or so out of despair about how it was being used metaphorically.

Lyle Jenkins' _Biolinguistics_ is a fine book, I think, and one that you might find useful if you haven't already read it.

What about Habermas and his "Communicative Ethics"?

Jonathan,

I'll check it the next time I head to campus.

Simstim,

I actually know precious little about Habermas.  Stephen, on the other hand, knows quite a bit.  Care to explain, Canadian?
