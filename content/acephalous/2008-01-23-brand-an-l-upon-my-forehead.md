## Brand an "L" upon My Forehead

About that [earlier post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/notes-for-futur.html) ... [I'm an idiot](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/notes-for-futur.html#comment-98322044).  Ruffled my feathers in defense of [Kugelmass](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/) when the boy [victimized himself](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/parodying-academic-blogging/).  The particular beauty of this incident is that [I commented](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/parodying-academic-blogging/#comment-19348) on the very post responsible for the ruffling.

(In my defense, I had slept [neither soundly nor well](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/rachel-kaufman.html) at that time.)

Not to be mean, but this whole thing would have made a great addition to the satire...

WTF are you satirizing? You're making the Unfogged in-joke threads look transparent.

'L' for ... 'London-scholar'?

"Loser," actually.  But I appreciate you thinking the best of me, Adam.

John, click on the link to Kugelmass's post.  It was included in a satirical publication circulated, but I thought Joe was being mocked and defended accordingly.  (Because I am silly and a dullard.)

And then it takes a really long time to figure out what this post is apologizing for if you didn't read the comments on the earlier post.

Did I not say I was a dullard?  O ye of too much faith ...
