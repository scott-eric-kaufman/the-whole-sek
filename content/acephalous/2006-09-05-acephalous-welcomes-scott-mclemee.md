## Acephalous Welcomes Scott McLemee*

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/acephalous_welc.html

_Acephalous_ is pleased to welcome [Scott McLemee](http://www.mclemee.com/) as its newest contributor.  Scott's work has appeared in the _New York Times_,  the _Washington Post_, _The American Prospect_, _Bookforum_, _The Common Review_, _The Nation_, _Newsday_, _Salon_, the _Village Voice_, and elsewhere.  He has been a contributing editor of _In These Times_ and _Lingua Franca_, a senior writer for _The Chronicle of Higher Education_, and is now Essayist at Large for _Inside Higher Ed_, where his column, "[Intellectual Affairs](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/intellectual\_affairs)," appears twice a week.  I’ve known of Scott (though we only met this past December) since the late 1980’s, when I was in third grade.  I
suspect that I am (in both respects) one of the earliest admirers of his work, many of his
early articles having been published in journals and magazines which I
used to sell at my lemonade stand, and of which I was one of very few readers who colored in _all_ his articles!  

Via email, Scott sends along this response:
If memory serves, Scott [Kaufman] first suggested joining _Acephalous_ about  three years ago.  At the time, _Acephalous_ didn't exist; still, I declined, as I was at the _Chronicle of Higher Education,_ which proscribes its staff from appearing on the masthead of another publication.  Early last year, the founders of _Inside Higher Ed_
approached me with the chance to work a lot harder for a lot less money—an irresistible offer, since it also included perfect freedom in
deciding what to write about, and how.  (An alternative title for my
column, "Intellectual Affairs," might be "Pygmy Polymathy.")

In any case, the freedom to roam included the option I'm exercising
now, at long last, in joining _Acephalous_—a site that has been part
of my daily reading routine since before [Kaufman] founded it ...

At this point, his email descends into praise so effusive I can't publish it here.  Needless to say, we here at _Acephalous_ are proud to add another Scott to our already illustrious roster.\*\*

For some reason, a couple of articles quoting me in France -- and lord knows how that happened -- gave my first name as Sean. Maybe we could work something out.

I am pleased to join Acephalous as part of my extremely slow drive to global domination. After that, solvency.

You know, there's always some asshole whose jealousy drives him to mock other people's success.  Congratulations on being just that sort of asshole!  Have a nice life, loser.

I should explain to the anonymous party that Scott Eric Kaufman and I have been good friends ever since I helped him conceal the fact that he is actually the love-child of Nietzsche translator Walter Kaufmann. It was my idea that he drop the last "n" from his name.

Thought you were earnestly mocking McLemee, whose work I respect.  Tone deafness strikes again.  Please delete the first comment.  Thanks.

Fortunately, Michael convinced me to tack it back on.

No worries.  "Your" retraction is noted, but deleting it would ruin Scott's punchline, so it's staying.  (Plus, we don't discriminate against the "deaf" around here.  _All_ the deaf can frolic on Acephalous.  No one judges you here ...

You open a bracket before 'Please', but you don't _close_ the bracket.  Is that indicative of your 'standards' of 'journalistic writing'?  is it?  Eh?

And don't think of sneaking into your last comment and sneakily adding a close-brackets, or that will ruin _my_ punchline.

As for deafness, what can be said except: pardon?

No you don't.  You open a bracket before 'Plus'.  What am I talking about?  Argh.

This is all extremely controversial and polymath.  By which I mean it is befuddingly subtle.

Scott has just added the extra "n" to his name so that people will think that he's the guy Bérubé acknowledges in his new book.

I'm given to understand that the second printing will include "Scott Eric Kaufmen" in the acknowledgments.  Consider this a friendly heads-up, should you want to change your birth certificate, bank account, Social Security card, etc.

"Kaufmen"...heh, does this mean that I, the Kaufwoman, am also acknowledged in second printing of said book? (Am I married to a multiplicity of voices, or just a number of Scots...er, Scotts?)

You've commented on the misspellings of your name so often that I'm now confused about the number of n's, whereas I wasn't before. 

In my mind, the various Kaufmanns and Kaufmans in the world (including Andy Kaufman, who isn't mentioned often enough on this blog) are slowly beginning to merge into a single congealed persona that is equal parts philosophy, theory, comedy (intentional and otherwise), and three day's growth of facial hair.
