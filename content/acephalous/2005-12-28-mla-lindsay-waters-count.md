I have added an official "Lindsay Waters Count" to my posts on the panels.  

Why?  

Because his name has come up _multiple times_ at every panel I've attended.   

Why?  

Because everyone loves to love or loves to hate his most recent article in _The Chronicle_.  

Why?

I don't remember anymore.
