## On the Situation Outside of New Orleans; or, My First Angry Political Rant

I[](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/louisiana\_tmo\_2005242\_before\_1.jpg) had written a long rant about the deteriorating conditions in my home state of Louisiana.  I deleted it.  Too much worrying over issues like gun control now that they've become topical.  Friends of mine in Baton Rouge want to buy ammunition because they fear that the desperate evacuees from New Orleans may redirect their anger at the massive bureaucratic incompetence responsible for both the failure of the levees and the humanitarian crisis which followed.  Redirect it at whom?  

The nearest available target.  The family whose house was battered but not obliviated by the winds and the waves.  The person whose credit line afforded them the opportunity to purchase gasoline and escape ahead of the landfall.  The woman whose children and grandchildren aren't listed on the rolls of those missing and presumed (for now) unable to phone family and inform them they've weathered the storm.  In other words, _other victims of the massive bureaucratic incompetence responsible for both the failure of the levees and the humanitarian crisis which followed._

Then there are those who will suffer from future bureaucratic incompetence, like those refugees lucky enough to escape one submerged parish or another _only to be placed in a staging area in which riots between rival gangs from the Ninth and Seventeenth Wards have broken out.  Regularly.  For three days now._ Perhaps placing people who've already endured unimaginable psychological stress in the same temporary shelters with people who've endured similar horrors _but belong to rival gangs_ is less "bad idea" and more "criminal negligence."  It's not as if recent events and current privations would have these refugees working with triggers the adjective "hair" grossly overestimates.

This material is representative of what I had written in the other post.  Only not nearly so shrill.  Or outraged.  Or saddened.  Or worried.  

In this entry I've tempered my temper.  Refined my fire and been refined by it.  I've choked all indications that I might think that having idealists who refuse reality as a reference point may be no better suited to address this crisis than the one they've established in Iraq.  I'll probably delete this entry come morning, but I needed to vent.  And have now.  

Twice.

EDIT: Also outside of Louisiana--in Pass Christian, Mississippi, to be exact--a friend reports his __ parents' house was "looted" by armed men this morning.  This.  Is.  Not.  Good.  

EDIT II:  [_This_ is one evil and depraved looter](http://www.foxnews.com/photo\_essay/photoessay\_578\_images/looter\_350.jpg).

EDIT III:  I recieved a strange comment saying I should delete that second edit.  Either 1) he didn't realize how bitterly _sarcastic_ it was or 2) knows something more than I do about that particular looter and/or photograph but decided to be ambiguously menacing about it instead of sharing information.  So I'll give this person from Maine (so says the IP address) the benefit of the doubt and say that I only posted a link to that picture because it struck me that calling someone with medical and hygenic supplies a "looter."  If that person had a stash of CK merchandise elsewhere, I stand corrected _about this particular looter_ but not about "looters" in general (most of whom were "looting" supplies necessary for immediate survival).

That was actually pretty temperate for an angry political rant.  Send my best wishes to Justin, et al.

Not an angry rant, but a grieving one.  Loving the city as much as you clearly do, I trust you're more hysterical than this sounds ... 

Grief is deep water.  Anger is merely a ripple in it.

My work brings me into contact with emergency planners and firefighters, and this whole bungled situation is absolutely illustrative of where America is right now.  I mean, how smart do you have to be to send out the hospital ships not now, but before the storm reaches land?  Not very.  Yet it wasn't done.  

And is it purely Bush's fault?  In a proximate sense, yes.  But he is empowered not only by the moronic hordes of the religious right, but also by every libertarian who disdains managerial liberalism and talks up the market.  You want a free market?  You've got one in New Orleans right now, perfectly unregulated.  America is fundamentally unserious, from the conservatives who think that the most important thing is repressing sexuality, to the postmodernists who think that reality is purely socially constructed, to the blissed-out Republican pols who think that they can create reality; not one of them is an adult in anything but name.

And there are other completely forseeable catastrophes waiting in the wings.  Wait until avian flu hits.

I thought it was pretty temperate too.  It's admirable you could even be so.  The failure at local levels is atrocious, but the federal failure is exactly like they are about everything--I don't have the words for what they have uniquely become.  This proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Although since an object of disgust to many of us, Giuliani did give New York a sense of some way to get through it--the president was barely visible then either, working on using it for Iraq.  The 2 tragedies are physically different, of course, with 9/11 occurring in a relatively small area, not even causing much physical damage nearby, but this is so shameful and heartbreaking, in many ways the most disgraceful moment on American soil.

Like the others said--your POV is more than reasonable.  My best wishes to you, your family & friends.
