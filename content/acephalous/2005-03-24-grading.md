A Hemingway-esque explorer named Edward Premington addresses the Gentlemen's Hunt Club with stories of his latest African safari.  The Club is appalled as he describes the effects of the lion's roar: "You feel it first in your scrotum," Premington declares. "The hairs at the tip of your penis stand up.  The nipples on your ass become erect."  A member interupts him, saying "I must take severe umbrage at your anatomical logic," to which Premington responds, "I speak honestly, from the bottom of my vagina."  

The member tilts his head at Premington and asks, slowly, deliberately, "You...You don't know what words mean, do you?"
