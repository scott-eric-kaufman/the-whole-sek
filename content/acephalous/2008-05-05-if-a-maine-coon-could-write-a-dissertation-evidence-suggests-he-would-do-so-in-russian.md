From my Twain chapter:

What is he trying to tell me, [Mikhail](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/)?

I didn't know you had a Maine coon.  We picked up a lovely fellow in Ohio who we think is part Maine coon.  He started visiting us in the dead of winter, hanging outside the back door, visiting our two cats.  His nose was bloody, we took him in, and it's been love and tumbleweeds of lose fur since.

Thing is, he's not much of a typer.  His two brothers, on the other hand, are Microsoft Word experts.  They've managed to learn all sorts of shortcuts for deleting entire pages, for setting the margins at 1000 inches, for changing the font language, and for communicating such things as, "asdsdsddasdsdasd" and "jnjnkjjkjnjjknjnkjjk."  Even Joyce's cat could only muster a measely "Mrkgnao."  Then again, that was by longhand.

But my impression is that Maine coons are full of Christ love.  Ours is the living embodiment of non-violence (except to toy birds and insects) and cosmic sweetness.  He is full of Buddha Nature, even when his brothers leap on his back and try to ride him through the living room.

i'm glad you asked, Scott! unfortunately i can only help you out with a part of this clearly mysterious and significant message: 

ьььььььььь

this letter is a so-called "soft mark" that is added to a consonant to make the sounds, well, soft. taking that there are 10 soft marks here - something that is grammatically impossible yet strangely awesome - i think it means something like: "In light of the harsh realities of life, consider a softer, much softer, approach to it..."

Luther, sadly, my sweet Virgil's not full of Buddha Nature.  [In fact](http://acephalous.typepad.com/dadevil.jpg) ...

Mikhail!  Bless you for answering my quasi-insulting insinuation!  That said, yes, he is all about the sort, terroristic softness.  He lulls us into unthought with his silky softness, then suicide-bombs the medicine cabinet!  (Which he opens and ransacks himself!)
