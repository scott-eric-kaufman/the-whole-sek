## Help a Brother* Listen to Tunes

Now that I have desktop, I'm listening to music while I write.  Problem is, I'm endlessly annoyed by the fact that when I have _any_ player set to shuffle I'm forced to adjust the volume after _every single song_.  I've tried and failed to find a free player or plugin that will allow me to normalize the volume.  Suggestions?  

(Lest anyone suggest the Winamp toolbar as a solution, I've tested and deemed it a categorical failure.  Thing won't even tell me the name of the song I'm playing.)

There is a feature in iTunes that you can enable which brings every song's volume to the same line.  The only drawback is that it takes a hell of a long time to process.  If you have a lot of songs, just turn it on before you go to bed and let it run overnight.

[MP3Gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/) is what I use when I have this problem.

Um, iTunes.  Preferences, Playback, Sound Check.

MP3Gain is what I was looking for.  I'd try iTunes, but since I have a cheap knock-off of an mp3 player, I have to use (_gah_) Windows Media Player (although I have Winamp too, and use that when I play from the desktop).

Much obliged, all.

Scott, I know this post was for you and not for we the readership, but still I must protest that you're being a bit unfair -- you mention listening to music and even more tantalizingly mention listening to music while you write...   

what music Scott? and what relation between said music and your writing? Please don't leave us in suspense. (And in case you're wondering, no, the we here is not rhetorical: we the readership met, whoever could attend I mean, it was a sort of caucus, and I was elected spokesperson. I tried to get Rich to do it but he said Jo from the future wouldn't like that, that it would mess up Jo's dissertation or something, which I think was a bit disingenuous since I'm the one who has met Jo, not Rich, but Rich stuck to his guns and I'm not one to argue with a man with guns nor am I one to mess up anyone's dissertation [except my own, I reserve that right]. So again, please, don't leave us in suspense.)  

Yours for the readership,  

Nate
