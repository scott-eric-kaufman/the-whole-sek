## By that standard, we're all already everybody else.

			I understand from all my email that Jack Cashill has posted [another Obama/Ayers article](http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/10/what\_bill\_ayers\_saw\_in\_barack.html). I wonder what non-tendentious conclusions he'll draw this time?  

1.  Ayers and Obama both describe the crisis in the Chicago school system as "perpetual."
2.  Ayers and Obama both complain about increasingly larger educational bureaucracies.
3.  Ayers and Obama both criticize the "status quo."
In
short, the liberal politician and the liberal academics both air
liberal grievances. For some reason, Cashill finds this compelling. The
reason, of course, is that Cashill's not that bright. Need more proof?  

1.  Ayers and a '60s radical in Obama's book both bitch about the Man.
2.  Ayers and a '60s radical in Obama's book both think education is a tool belonging to the Man.
Cashill is actually _shocked_
by the fact that Bill Ayers, a '60s radical, makes statements similar
to those made by '60s radicals. He believes the fact that Bill Ayers, a
'60s radical, and other '60s radical use the same language to be _incriminating_.   

He must be the only person to watch a Cheech and Chong movie sober and wonder, on account of them talking so similarly, whether they weren't actually _the same person_.

Reading _Inherent Vice_ at 3 in the morning, I found myself thinking "Wouldn't it be great if 'Droolin' Floyd Womack' were some kind of allusion to David Foster Wallace?  Like, a tacit acknowledgment by Pynchon of a fallen fellow genius?"  The only small sad hope I had that this might be true was the fact that both had the initials "DFW", and the presumption that, ever since Farina's tragic young death, Pynchon has been sensitive to those who fall too young.  By 3:05 I even found this tribute from Pynchon to Wallace touching.  At 3:07 I emailed a couple of people with this idea.  By 8 the same morning, I was jeering at my brain's fanciful tromp back through the undergraduate predilection for sweaty, paranoid epiphanies.  A day later I was grateful my friends were (mostly) polite enough to simply overlook my gaffe.  Jack Cashill has shown again that, were I a mean go-getter, I'd already be on chapter 3 of my important new literary biography by now...

Please some anonymous punch Jack Cashill in the balls so I can ghoster-claim the punch.
