## You thought I was going to mock the title, didn't you?

Via [_Savage Minds_](http://savageminds.org/2009/03/10/winner-of-the-worst-postmodern-article-title-award/), I came across this article from the July 2008 edition of _Qualitative Inquiry_:

![image](http://www.thevalve.org/uploads/title02.jpg)

I know everyone wants to cry Sokal and loose the hounds of sense, but
the title is what the title is.  I’m more curious about this:

I was fortunate to be mentored by Corrine Glesne, an
absolutely wonderful ethnographer (Busier et al., 1997; Glesne, 1989,
1998, 2003; Martin & Glesne, 2002).

Do my eyes deceive me, or are those citations meant to substantiate _the absolute wonderfulness of Corrine Glesne_?  Is this a cheap scheme to up the number of times people are cited in professional indexes?  If so, how is it nobody’s—_wait a minute_.  I just had an idea.  

Have I ever told you how awesome you are?  I haven’t?  Well then, it’s about time that I did.  It is my _professional_
opinion that you are awesome.  By the authority invested in me by the
University of California, I hereby declare that each and every one of
you possess more awesomeness than anyone has any right to.  You can
quote me on that.  In fact, I insist that you do.  Every time you
appeal to your academic ethos, I’d like to see some variation of “Lest
you doubt my authority, remember that reputable scholars have attested
to my awesomeness (Kaufman 2009).” Feel free to practice in the
comments.

For obvious reasons, I will x-post this everywhere.  The more
citations I score, the more reputable I become; and the more reputable
I become, the more my stamp of approval’s worth.  I think we have
ourselves a win-win scenario here.  So what are you waiting for?  Start
practicing already!

I know we're not supposed to be talking about the title here...but what's the "ill"?  Is this in the slang sense of the word?  Or is it a prefix or other morphological fragment, like say for "illocutionary"?

It seems ok to me to say ill/elliptical, maybe even a little clever if all that other stuff was not muddying it up (even if I could not begin to say exactly _how_ it is clever) -- what fascinates me about that title is _re_pres©entation -- it makes me want to think it is formed out of a verb "represce" and I'm trying to figure out what such a verb would mean.

Scott, I've already been citing you in support of my awesomeness based on your talking up my Google Reader shared items the other day. I will of course add this post onto the footnote.

Also: "Cry Sokal and loose the hounds of sense" is just great.

This is a fantastic example of the [Poststructuralist Prose](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2009/01/comment-elsewhere-and-ten-rules-of.html) which I, in my awesomeness, preserved from print and brought to the web. 

What bothers me about it more than anything else is that I'm pretty sure I understand exactly what they mean. What does that say about [me](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2005/05/no-but-ive-dated.html)?

Because it's all about me.

Wait, though--aren't (most of) the citations that attest to Glesne's awesomeness Glesne?

Does that make it better or worse?

In slight seriousness, surely those citations must really be to papers that Glesne has been author or part-author of, right?  As a way of saying "Glesne is awesome because they've written these things."

Yeah, what you did is funny, but Dave and Rich have it right (the first citation appears to be [this](http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal;jsessionid=J75T2yYQcMJQpK7syJfLsydl2GH1bd1sl9M392LFDJyb477G2R0T!1232230115?\_nfpb=true&ERICExtSearch\_SearchValue\_0=%!B(MISSING)usier+Holly-Lynn%!&(MISSING)ERICExtSearch\_SearchType\_0=au&\_pageLabel=RecordDetails&objectId=0900019b80128408&accno=EJ584767&\_nfls=false)).  I've read some ethnography in my time and this is standard.  The use of "awesome" even in an acknowledgements section: less so.  Go see if UCI will let you retroactively edit it in to the diss.

Oh, I read it that Glesne wrote papers that said, in effect, "I'm awesome," and this person cited them as evidence of this fact.

Again I say, We sent you to college to learn this??? By the way are you walking for your PhD. We want to be in the crowd screaming "As last you are really done; now get a job.  This is said with love and pride in what you have accomplished.
