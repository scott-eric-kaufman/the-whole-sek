## I only mock the brilliant, responsible students. (And only when they ask for it.)

I apologize for the lack of posts lately, but since I sent in my  
absentee ballot, the election's lost a little luster for me. Turns out  
that voting ruins elections.

Go figure.

That said, look forward to much more on _Game of Thrones_ from  me in
 the near future. I've already written the posts, I just can't  publish 
them yet because my students are on to the fact that I post my  lesson 
plans _before_ I teach them, which has resulted in a truly frightening situation in which they _actually_ know everything I'm going to say before I say it. So I have to hold those back until after class on Tuesday. (_Grumble_ stupid students being responsible _grumble_.)

But  my students are still blogging, and they're producing all sorts 
of  interesting material. I assign them 1,000 words a week, 500 of which
 I  script for them via a prompt, the other 500 they're free to write  
whatever they want so long as it includes the course's critical  
vocabulary. Last week I covered the neuroscientific argument about [frontality](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm#54569), the short version of which [I discussed here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html#more),
  and now I have students who can't stop seeing faces everywhere.  
Including one particularly bright apple whose free post this week  
concerned _Prometheus_ in a very interesting way. He began by  
noting that the film opens with an intelligent designer ceding its DNA  
to fertilize the Earth—the pun was intended in the original—and that the  first scene in the film that includes humans opens thus:

[![prometheus00003](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/prometheus00003-300x125.png "prometheus00003")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/prometheus00003.png)

Seems
  innocuous enough, right? But according to my student, Ridley  
Scott—whose name is but an inverted "d" from being "Ripley Scott," as my
  student pointed out—wanted to remind viewers that this was a seeded  
world with this shot. How so? By including evidence of intelligent  
design in the rock features:

[![Prometheus00003a](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3ce60fff970c-500wi "Prometheus00003a")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3ce60fff970c-popup)

See how sad that rock is? [_See_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/prometheus00003b.png)? It's this sad:

[![Prometheus00008a](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c32b78654970b-500wi "Prometheus00008a")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c32b78654970b-popup)

Just tilt Mr. Intelligent Designer man about 35 degrees to the left and you'd have Mr. Sad Rock:

[![Prometheus00008b](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee45b4909970d-500wi "Prometheus00008b")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee45b4909970d-popup)

I'm  not sure I buy this argument—and strongly suspect that I may 
have  overplayed the frontality hand—but I can't help but admire the 
pluck of  this close-reading, especially given the fact that stretched 
as it  is, it does conform with the overall (and problematic) logic of 
the  film, which is all about, as the audience is informed immediately 
after  Mr. Sad Rock makes his appearance, the existence of "the same  
configuration" appearing across Earth and the universe. I informed my  
student that this was an impressively terrible argument—far too  
overdetermined to be correct—and he responded by saying I should put it 
out  there for others to decide. I warned him about what happens on the 
 wilds of the Internet, but given that he's taken legitimate points 
about  frontality and merged them with a solid accounting of the film, 
he  feels comfortable putting his theories out there.

So what do you think?

Sometimes a rock is just a rock.  In this case, because such rock formations are rather unusual, I think it is simply meant to evoke the pre-human landscape that we just got finished seeing.  In contrast with the millennia-old rock, however, the sudden presence of humans in the shot conveys (to me, at least) that they're almost intruders, or at the very least a surprising (miraculous?) addition to the mise-en-scene.

Yep, overdetermined. (See pareidolia.)

But since this student is looking for such things, surprised he missed the OBVIOUS 2001: A Space Odyssey protohuman head facing toward the sky just to the right of the Old Man of Storr (the spires). You've got the forehead, eyes, and the mouth slightly open in rapt awe of the universe. See it? (See pareidolia.)

I love the idea that the film might begin with a shot of a world planned by intelligent design, so kudos to your student for the idea.  I'd urge the student to look for other clues, though--the point about the face seems overdetermined.  Could he tone down the claim a bit?  One (very old) argument for intelligent design looks for evidence of construction and planning in the features of the natural world.  Perhaps the perfect "placement" of the rock features--the fact that they appear like sculptures that could not \*possibly\* have been produced by chance-- could be read as an argument for ID?

That said, I'd prefer that students overdo it rather than underdo it any day!
