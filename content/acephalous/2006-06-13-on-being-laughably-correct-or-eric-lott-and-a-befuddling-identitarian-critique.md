Academic advocacy has evolved little in decades since Joan Didion wrote [_The White Album_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374522219/diesekoschmar-20).  Issues of grave import outside academia still become the occasion for "an amiable evasion of routine, of institutional anxiety, of the tedium of the academic calendar.  Meanwhile the white radicals [can] see themselves, on an investment of virtually nothing, as urban guerrillas" (39).  The more things change blah blah blah.  Page-by-damning-page, Eric Lott's [_The Disap    ing Liberal Intellectual_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465041868/diesekoschmar-20) reminds us of this self-aggrandizing insularity.  So low are the stakes of Lott's argument against the "centering" of academic politics that he can barely be bothered to muster any real sustained critique of centrist politics.  In its stead he flings superficial insults against those who practice what he considers Popular Front-style compromising.  He calls it "[Boomer Liberalism](http://acephalous.typepad.com/boomer\_liberalism.pdf)" [.pdf]:
This powerful new liberalism, which fuses a newfound Popular Front sensibility to a crotchety dismissal of new social movements (particularly race-based ones), now confronts us as a force in dire need of an antiwhite, antistatist critique. 

Um, [Eric](http://www.engl.virginia.edu/faculty/photos/eric\_lott2.jpg)?  Stop with the bitter click-click-clicking already.  I know that's unfair.  But I'm merely borrowing a page from Lott's book.  He dismisses a conference at at the University of Virginia—which with dated wit he dubs "Rortypalooza"—on the basis of the color of its attendees: "Women and people of color from across the country were, for all intents and purposes, represented in the singular person of Spivak, the conference's designated scourge."  Am I to be blamed for turning his own fine-tuned argument against him?  For someone who wrote so compellingly about blackface in [_Love and Theft_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019509641X/diesekoschmar-20)—a [man whose bullshit detector is second-to-none](http://www.michaelberube.com/) [called it](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9831%!(NOVERB)
