If you Kaufmans had any common courtesy, you'd give the Dicksons the 911 spot.  It's just a little too you-got-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter to pass up.

That's because you don't spell it right.  It's Kaufmann, with two 'n's.  Or maybe Kauffman.  When I was a freshman, there were three off us in one class, one with each spelling.  We needed a Kauffmann to round things out.

Our numbers are falling, so, it is up to you to increase the numbers.  Perhaps you can rename your cats and list them as children and no one will know the difference.
