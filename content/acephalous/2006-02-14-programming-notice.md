_Please read and respond to [this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/a\_post\_in\_two\_p.html)
if you haven't already and have any interest in doing so.  I've
invested quite a bit of time today responding to criticisms of the
original post and revealing the hand I'll play in the article._ 

_Also: [This](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/do\_you\_believe\_in\_magic\_literary\_thinking\_and\_the\_new\_left/)
may have not been the best idea . . . but I can no more deny a
long-distance dedication than Casey Kasem.  So there you have it._
