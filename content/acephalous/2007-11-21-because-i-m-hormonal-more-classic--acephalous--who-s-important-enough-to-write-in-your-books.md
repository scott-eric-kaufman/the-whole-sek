## Because I'm Hormonal, More "Classic" <em>Acephalous</em>: Who's Important Enough to Write in Your Books ...

(_I've written or revised fifteen posts the past two days but lack the nerve to post them.  No doubt I'm developing a complex which will end in utter silence.  But what else can I do?  [Adam](http://www.adamkotsko.com/) ain't posted either lately [no doubt for better reason].  I could be introspective about this sudden involuntary reticence, but who knows what I'd find in the heart of fear.  [Certainly nothing worth blogging.]  I'm sure I'll recover soon enough from whatever this is ... unless this is THE END.  You know, THE MOMENT when you can no longer speak for sake of meaning.  But I don't think I'm on the point of silencing myself.  [Yet.]  This probably has more to do with my being hormonal because I've been without [levothyroxine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine) for two weeks now [THANKS [THIEVING LIBRARY](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html)!] and that's three times TMI and I'm going to shut it now.  Enjoy the rewind and pray for rain._)

My copy of Hardt and Negri's _Empire_ has an interesting history.  It begins in 2000, the year of its
initial publication, when Jim Ziegler (since tenure-tracked somewhere)
and I were discussing it in the "TA lounge," a.k.a. the round table in
front of the graduate student mailboxes ... which the faculty use as a
short-cut between the main English department office and the primary
graduate seminar room.  (And why shouldn't they?  It's their
department.)  So Jim and I are idly chatting about _Empire_ when [Julia Lupton](http://www.faculty.uci.edu/scripts/UCIFacultyProfiles/DetailDept.CFM?ID=2787) walks up, pauses, greets us, says something to Jim (I'm deaf, remember?) and then hurries off.  (Julia's an [important person](http://web2.hnet.uci.edu/hot/)
around UCI—a model academic whose standards I fail daily to live up
to—she's always hurrying somewhere, and with good reason.)  Point being:

Julia and Jim exchange words both assumed I could hear.  I couldn't,
but as I often do in such situations, I nodded my head and pretended to
hear all.  So when Jim's email arrived later that afternoon asking me
what times worked best for me, I had no clue what he was talking
about.  I related my schedule.  "Perfect," he responded.  "I'll get
right on it."

"Get right on it?" I thought to myself.  "Get right on what?"

Turns out everyone rightly pegged Jim as (but mistook me for) the
resident Hardt & Negri expert, and that I was now the
co-coordinator of the faculty-dominated _Empire_ reading
group.  You heard me correctly: a first year, in his second quarter,
was assumed expert enough in the Hardt & Negri corpus to lead a
faculty-dominated reading group.  (In retrospect I realize the faith
Julia placed in Jim was well-founded, and her willingness to defer to a
graduate student on the topic a sign that she practiced the
egalitarianism she preached.  But I digress.)  So I participated in
this reading group with Jim, Julia and a host of imposing faculty
members like Mark Poster and Andrzej Warminski.  One of the highlights
of my first year, I tell you.  

_Time passes._ 
 

The year is 2005.  It is Spring Quarter.  I haven't thought about _Empire_ or
been all that theoretically inclined for years.  I still own the book,
mind you, and it still overbrims with my original marginalia.  I'm
invested in every page.  Manic glossing.  Attack this point here,
cheer-lead that point there.  

The phone rings.  

"Hello?" I say, assuming the voice at the other end belongs to a
machine which desires nothing more than to clean my carpet, lower my
mortgage rates or help me refinance my loans.

"Yes, I'm told you have _Empire_," the voice says.  

"What?  I  have empire?" 

"_Empire_, _Empire_, Hardt, Negri, _Empire_."

"The book?"

"Can I borrow it?  Wait, hold on, you talk to him."

On the line now is someone who knew I helped organize the _Empire_ reading
group.  He had tried to contact Jim, but Jim had since fled Irvine for
fields criss-crossed by tracks of tenure.  So he went to the next name
anyone knew.  Mine.  

"Hi Scott.  Spivak needs a copy of a _Empire_ for her class next week and she left hers at home.  Can she borrow yours?"

"Sure.  Why not."

Later that day, my copy of _Empire_ is hand-delivered to Spivak.

_Time passes._

The quarter ends.  I check my mailbox after turning in my grades, and there is my copy of _Empire_. 
No note.  No nothing.  Just the book in the box.  I put it in my bag
and walk home.  When I take it out of my bag, something falls out of
it.  

A postcard.  [The second strangest thing I've ever found in a book](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/where\_do\_little\_books\_come\_from/#4570).  Written on it is the following:
I
need to excuse myself from auditing your class, as I will need to miss
tomorrow's class.  Which is too much to miss in a four-seek seminar. 
(I will hopefully catch up next Spring if you're back.)  I will,
however, attend your lecture the final Friday.

No
name.  Signed only "With warm thought."  I think that a strange thing
to leave in a book you knew would be returned to someone else.  I
wonder if there's anything else in the book, perhaps something more
important, something she'd like returned.  Flipping through the pages,
I notice unfamiliar handwriting.  Check marks.  Exclamation points. 
Things I hadn't written.  I start to read this new marginalia.  Next to
a note of mine on 181 which reads "empire resides in a world constantly
calls it into existence" I find a giant checkmark.  Next to the more
cryptic "Hobbes: sovereignty, transcendence, representation" on 84
appears "What?!?"  

My marginalia has been judged.  By Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.  And
been found wanting.  I flip through the book and find a running
dialogue in the margins.  She approves of some of comments; is baffled
by others; and on occasion scribbles corrections.  I realize that my
copy of _Empire_ has been glossed.  Not merely glossed, but
glossed twice over, first by myself, then by Spivak.  I wonder whether
she responds to Hardt and Negri's texts or my comments.  

I wonder what she said in the seminars.  I try to reconstruct what she said about _Empire_ in
the public lectures which I had attended and which her anonymous
correspondent said he would.  I wonder if he did.  I wonder all of this
and realize that I was supposed to finish the two-part series on
Foucault and not prattle on and on and on about the books I would use
to do so.

I still do not understand why you stop taking your meds to test to see if you are making any thyroid hormones on your own.  This never happens to me and you know I have been on thyroid meds for 30 years.  

On the other subject you may view your early work with your advanced education and notice how much you have evolved as a writer. Don't stop your blogg!!!

Is this some elaborate joke along the lines of "Can the White Male Jewish Hearing Impaired (Deaf, but Not Deaf Culture, Identifying) Graduate Student Blogger Speak?"  

By the way the non-rhetorical answer to that question would be, maybe not now, but, based on past evidence, soon yes, and a lot.
