 You were the best dog.  Someone had abused you mercilessly then left you to die.  The shelter found you wandering around I-10 in 1992.  They named you something dumb like "Interstate" or "Highway."  We adopted you and rechristened you Pokey.  At first we thought you were a racist because you attacked the black architect who was working on our house.  Later we learned that you hated men with mustaches regardless of race.  We figured some mustachioed man had beaten and abandoned you.  You wore a long leash your entire life because your favorite game was "Almost Got Me."  

The door would open and you would bolt.  We would run after you.  You would stop to make sure we were chasing you and then when we were three feet away you would dart another half mile.  You would always wait for us to catch up before you would bolt again.  You didn't want to leave us.  You only wanted to be chased.  Once you ran into a stable and scared some horses and that was awesome.  Eventually we decided to put a long leash around your neck so you could not dash so far so fast.  We knew you loved the game but we did not want you to die playing it.

You hated cats but you loved Tigger.  There you are barking at a cat outside with Tigger riding shotgun.  You did not know Tigger was a cat.  We would think you were asleep and then all of the sudden we would be hit by the slobbery Tigger you had flung at us.  We knew  you wanted us to take him from you so you could growl and wrestle with him.  We knew you loved Tigger so we decided not to tell you he was a cat.  You were an awesome dog.

When you developed canine epilepsy we discovered you loved cheese.  You would only take your phenobarbital if we wrapped it in cheese and so we did.  Then the seizures stopped and we were happy.  Mom wanted to keep you alive so I could say goodbye this Christmas but you could not stop throwing up the cheese with your phenobarbital in it and started having seizures again.  I know how selfish it sounds but I wanted to say goodbye and I wish you could have held out a little longer.  I know you wanted to see me again and were sorry you could not.  I know I wanted to see you again and am devestated I cannot.  Mom and Dad were with you at the end so I know you felt safe and comfortable when you left us.  I wish I had had a chance to say goodbye but I am glad you do not suffer anymore.

You were the best dog ever.

The Pokey-mon had an underbite like none I've ever seen. He was a superhero, and defended your parents from the neighborhood cats. He was the fifth Replacement, who was never once sorry for forgetting to take out the trash. He pee'd on all of your previous girlfriends; he was never one for irony. I will miss the Poke.

They really do become such a part of your life.

My lovely cat, Feathers, age 19, passed away last Christmas eve and I still haven't been able to bring myself to get another.

My heartfelt sympathies.

One of my friends had a Samoyed that he named Macushla, Gaelic for "my pulse."

When Macushla died, my friend grieved greatly. I sent him a letter of sorrow, telling him, "I'm sorry to hear that Macushla died. I know he was your heart."

Sorry to hear of Pokey, a dog I never knew, but he sounds like _your_ heart.

Scott, I've seen you posting around and I've visited your blog on and off, but only recently started reading regularly (not just because of the sex story, I swear, but because of the other funny posts you've written -- like your story of discovering and abusing theory).  Anyway, this is the first time I've commented and it's because you made me CRY.

That was a lovely tribute to an awesome dog.  I hope Pokey is playing the "almost got me" game in eternity.

Scott,

I'm at a loss for words right now. I had to put my dog of ten years (a stray that I found on the side of the road in Indiana) to sleep the day after my birthday this year. I don't mean to try to undermine your loss and your pain. I just want you to know that I understand how you must feel right now. I'm crying as I write this. Your memoriam to Pokey brings up too many memories for me. But I'm also crying because I can tell when a dog really means something to someone. 

Best wishes to you and your family.

My condolences. He was a great dog indeed. Sounds like you and yours gave him a happy, rich life.

Scott, I am deeply sorry for your loss.

I bought my first dog this year, and she brightens my days in a way that no human can.  Calling them man's best friend doesn't quite cut it.  They're our roommates, our children, our students, and our consolers.

May Pokey rest in peace.

I am so very sorry to hear of your loss. Losing a loved pet just plain sucks.

I'm so sorry, man. Words are useless at a time like this.

Pokey was the best "Little Man" in the entire world. It's nice that people have written comments to this. It's nice to hear that my brother has made so many of you cry! No but seriously I was ok with my dog passing until my brother sent me this link and then it was all down hill from there. But again I must say my dog was amazing and if I have anything to do with it, he will never be forgotten. He came into our lives by chance and he left us with our hearts filled and our minds stuffed with memories. He is forever loved!

Scott, I'm sorry to hear for your (and your family's) loss.  I'll never forget the day my oldest friend David called to tell me that his beloved dog Eleanor had passed away.  Perhaps the strongest person I know, he was moved to tears delivering the sad news to me.  Eleanor was a great pet and companion.  I knew I was officially welcomed to their home when Eleanor came to greet me.

Condolences.  I've never lost a parent or a sibling, but I have lost several pets over the years; everyone tells me that losing a family member is so much worse, but I can't imagine how.  I don't believe in heaven for humans -- we've done so little to deserve it -- but I believe our dearly departed dogs and cats and birds and lizards and fish and assorted rodents are all enjoying each other's company on a far, far better plane of existence than this....  And I would probably believe in God if it mean I could see them again....
