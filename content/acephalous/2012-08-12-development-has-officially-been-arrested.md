Because this weekend should consist entirely of good news, I am  pleased to announce that the University of California, Irvine, has  accepted a most exceptional student:

That is correct: George Michael Bluth is now "officially" enrolled at  UCI. I couldn't be happier. Unfortunately, it appears that George  Michael's not the only new member of the UCI community. A ghost was  spotted disembarking from a flight into John Wayne Memorial Airport:

I've never been a prouder Anteater. Happy days are here again, my friends. (Even if they are wearing socks and sandals.)
