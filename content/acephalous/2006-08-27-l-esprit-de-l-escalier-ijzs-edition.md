A little birdy asked why I hadn't taken the time to mock Jodi's [announcement](http://jdeanicite.typepad.com/i\_cite/2006/08/international\_j.html) of _[International Journal of Žižek Studies](http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/zizek/home.cfm)_' inaugural issue.  I answered with a lame parody of "[First They Came](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First\_they\_came...)."  I should've written:
I will, I will, as soon as I finish reading these articles I photocopied from _[The Jack London Journal](http://london.sonoma.edu/Essays/journal.html)_ and [_The Henry James Review_](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/henry\_james\_review/) and proofing this note I've placed in the forthcoming [_James Joyce Quarterly_](http://www.utulsa.edu/jjq/) ...

Where is the lame parody?

I wrote, riffing on those last comments:

I would, but I like the ghettoizing of Zizek.  First they came for Baudrillard, and I said nothing.  Then they came for Zizek, and I said nothing...

Mostly, I'm not the kind of kettle who can call a pot black.

That's hilarious--and, I love the contextualization in the main post (although, frankly, not being a literary type myself, on the face of things, those journals seem to make more sense.) And, although I may have missed something, I can't recall coming across The Foucauldian Review, The Jacques Derrida Quarterly, or Heidegger Today (a scary thought). Constellations has a Habermasian bent; Theory and Event leans Deleuzian. And, there is Lacan Ink.

I know there's a [_Foucault Studies_](http://www.foucault-studies.com/no3/index.html), but I've only ever read an article or two from it.  While I'm surprised there's not a _Derrida Quarterly_, that may be because (as someone mentioned in your comments) Derrida didn't need his own journal to have his ideas discussed widely; he was being published and written about in _Critical Inquiry_, _Diacritics_, &c.

I had no idea about Foucault Studies. Thanks for the heads up.

While Foucault Studies is regularly of the highest quality, it is apparently on temporary hiatus as the founding editors hand over the reigns to another group.  The editorship of Zizek Studies might consider making an inquiry into the half-death of Foucault Studies in order to avoid its fate....

Does it make sense to devote an entire journal to someone who has devoted most of his academic career to synthesis when they could simply spend better time studying the original sources?

Considering Zizek's love of Lacan, I'm guessing you're not a big fan, Scott. But tell me, why not have love for Baudrillard? (If not as a philosopher, at least one can appreciate his work as literature.)
