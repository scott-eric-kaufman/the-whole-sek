Scott Eric Kaufman, PhD died at age 39 in Houston, Texas on November 21 after a long illness.

Scott is survived by his parents, Jeffrey and Alice Kaufman; his brother Marty Kaufman and sister Sarah Miller. He is also survived by his niece and nephew Arya and Grayson Miller, his aunt, Sandra Kurlander, and cousins Mara and Matthew.

Scott was born in Plainfield, New Jersey and raised both in Randolph NJ and Baton Rouge Louisiana. After graduating with honors from Louisiana State University he attended the University of California at Irvine where he received his PhD in English.

After graduation he taught at UCI as a professor of English concentrating on media and rhetoric.  Most recently he was assistant editor at Salon.com magazine.

In his early years Scott was an avid baseball and soccer player. He was a lifelong fan of the New York Mets and New York Giants and loved following English Premier League soccer.

Scott has always had a passion for books, reading and writing. His scholarly interests once included everything—and that means everything—pertaining to American literature and appropriations of evolutionary theory c. 1890-1910. Then he finished his dissertation and decided to study film and television. He has written a book on visual rhetoric called, appropriately enough, *Seeing Rhetoric*.

In addition to the blog he founded, *Acephalous*, he wrote for *Lawyers, Guns & Money* blog where he not only ran the podcasts, he co-hosted one of his own about *Game of Thrones*. He has written at many other places including founding of the Internet Film School on *The Onion* and the *Raw Story*.

Archived posts by him concerning literary theory can be found at *The Valve*, where he served as an editor for a long time. He also wrote about historicism and literary history for what is now *The Chronicle of Higher Education*'s history blog, *The Edge of the American West*.

His work is followed on line by thousands of readers.
