roy edroso is clearly an intelligent man, but in [this case](http://alicublog.blogspot.com/2009/05/2009\_05\_03\_archive.html#7199490276777447155) he couldn’t be more wrong.  He quotes one of the [geniuses from _Big Hollywood_](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/stkarnick/2009/05/09/zombie-culture-and-the-march-of-socialism/#more-130078) (who, incidentally, just learned what the word “satrap” meant):

In their neverending quest to wrest more power by creating what H. L. Mencken correctly characterized as an endless series of hobgoblins requiring a socialist elite’s powers to destroy, the socialists and their media satraps continually raise fears of everything conceivable . . .

Then argues that:

Naturally he doesn’t link; this is from Mencken’s _In Defense of Women_, and the [passage](http://books.google.com/books?id=mNQt2WQl-VgC&pg=PA51&dq=%!m(MISSING)encken%!+(MISSING)%!e(MISSING)ndless+series+of+hobgoblins%!)(MISSING) from which it comes doesn’t mention socialists at all, and is explicitly about the starting and conduct of modern wars, which Mencken attributes to modern civilization “especially under democracy.” But I don’t think Karnick was purposely misleading his readers . . .

Because Mr. Word-of-the-Day wasn’t misleading his readers.  roy doesn’t seem to realize that conservatives only discovered Seth Graeme-Smith’s _Pride and Prejudice and Zombies_ [earlier this week](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGI1OTc5ZTA2NTBmMTMyMGFhMmRkYzdkN2U2MzZhZjk=) and that this _Big Hollywood-_style satrap is merely playing along.  Just like Graeme-Smith improved upon Austen by inserting zombies into scenes in which they clearly don’t belong, conservatives are now inserting socialists and communists into diatribes in which they clearly don’t belong.

For example, Donald Douglas complains that people find the idea of him being a professor beyond belief, but then [he writes this](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/youre-professor-really.html):

I saved a classic example of the “I can’t believe you’re a professor” slur from a post last year,” [Matt Yglesias, Jennifer Palmieri, and the Third Way](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/matt-yglesias-jennifer-palmieri-and.html).” As some readers know, Matthew Yglesias is [an American communist](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/03/why\_not\_arbitrary\_limits\_on\_executive\_pay.php). There is no position that’s too far to the left for that man.

Clearly, anyone who thinks that there “is no position too far to the left for [Yglesias]” deserves to have his credentials questioned.  Off the top of my head, I can list _fifteen comments on every one of Yglesias’s posts going back seven years_ as evidence that lefter positions than those he’s staked exist.  Douglas duct-taped the evidentiary bar to his ankles, so he shouldn’t be surprised that people are incredulous when he claims that his day job involves teaching impressionable youths how to hurdle.

But it’s all a ruse.

Douglas is merely playing the zombifying game with socialists and communists.

He doesn’t believe Yglesias is a communist anymore than Graeme-Smith thinks Austen really wrote about zombies.  He’s not hilariously obtuse—he’s just playing the communitizing game.  It’s like zombies, only with communists and socialists.  I’m surprised (and frankly disappointed) roy didn’t pick up on this.  Does he seriously believe conservatives have been so traumatized by three months of a painfully centrist presidency that they’re spying pinkos in the hedgerows?

_A__s if._

Roy Edroso is an incredibly funny and talented writer.  And yet I don’t read his blog all that often because I have a limited appetite for making fun of wingnuts.

I go back and forth on whether _Sadly, NO!_ is funny, but they do read and report on stuff that I don’t have the stomach to read myself. The attempts at humor, successful or not, take a little bit of the edge off.

Somewhere or another is a post I wrote (and you commented on) where I detailed my problems with the _Sadly, No!_ approach to political humor, but now I can’t find it.  

More generally, I’m a little surprised at how people react to my dipping into the conservative pool.  They’re never pure mockery of the sort _Sadly, No!_ doles out.  I’m usually interested in a very particular point, like [the notion that Prince Philip is a paragon of dignity](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/he-has-a-habit-of-saying-things-like-youre-all-a-bunch-of-bastards/) or [their seeming inability to draw parallels from cultural artifacts](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/evacuate-in-out-moment-of-triumph-i-think-you-overestimate-their-chances/) or, in this case, the fact that they’re doing with socialists/communists what Graeme-Smith did with zombies . . . only unintentionally.

You mean [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/some-people-ear/comments/page/2/#comments) discussion? I wasn’t reading _Sadly, No!_ at that point, so I didn’t actually participate in that bit of the discussion. I dropped in later to raise questions about evidentiary standards, but didn’t really make much of an impression.

They’re not my only source who keeps an eye in that direction. Aside from you — and I’ve gotten some good out of your posts; I admire, and don’t entirely understand, why you do it at the level you do — I also read Dave Niewert, Digby, Andrew Sullivan (though I’m losing patience) and I still drop in on Daniel Larison from time to time.

[This comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/some-people-ear.html?cid=93598754#comment-93598754) is what I was thinking of.

_I’ve gotten some good out of your posts; I admire, and don’t entirely understand, why you do it at the level you do_

Different days, different reasons, but at the core I’m interested in how cultural and political issues collide in the act of interpretation — which is why the _protein wisdom_/_Patterico_ feud interested me, or why John Ziegler can’t seem to understand his own rhetorical position, &c.  That’s why _Big Hollywood_ fascinates me: it’s an operation founded upon misprision after misprision, which the comments further validate.  If one part of the reason this interests me is because I feel my discipline was/is complicit in the blurring the lines between between good/bad/wildly improbable readings of cultural artifacts, the other part would be because unlike a lot of my brethren, I’m less interested in producing “interesting” readings myself than I am in coming to understand how “interesting” readings become cultural norms.  (Hence, the dissertation.)

That’s the comment I was pointing too, as well, but I’d gotten there by another route which didn’t link cleanly. 

_I feel my discipline was/is complicit in the blurring the lines between between good/bad/wildly improbable readings of cultural artifacts,_

On one level, I entirely agree; on the other, I’m not convinced. I don’t think literature bears the responsibility for post-structuralism in isolation (though your colleagues certainly ran farther and faster with it than most), nor does it bear responsibility at all for the fundamentalist ideological reaction to modernity at the heart of cultural conservativism.

“fundamentalist ideological reaction to modernity” seems a bit facile.  I don’t understand the “Big Hollywood” blog, but they’re clearly strongly attracted to the contemporary entertainment industry, and even their resentments of it presuppose “modernity” in most senses of the term.  

Here’s a question, Scott: can we trace some version of this attraction-resentment stance toward commercial popular culture back into the 19th century USA?

**[Ahistoricality](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com)**

					

		

_“fundamentalist ideological reaction to modernity” seems a bit facile._

It is. It’s a comment, not a dissertation.

But not for the reasons you’re citing: just because someone is reacting badly to modernity doesn’t mean that they necessarily have to disengage or reject it _in toto_. Someone who is retreating from relativism with manichean literalism might still want to be entertained, might enjoy the technological fruits of progress and commerce while disdaining the liberal diversity and state expansion which accompanied them.

**Colin**

					

		

A, you’re theorizing about a “someone” whom you’ve summoned up in your imagination.  I don’t doubt your ability to imagine all kinds of world views, but that does not necessarily help us understand real people in the real world.  I also think your category of “modernity” is being made to explain way too much, but that’s another conversation.  

Scott’s project is interesting because it’s an effort to work out what actual people are saying and doing.  I’d be happy to discuss the writings of other actual contemporary cultural conservatives, and then we can see if your proposed framework sheds light on them.  But failing that, the “heart of cultural conservatism” bit above is vacuous.

No, I’m summarizing my impressions of many someones, past and present. 

The category gambit is a nice move, but I don’t know you well enough to care whether you approve of my ideas.

_just because someone is reacting badly to modernity doesn’t mean that they necessarily have to disengage or reject it in toto_

True.  Zombies clearly reacted badly to modernity at first, but they went out and hired some media satraps, and now are meshing with modernity quite nicely.  Just to give one example.  (Don’t ask me for another one.  I’m polishing a filmscript about Amish Zombies and can’t be bothered.)

First Round:  

Pride v. Prejudice  

Zombies v. Yglesias  

Socialists v. Communists

Prejudice goes on to the semis after defeating Pride in a close match 5-4; despite his superior ability to manipulate qualia, Yglesias is eventually overwhelmed by the Zombies 4-2; Socialists are steamrollered by the Communists 3-0 and get a bye through to the finals.

_can we trace some version of this attraction-resentment stance toward commercial popular culture back into the 19th century USA?_ 

Absolutely.  In the ideal version of my dissertation-to-book, I balance the ways in which evolutionary theory was popularly debated in the 1890s (at the birth of what would become the Modern Synthesis) with how it’s popularly debated today.  So, yes, a chapter on PZ Myers vs. the intelligent designers vs. the creationists, but telescoped out so as not to simply rehash the nonsense.  What the recent intelligent design debates have that was absent for the past eighty years was an ostensibly viable opponent to Darwinian evolution.  Note, I don’t think intelligent design’s viable, but unlike pure creationism, it works with the actual body of scientific data in a way that mimics (some would say “mocks”) the way responsible scientists work . . . which is very much like what went on before neo-Darwinism slew the mighty Lamarck.  

_Scott’s project is interesting because it’s an effort to work out what actual people are saying and doing._

This is basically the trick behind my dissertation: instead of taking Hofstadter at his word (_Social Darwinism in American Thought_), I went back and re-read the source material and _wouldn’t you know_? Hofstadter’s claim didn’t jibe with reality.  I like to think that my interest in conservative punditry (such that it is) stems from a similar instinct not to dismiss theoretical idiocy when we live in an era in which there’s a superabundance of actual evidence of said idiocy.

_But did you really have to respond with two tags blaming her?_

Didn’t notice I did that.  Will correct.

Thanks for this.  I remember coming across mid-20th-century attacks on General Relativity that followed a similar pattern.  Freud also used to be much more of a cultural lightning rod than he is now.  I wonder why.

I have an aligned interest, I think, in sorting out smart and useful and genuinely critical conservative thinking from the mere ressentiment that underlies a lot of what you bring to our attention.

Hmm. A movement in the mid 20th century that promoted attacks on the theories of Einstein and Freud? I wonder what the roots of that could have been? Might it have been based on some common attribute of the two men?

Well, I, for one, am terrified! Karnick is right on the money… except that he’s facing the wrong way. The Zombies are an historical artifact- Where?- why, Haiti… THAT’S where! And where did AIDS come from? And WHEN? And then, Americans were ‘bitten’… and an insidious thing happened: our Capitalism turned BAD… and went to China; and it BIT them; and then the Idealism of Mao was crushed, in the stampede to become… Capitalist Zombies, like US! (and it was OK at First, because they made stuff for Us… but then they wanted More than the everyday things that they were making to ship to Walmart & Costco, & Harbor Freight. They wanted Cars, and AC current, and… and now they want their VERY OWN CAR INDUSTRY. And soon we’ll need another planet to provide for the lifestyle of Zombie Capitalism gone amok!.. and those prophetic words, …”and so on and so on for decade after decade..” will have come to fruition… god help us! (Hey, Zeus! we need you, too!)   ^..^

We don’t need Zeus for Zombie Capitalism, herbert.  We don’t need Zeus for anything.

As Adam Smith wrote in his posthumously published [History of Astronomy](http://www.aier.org/aier/publications/ejw\_wat\_may09\_kennedy.pdf)

Fire burns, and water refreshes; heavy bodies descend, and lighter substances fly upwards, by the necessity of their own nature; nor was the invisible hand of Jupiter ever apprehended to be employed in those matters.

The bad news: the invisible gravitational hand of Jupiter is unlikely to swing another habitable planet into a conveniently close orbit, at least not without the risks associated with heavy bodies descending.

Hmmm… good points, Michael. Perhaps we can facilitate a transfer of capitalist Zombies to Venus- a place of mystery, & hot swirling gases- which (I believe) was Jupiter’s most recent gift to our section of the solar system. (& thanx for the Adam Smith quote!)  ^..^

jacobo timerman’s captors told him:

“Argentina has three main enemies: Karl Marx, because he tried to destroy the Christian concept of society; Sigmund Freud, because he tried to destroy the Christian concept of the family; and Albert Einstein, because he tried to destroy the Christian concept of time and space.”
