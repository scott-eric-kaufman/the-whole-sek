## Were I a “Real American,” I would’ve ended this post “It doesn’t help matters any that they all look alike.”

Via [_PostBourgie_](http://postbourgie.com/2009/04/09/of-easy-names-and-idiocy/), I learn that Texas State Representative Betty Brown thinks Asian-Americans should [adopt names](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6365320.html) “easier for Americans to deal with.”  When called out on this, a spokesperson compounded Rep. Brown’s idiocy by saying “her comments were only an attempt to overcome problems with identifying Asian names for voting purposes.”

Problem the first: if people vote in American elections, _they’re Americans_, so the notion that they ought to adopt names “easier for Americans to deal with” entails a definition of “American” that excludes “American citizens.”  These citizens are Americans who “deal with” their names dandily, so Rep. Brown’s statement makes no sense on its face—unless you assume that she _means_ to exclude certain American citizens from her definition of “American.”  Had she been a little clearer, this confusion could’ve been avoided.  All she needed to say is that Asian-Americans should adopt names “easier for _Real Americans_ to deal with” and no one would’ve batted an eye at the remarks by the racist old white woman from Texas.

Problem the second: I teach at a school where [more than half of the students](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/where-i-am-i-dont-know-ill-never-know-in-the-silence-you-dont-know-you-must-go-on-i-cant-go-on/) are of East or Southeast Asian descent, and let me tell you: I have never had a class that wasn’t stuffed full of Jennifers and Jessicas.  Why?

I’m not as qualified to speak to this as I would’ve been had LSU not dismantled the linguistics program my senior year (_not that I’m bitter_), but as I remember it, about half of the Chinese consonants fall somewhere between what native English speakers would hear as a “j,” so to native Chinese speakers “Jessica” and “Jennifer” sound more like actual names.  I could expand this out to the voiceless affricative equivalent of “j,” the English “ch” sound, but suffice to say that if you think about all the different ways you can pronounce “Beijing,” you’ll see my point.  So it only makes sense that the most common Chinese-American names have initial consonant sounds that resemble Chinese phonemes.  (I could expand it even further and talk about more than Chinese, but the same principle applies.)

All of which is only to say that if the Asian-American community wants to make it easier for “Real Americans to deal with” them, they don’t need to simplify their names so much as make them more complex.  One quarter I had three students in a class of twenty-three named “Jennifer Hu” and two named “Jessica Quan.”  Not that I count as a “Real American,” mind you, but if I did I wouldn’t be advocating for _less_ variety in Asian-American names but _much more_.

I don’t think you’re right (more than anecdotally) about the prevalence of J in Western-names-for-Chinese-in-America — the rule doesn’t hold for my work colleagues, for example.  So there’s no need to harass you about your account of Mandarin phonetics.

I wonder if my name, Vance Maverick, is American, or Texan, enough for Rep. Brown. If so, why am I forever having to spell it out?

My sense is that the “J” name hypothesis isn’t true.  If I had to describe the phenomenon, it would be that the Western names adopted tend to be a little old fashioned and very solid (Grace, Harold, Andrew, not Jaden, Ashley, Chandler.)  

“Real American” is like “real whipped cream.”

What makes Ms. Rep. Brown’s comment even more ludicrous (if that’s possible) is that the gentleman to whom she was addressing her comments was named “Ramey Ko” – whose surname, at least, doesn’t really leave a _lot_ of room for mispronunciation. Maybe it was the “Ramey” part that was the problem…

There seems to be a bit of generational divide. Pretty much all of my relatives who immigrated from Taiwan in the 1960s and 1970s took fairly simple American English names, as did lots of others who immigrated around the same time. But many more recent immigrants are not adopting similar names. 

Meanwhile, my Chinese middle name appears to be, as far as search engines are concerned, unique to me.

You know, I remembered reading this somewhere else — a journal or somesuch — but couldn’t relocate it yesterday, so I’m not wedded to what I may be misremembering.  It makes intuitive sense to me, though, that when selecting a name in a new language you would gravitate to names that contain phonemes from your native tongue.  I mean, if I emigrated somewhere I didn’t speak the language, the odds of me adopting a name I couldn’t pronounce would be slim.  But the one point you make that I only gestured at is that the number of different pronunciation schemes collected under the word “Chinese” makes generalizations difficult to make.  (Much less “Asian.”)

_If I had to describe the phenomenon, it would be that the Western names adopted tend to be a little old fashioned and very solid (Grace, Harold, Andrew, not Jaden, Ashley, Chandler.)_

You know, I could make this less anecdotal: I have eight years of course rosters myself, and another six from my wife, so I could muster up a decently sized sample set.  (Hey, if they can generalize about students based on my students, I can too!)

_Meanwhile, my Chinese middle name appears to be, as far as search engines are concerned, unique to me._

In the Chinese or pinyin?  Because I’ve seen a lot of odd transliterations of common words/names when they made in pinyin.

In the way it’s spelled on my official records, which is whatever my parents decided on when I was born. I think that means it’s a Wade-Giles-based transliteration. I’ve forgotten the characters; I never thought of searching for them, but now I’m going to do that sometime.

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

About the phonetics, it’s true that among the initial consonants of Mandarin, there’s not only our sh/j/ch but also the equivalent at a different point of articulation. So in that sense it’s got a lot of J.

**Chris**

					

		

It’s easy to mock a Southerner who can’t spell names like Lee, but perhaps we should remember that Asia is a big place; “Srinivasa Ramanujan” and “Toyotomi Hideyoshi” are also (historical) Asian names, and names somewhat similar to them could be used by people of Asian descent even today.  I’m pretty sure I got them right, but it’s true that they’re not easy to get right.

None of which excuses the arrogant laziness of asking someone else to change their name so that you don’t have to learn how to spell it, of course.

Were I a “Real American,” I would’ve ended this post “It doesn’t help matters any that they all look alike.”

Here’s a little anecdote regarding your title. My dad was once on a tribunal during the Korean War investigating complaints from Korean prisoners that they were mistreated by American guards. When asked to identify the offending guards, at least several prisoners said they couldn’t do that. Why not? “Because all Americans look alike.”

I wonder how Ms. Rep. Brown would survive with M. Filanoski, S Filanosky, E. Geisendaffer, P. Gokulakrishna, N. Jaimabgal, M. Kudlagunti, A. Moralesguadalupe, C. Okonkwo, M. Papavasilopoulos, G. Vavaroutsos, FA. Yamjnjneajad, and A. Zilokowlski as constituents of hers.  These are a select few of the American names found in Baltimore, Maryland.  

We are one of the melting pots of America.  At least a dozen languages are spoken here.  Most of the first generation citizens speak a credible English.  All of the second generation citizens speak English as a first language.  

Most, if not all of us are proud to be a part of this vastly diverse culture.

Once upon a time, I had to stencil my last surname on all my uniforms; not so bad, given what great-grand-dad picked when he got off the boat.

 I really felt sorry for the guys with eastern or southern european surnames; the guys with Chinese or Korean surnames actually had it the easiest – “Cho” or “Park” or “Lee” takes a lot less time than “Jablonski” or “Belisario” or “Constantino”…

Will back up Scott here on the ‘Jennifer/Jessica’ trend in Asian Anglo names. The other one I’ve noticed has been -son names for the males. At my HS (Sydney, Australia) there was a Johnson (he told me it was pretty much a phonetic match for his birth name) an Addison and at university Welllington and Harrison. Otherwise in girl names there was a tendency towards two-syllable names with vaguely similar phonetics ‘Lucy’, ‘Wendy’, ‘Cindy’.

_really felt sorry for the guys with eastern or southern european surnames_

Where I grew up there were plenty of people with Polish last names, and it was becoming somewhat common for the parents (second or third generation Americans) to use the traditional spelling, but to Anglicize their kids’ last name.  (e.g., “Pokrywka” becoming “Pokrifka”)

_When asked to identify the offending guards, at least several prisoners said they couldn’t do that. Why not? “Because all Americans look alike.”_

Another anecdote: My college friend and roommate’s Korean mother regularly mistook me for one of our other roommates. I’m short, with olive skin and very dark brown hair. The other roommate was six inches taller than me, pale with freckles, with bright red hair. 

As for Brown, maybe she would have preferred all the Polish and Ukrainian names I grew up around. Many of those kids could get three syllables in before they hit the first vowel.

When I went through, hypenated names were pretty rare, but I imagine they are fairly common now – pity the poor kid (male or female) who has to fit “Sorenson-Hernandez” or something similar on to a name tag…

 Like I said, I’m glad Olaf Olafsson or whatever he was picked what he picked…it has made life much easier for several generations.

I should actually tell the joke:

So this Jewish family moves to a new town and needs to find a new synagogue.  Next _Shabbos_, the father walks up to the Rabbi before service and, with a thick Yiddish accent, “Good afternoon, Reb,” and introduces himself.  “You cannot be Jewish with a name like that?  _Vi kumt a yid tsu_ to that name?”  

“You see, first time I come on the boat, I wait in long line.  They ask me who I am and I tell them ‘Moishe Blaustein,’ then they tell me, ‘We are sorry, Moishe Blaustein, but you cannot come in America because you have bad eyes.’  So they send me again to old country.  I wait and try again, and again I am in long line when I remember, ‘Moishe Blaustein’ has bad eyes and cannot come in America!  My head it pounds, my hearts it races, and I sweat like mule.  ‘You must not be Moishe Blaustein,’ I think.  ‘You must be someone else, someone nobody would think is Moishe Blaustein.  You must be . . .’  And I think very hard as line moves and I come up with ‘Shohlem Moykher Abramovitsch.’  As the line moves, my head hurts more, my heart pounds more, but I repeat, ‘Your name is “Shohlem Moykher Abramovitsch.”  Your name is “Shohlem Moykher Abramovitsch.”  Your name is “Shohlem Moykher Abramovitsch.”‘  Finally I get to front of line, and when they ask for name, I say ‘Moi—‘ but I stop.  My head throbs, I cannot take it, they ask again, ‘What is your name?’  ‘What is my name?’ I say, ‘What is my name?  I will tell you my name.  My name is—‘ but nothing comes!  Mendele Yitzhak Rabinovitch?  Avram Lipke Goldfaden?  Who am I?  Then they say, ‘If you do not tell me your name, we will have to send you back.’  ‘_Oy vey, kh’hob shoyn fargesn!_‘ I yell, and they say, ‘Welcome to America, Sean Fergusson.'”

Because “_kh’hob shoyn fargesn_” means “I’ve forgotten” in Yiddish.

It’s not polite to speak ill of the dead—even when they’re only ventriloquized.  I tried to imagine how my grandfather would’ve told it (because I know he told me the story, but I don’t remember how), so that’s the best approximation I could do.

Anyway, I’d like to see you do better!
