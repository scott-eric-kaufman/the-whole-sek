**Jen:** CALIFORNIA’S BURNING!

**Pat:** That’s really interesting, Jen, because you know what else is burning?  Felicia Smith of Santa Ana’s love for the kind of quality programming you can only find here on NPR.  She says it’s a constant companion, whether she’s on the way to work, running errands, or having unimpassioned sex with her fiancé of eleven years.

**Bob:** Speaking of impending nuptials, Pat, people really value their relationship to NPR.  Kat Little from Costa Mesa even compares the difference between being a listener and an active supporter to the hours between when a couple exchanges their vows and the moment the marriage is consummated.  “You’ve already made the commitment,” she says, “but only 100 percent of the way.  You need to go 110 percent and hit that already.”

**Pat:** Funny you should mention math, Bob, because here at NPR listeners will find exclusive maths they can’t find anywhere else.  Consider when you’re on the highway with your secretary, on the way to your favorite bed and breakfast, and you think about the first time you hit that and you wonder whether your infidelity is a personal failing or the product of millions of years of evolution, so you turn on NPR because where else can you get [the Loh Down on Science](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast\_detail.php?siteId=7060613)? and you learn not even swans or fruit flies mate for life and start thinking about the sweet inevitable love you’re about to make with your secretary.

**Bob:** And maybe when you’re done you can buy her the gift of an NPR supporter package where she’ll receive not one but _two_ copies of the book _Green Living through Healthy Oil and Taxes_.  It makes a great stocking stuffer for anyone who already listens to NPR as much as you do and received their copy when their membership was automatically renewed for the seventeenth year running.  Being a contributor is just simply that convenient.

**Pat:** While we’re on the subject of convenience, Bob, if our listener and his secretary’s favorite bed and breakfast is anywhere north of Orange County, they’ll likely find their route up there to be really tortured by the lines of fires currently engulfing all of Los Angeles County and much of the rest of the Southland.  For more on this important story, the kind of story and reporting you can only find on NPR, we turn to Jen on the scene.

**Jen:** CALIFORNIA’S BURNING!  CHRIST YOU FUCKER EVERYTHING’S ON FUCKING FIRE!

**Bob:** That’s really interesting, Jen, because you know what else is on fire?  Copies of _Green Living through Healthy Oil and Taxes_ which the _LA Times_ calls the must-read book this holiday season . . .

I had no idea NPR had a “morning zoo” show.

Also, is this the SNL blog?

No, not SNL.  Those are the actual names of my NPR people: Pat Morrison and Bob, er, Something-or-Other.

So, so true, and so, so perfect.  But only those in the KPCC listening area get this, I think.

Ha.  Our pledge drive ended a month ago.

I succumbed last spring to the $10/month credit card charge.  That way I can ignore the demands in good faith.

SEK has his own NPR people?  I will never buy his claims of modesty again.

Thank god pledge drive is over up hear in the part of CA that gets rain.

They are too highly leveraged, anyway.

A la Schwetty Balls, I think. Make that secretary an “intern” and you can reach the cougar market too. (How old before you can be a cougar?)

This has nothing to do with this post, but I just had a thought and what’s the point of having a thought if you don’t broadcast it on the internet?

I wonder if there’s any linkage between Obama’s meeting with McCain and his absolution of Lieberman.  Do you suppose the president-elect is trying to cobble together a 60-vote senate bloc, and McCain and Lieberman, those famous friends, came as a package?

Just a thought.

It’s not hard to imagine that McCain would be angry at the Republican leadership, which did him no favors during the bailout negotiations (not that he did himself any favors).  Anyway, I like it.  That’s bi-partisanship I can believe in!

Certainly better than imagining that Lieberman suckered the caucus one more time.

McCain campaigned too closely to the normal Republican line: unless he wants to claim that he was, in a word, lying the whole campaign, abandoning the Republican caucus at this point would seem personal and petty.

McCain wouldn’t have to leave the Republican caucus in order help block an obstructionist filibuster on most issues and he’d only need one or two “moderate” Republicans to play along in order for it not to seem like his bad faith alone.  Afterall, in his mavericky years in the Senate, he didn’t win Miss Congeniality.  He won the Senate’s Mr. Tight Buns competition, 1984-2002.

I don’t think urbino was saying that McCain would abandon the party, was he?  He was just saying that he might vote with the Dems to ensure cloture.

It’s not entirely clear to me why, after reading JPool’s comment, I rewrote it.

Sucker.  They only got $8.33/month out of me, and for that I get a charming tote bag.

I don’t know why anyone would expect McCain or Lieberman to keep up their part of a deal, if such a deal was actually made at all.
