Before I could return _[The Damnation of Theron Ware](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605896969/diesekoschmar-20)_ to [my beloved](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html) [library](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unbelievable-up.html), I had to remove all the notes I’d stuck to its pages. It took me a while:

[![Note\_wheel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-pi)

The resulting note wheel is as lovely as it is meaningless, because I remember absolutely nothing about _The Damnation of Theron Ware._ From my notes, I can _almost_ reconstruct why I read it:

Theron enjoys the “primitive” pleasures of Catholic picnics; contrast to earlier (235-6) image of it as orderly machine; no, from sociological & intellectual perspective it’s orderly, from internal is 
primitive

If only I knew the antecedent of “it” I might be able to reconstruct my reason for reading the book. Am I the only one for whom [the Five Year Rule](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a\_very\_unfunny\_.html) applies? (And do I _really_ want that question answered?)

Notation borrowed from a letter Joyce wrote to his mother after arriving in Paris: “Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two).” How’s that for passive-aggression?

That sort of notation is pretty common, actually, especially in formal documents.

Shoot, I can’t remember what I read five weeks ago.

_Am I the only one for whom the Five Year Rule applies?_

Not at all! I’ve even had the experience of reading papers I published a few years ago and thinking “wow, I never knew _that_!”

Pierre Bayard covers this in _How to Talk About Books You Haven’t Read_, which I used as the first text in my sophomore historiography seminar this semester. It’s only been a couple of months, therefore, but I still don’t remember very well what he says. Fortunately the table of contents offers this help:

“IV. Books You Have Forgotten (in which, along with Montaigne, we raise the question of whether a book you have read and completely forgotten, and which you have even forgotten you have read, is still a book you have read).”

Flipping to the final page of that chapter, I see that Bayard concludes thus: “To conceive of reading as a loss–whether it occurs after we skim a book, in absorbing a book by hearsay, or through the gradual process of forgetting–rather than as gain is a psychological resource essential to anyone seeking effective strategies for surviving awkward literary confrontations.”

According to his classification scheme, you may now consider this a Book You Have Heard Of, about which your opinion may be ++, +, – or –.

Flipping to the front of the chapter I see even better quotes for mastication, digestion and elimination:

“As we have now seen, there is not much between a book that has been ‘read’–if that category still has a meaning–and one that has been skimmed. But Valery has even better grounds than this for merely flipping through the works he discusses, and Baskerville, likewise, for commenting on books without opening them, which is that the most serious and thorough reading quickly metamorphoses after the fact into summary…. Reading is not just acquainting ourselves with a text or acquiring knowledge; it is also, from its first moments, an inevitable process of forgetting.”

Yep, this one’s definitely a FB (forgotten book) ++.

_That sort of notation is pretty common, actually, especially in formal documents._

Which is why it’s out of place, say, in a letter to someone’s mother.

_Shoot, I can’t remember what I read five weeks ago._

This, I can do.  What I wrote five weeks ago, however . . . 

_I’ve even had the experience of reading papers I published a few years ago and thinking “wow, I never knew that!”_

I see your “I never knew that!” and raise a “I never even knew I knew that!”  (Editing the dissertation for eventual publication is a harrowing experience.)

Unless it’s there for humorous effect. I was actually reacting to your statement that the notation was borrowed from Joyce. How so, given its commonness? That’s all.

Yes, but it’s illegible.  As my second grade teacher noted on my penmanship exams: “Scott writes like the Constitution.  Very pretty but cannot be read.”

_I was actually reacting to your statement that the notation was borrowed from Joyce. How so, given its commonness?_

I wasn’t aware of its commonness, which is why it seemed so passive aggressive to me.  (It still does, being common, just now for different reasons.)

This probably applies less to you academics than to us mere mortals, but nonetheless, here it is … Forgetfulness.

The name of the author is the first to go  

followed obediently by the title, the plot,  

the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel  

which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of

as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor  

decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,  

to a little fishing village where there are no phones.

Long ago you kissed the names of the nine Muses good-bye  

and watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,  

and even now as you memorize the order of the planets,  

something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,  

the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.

Whatever it is you are struggling to remember  

it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,  

not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.  

It has floated away down a dark mythological river  

whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall,  

well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those  

who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.

No wonder you rise in the middle of the night  

to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.  

No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted  

out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.

— Billy Collins

chingona, that’s awesome. I’m waiting for the pin drive that plugs in behind my ear, until then mortality beckons like the moon in a love poem I may once have known by heart but probably didn’t, if I read it in the first place which seems possible but unlikely.

Carl, I somehow missed your earlier comments, to which I can say: yes, while that’s generally true, the one reservation I have is that I am, by training, a close reader; so I should, in theory, be able to remember those books I didn’t skim or merely read, but which I actively and deliberately attempted to understand its guts.  My failure’s more total here, because I apparently did do that, then promptly forgot it all.  Although I can still tell you which letters Jack London wrote Cloudseley Johns in 1898 and 1899, which means I’m not completely useless.

(Yet.)

To grasp this discussion by the most boring corner, wouldn’t the merely conventional thing have been for Joyce to write “forty-two (42) hours”?  Instead he wrote “number-as-digits units (number-as-words)”, which I read as a little improvisation: first the fact, then the idea to underscore it, then the little fillip of borrowing the bureaucratic or business way to repeat numbers.

I don’t make notes, but my memory is quite bad enough to make this plausible.  (There’s an anecdote of Schubert [failing to recognize his own compositions](http://books.google.com/books?id=jM88AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA4&vq=%!r(MISSING)ecognize+his+own+work%!&(MISSING)source=gbs\_search\_r&cad=1\_1). His excuse wasn’t age — maybe terminal syphilis.)

SEK, this failure would worry me a lot more about you if I thought the skills of close reading and the skills of memory storage and retrieval were the same or even related. I see no reason to think that they are, and depending on how they’re accomplished and how mental processing is distributed, they may even be mutually defeating – as I sometimes thought as a kid when I was slogging through memorization exercises in Italian public school.

This is my favorite passage from that novel:

_the lager-drinking Irishman in a few generations will be a new type of humanity–the Kelt at his best. He will dominate America. He will be THE American._ 

Side note:  After _Main Street_was published, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote to Sinclair Lewis and said that it had replaced _Damnation_ as his favorite American novel.

That’s about all I remember.
