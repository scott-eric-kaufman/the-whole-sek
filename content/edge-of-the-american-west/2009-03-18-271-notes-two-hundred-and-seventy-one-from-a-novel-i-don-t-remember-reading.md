## 271 notes (two hundred and seventy-one) from a novel I don’t remember reading.*

Before I could return _[The Damnation of Theron Ware](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605896969/diesekoschmar-20)_ to [my beloved](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html) [library](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unbelievable-up.html), I had to remove all the notes I’d stuck to its pages. It took me a while:

[![Note\_wheel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-pi)

The resulting note wheel is as lovely as it is meaningless, because I remember absolutely nothing about _The Damnation of Theron Ware._ From my notes, I can _almost_ reconstruct why I read it:

Theron enjoys the “primitive” pleasures of Catholic picnics; contrast to earlier (235-6) image of it as orderly machine; no, from sociological & intellectual perspective it’s orderly, from internal is 
primitive

If only I knew the antecedent of “it” I might be able to reconstruct my reason for reading the book. Am I the only one for whom [the Five Year Rule](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a\_very\_unfunny\_.html) applies? (And do I _really_ want that question answered?)

Notation borrowed from a letter Joyce wrote to his mother after arriving in Paris: “Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two).” How’s that for passive-aggression?
