Because a _real_ American would’ve planted his platform right smack in front of the Liberty Bell, yes he would.

This isn’t to say I’m _still_ waiting for the folks who attack Obama for his connection to Ayers to _acknowledge_ that the man who financed the Annenberg Challenge—a.k.a. _Annenberg_—was [a close, personal friend of Ronald Reagan](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/).  Because they won’t, you know.

Wouldn’t suit “the narrative.”

The fact that it’s Annenberg who gave Ayers the $50M these folks claim is proof of Obama’s ideological kinship with the Weather Underground is irrelevant, because, well, _because_.  Reagan was a _patriot_.  Played “Born in the U.S.A.” at every—I mean, it’s not like that guitar-totin’ fellow in the picture knows jack about Philadelphia—


—Obama is a terrorist, alright?  Just vote for McCain already and I’ll shut up.  Ain’t that motivation enough?

**UPDATE:** In retrospect, maybe he should’ve gone with “Columbia” instead of “America”:
