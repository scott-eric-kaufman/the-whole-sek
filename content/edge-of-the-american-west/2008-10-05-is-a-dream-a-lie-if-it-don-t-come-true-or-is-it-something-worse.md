## Is a dream a lie if it don’t come true, or is it something worse?

Obama’s “[palling around with terrorists](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13371),” yes he is:

[![Obama Springsteen](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/springsteen.jpg?w=490 "Obama Springsteen")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/springsteen.jpg)

Because a _real_ American would’ve planted his platform right smack in front of the Liberty Bell, yes he would.

This isn’t to say I’m _still_ waiting for the folks who attack Obama for his connection to Ayers to _acknowledge_ that the man who financed the Annenberg Challenge—a.k.a. _Annenberg_—was [a close, personal friend of Ronald Reagan](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/).  Because they won’t, you know.

Wouldn’t suit “the narrative.”

The fact that it’s Annenberg who gave Ayers the $50M these folks claim is proof of Obama’s ideological kinship with the Weather Underground is irrelevant, because, well, _because_.  Reagan was a _patriot_.  Played “Born in the U.S.A.” at every—I mean, it’s not like that guitar-totin’ fellow in the picture knows jack about Philadelphia—


—Obama is a terrorist, alright?  Just vote for McCain already and I’ll shut up.  Ain’t that motivation enough?

**UPDATE:** In retrospect, maybe he should’ve gone with “Columbia” instead of “America”:

Nonononono, you don’t understand.  \*Annenberg\* didn’t give Ayers the $50M, his \*foundation\* did, and the foundation was clearly taken over by leftists.

(I’ll dig out an actual link to someone making this argument if I really have to.)

THAT STILL COUNTS!  (When dealing with that sort of logic, of course.  The fact that Annenberg was alive and personally overseeing all grants at that time IS TO BE IGNORED BECAUSE IT IS INCONVENIENT.)

But Annenberg was a Jew.  (And not the good Israeli kind.)

America September 2008

It’s always ahead, but you know what I’ve heard:  

What happens to a dream deferred?  

A dream that’s a lie is an endless return  

And each of us whispering yearn, baby, yearn

Technically, having written a song nominally (literally nominally!) about the city does not mean that Springsteen knows jack about Philadelphia.

Well, duh.  Especially when you think that it wasn’t about _real_ Philadelphians, but only the gay ones.

What’s all this yammering any way? Okay. The guy can/can’t sing. You like him or not. You say or don’t that, okay, all these politicians take money from “EVERY-WHERE”, and every where is this that and the other in “extreme” as it were. Some is for the write off, some thing legal, and some is for changing policy if they can…so, jew or not, money given…so what? Donated. Who gives a f-? I don’t. Know this, If Obama gets in, he may rue the day he voted in the “bail” out. Because that was bull-shit…because the next administration is bound to it and will surely suffer mightily from it. Oh well. The business of politics, your Reagans or whatnot as that, they’ll all come and go, just like the McGoverns and Obama’s, etc. Same with the Musicians. Who gives a rat’s ass where they sing or what they sing about? You know Faulkner (Originally Falkner, even he changed the name.) said: Gettysburg, you wouldn’t understand it. You’d have to be born there. No duh. But it doesn’t mean you can’t kindly assist art or politics.

I’ll respond to the only bit of that I could follow, Mr. Neal:

_so, jew or not_

After reading Mr. Neal’s comment, I feel like somebody carved a six inch valley through the middle of my skull.

Sorry, that was me. I was trying to dig a grave for Sarah Palin’s political future, and I . . . erm . . . missed.
