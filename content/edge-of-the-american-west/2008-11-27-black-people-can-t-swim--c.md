## Black people can’t swim, &c.

In the summer of 1968, Charles Schulz—born yesterday in 1922—decided not to take the path of least resistance.  In the first months of the Presidential race, the politics of _Peanuts_ were as inscrutable as ever:


[![244071zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244071zoom.gif?w=490 "244071zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244071zoom.gif)[![244072zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244072zoom.gif?w=490 "244072zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244072zoom.gif)[![244075zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244075zoom.gif?w=490 "244075zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244075zoom.gif)

The political positions of the birds—one of whom Schulz would christen “Woodstock” two years later—are literally cryptic.  (Snoopy later [embraced of identity politics](http://assets.comics.com/dyn/str\_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/200000/40000/4000/000/244076/244076.zoom.gif) via a nifty collapse of signifier into signified, but let’s not lit-crit these panels quite yet.)  For Schulz, the campaigns of Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace were less important than baseball:

[![244093zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244093zoom.gif?w=490 "244093zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244093zoom.gif)[![244094zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244094zoom.gif?w=490 "244094zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244094zoom.gif)[![244095zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244095zoom.gif?w=490 "244095zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244095zoom.gif)[![244096zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244096zoom.gif?w=490 "244096zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244096zoom.gif)

This dead-pan surrealism here is _Peanuts_ at its artistic best, but at a time when America was at war and a segregationist was a viable Presidential candidate, dead-pan surrealism wasn’t the order of the day.  So Schulz sent Charlie Brown to the beach:

[![244100zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244100zoom.gif?w=490 "244100zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244100zoom.gif)

This strip’s a fairly typical example of Charlie Brown’s [half-hearted exasperation with an unfair world](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/im\_back\_from\_sa.html).  The next?

[![244101zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244101zoom.gif?w=490 "244101zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244101zoom.gif)

Not only does the world cease its relentless, playful torment of Charlie Brown, but the boy who tamps it down _is black and can swim_.  Because on 31 July 1968, Schulz introduced the world to Franklin.  May not seem like much, but it’s as explicitly political as _Peanuts_ ever ventures.  Until, that is, 1 August 1968:

[![244102zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244102zoom.gif?w=490 "244102zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244102zoom.gif)

The father of Franklin, the black boy who swims, _is over in Vietnam_.  That second panel neatly illustrates how far Schulz strayed from his comfort zone.  Charlie Brown’s father “was in a war, but [he doesn’t] know which one.”  That’s the extent to which contemporary politics typically intruded the most popular daily comic in America.  But for some reason, Schulz felt the need to contradict conventional racist wisdom that summer.

The racists responded in the manner befitting Wallace-backers: “I don’t mind you having a black character, but please don’t show them in school together.”

[![244641zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244641zoom.gif?w=490 "244641zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244641zoom.gif)

It must’ve sucked to be a racist.  Unless, that is, you’re a fan of _Dennis the Menace_:

[![dennis](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/dennis.jpg?w=490 "dennis")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/dennis.jpg)

That’s from 13 May 1970, two years _after_ Schulz quietly integrated public schools.  There’s much to admire in the matter-of-factness of Schulz’s racial politics.  Not only is there no meta- to it, there’s no mention of it—Franklin arrives, befriends Peppermint Patty, and plays football.

A couple of comments;  I never thought of the Peanuts cartoon in the way that you present.  Yes, i was in grade school at that time.  But having a Black kid in school who could swim and who had a dad in Vietnam didn’t strike me as strange at all.

Perhaps the reason is that my dad was career Air Force; I was in grade school; many of my friends were Black and yes, their dads sometimes got assigned to Vietnam just as mine did.

As far as the Dennis the Menace cartoon:  I wish the Black kid hadn’t have been drawn as such a caricature because otherwise it was funny.

I’ve seen the cartoon entitled “Racism rears it’s ugly head” and it has two runners at a track meet arguing “The sprints rule!  No, the relays rock!  No, the marathon is the best” and so on.

Let me point out:  I am not being argumentative; I am pointing out that one’s life experience often colors how one sees things.

I love Peanuts more than ever, but the funny thing about the strip for me is that I loved it as a kid (it was a large factor in my desire to become an illustrator) but, re-reading the strips from that time, I’m not sure what I was responding to. I mean, the punch line is “panel discussion”?

Granted, Charlie Brown on his head is funny, and Snoopy giving it a try is hysterical in a quiet way, but Snoopy rolling his eyes at the end breaks my heart.

The mix of frustration and resignation in so much of Peanuts, the bittersweet quality of the humor, it all seems – I dunno – if not exclusively adult, then at least adolescent. How on earth did this become a world-wide phenomenon?

Also: That Ketcham, eh?

What I find funny (no, not funny, deeply upsetting) here is that Ketcham utilizes line to indicate more than just form, he also indicates tone / shade. The dad’s shirt is very light, Dennis’s hair is almost but not quite as light, the dog’s muzzle is darker than the rest of him, the space between the slats of the fence is darker still. And it all looks “right.”

In other words, Ketcham could have and presumably would have indicated Jackson’s skin using line (a la Schulz) if he had seen him as anything other than black. (Not black like synonym for African-American, but actually black like ink.) You know the urban legend about Inuits / Eskimos having 50 words for snow? This is kind of like that, but in reverse.

This is amazing, Scott, thanks. 

blueollie, “caricature” is too weak a word. That face qualifies, I suppose, but it’s not drawn from observation or imagination — rather minstrelsy, Sambo and (the very oldest) Jemima.

I love this post.  And all the comments.

Anybody know what ever prompted Schultz to perch Snoopy on top of his doghouse?  I mean, there doesn’t seem to be any need to have him there, rather than on the ground with the birds.

it’d be interesting to know how people reacted to these strips. 

the funnies generate letters to editors, out of all proportion one might think, to their place in the paper. 

did letters pour I’m about franklin? about jackson? did any papers refuse to print them? drop the strip?

ketcham’s is appalling. but far more appalling to imagine this in thousands of papers, read by millions of people. 

further appalling thoughts: what if ketcham felt he was doing something progressive? (kids playing together! black people outperforming whites!) what if readers obbjected on those grounds?

_did letters pour I’m about franklin? about jackson? did any papers refuse to print them? drop the strip?_

The [Cleveland _Press_, at least, felt the need to issue an apology for the Ketcham strip.  (](http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/09/he\_really\_is\_a\_menace)[Here’s](http://james-nicoll.livejournal.com/1411412.html?thread=22196052#t22196052) a little more background on what Ketcham thought he was doing with that panel.)

Re:  Snoopy on the doghouse:  I actually had a dog that liked to sleep on the top of his doghouse.  One day my dad challenged the dog to jump on the house by putting a juicy meat bone on top of it.

The dog discovered that it could jump on top of the house and then just started to just for the heck of it.

Eventually it would actually nap there.

I remember 1970, and I think that the apology was for having a black child in the strip, and that he beat Dennis in a race. People did not write letters and protest racist images in the media. The drawing of the black child is ham fisted, most certainly, but I doubt that anyone would have commented on that, let alone protested it.

I do not understand the “Black people can’t swim” reference, but I am sure someone said that some where, probably in the context that there we no black swimmers in competitions. There still are not. 

Looking back on Peanuts strips, especially if you were not reading them in a socio-political context at the time, could be confusing. However, Schultz was a few beats ahead of everyone else, and that is what made his work so compelling. Lil’ Abner was still be drawn. Dondi was still around (albeit not in 1970 if memory serves me right). Doonesbury was in its infancy.  We have come a long way in the past 38 years. That is a generation and one-half. By mid-1970, the racist George Wallace had been in wheelchair two years. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been dead two years. Nixon had been POTUS for one and one-half years. Vietnam kept getting worse, and Nixon was beginning to feel like Johnson Squared. The Kent State Killings were  searing and affected the generation of the Baby Boomer’s parents who thought “that could have been my child.”

The best criticism of Franklin I’ve ever read is from John McWhorter, in an essay called [Black isn’t a Personality Type](http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/miarticle.htm?id=2955).  He starts this way:

_Remember Franklin in the “Peanuts” comic strip? In the wake of the criticism of mainstream popular culture for depicting a “whitewashed” world, Charles Schulz followed a trend by introducing this little fellow in 1968. But what was Franklin “like”? Charlie Brown was a loser, Lucy was bossy, Snoopy was insane–but Franklin was, well, “black.” One of the TV specials had him giving Charlie Brown “five” once. But overall, Franklin had no personality traits at all. Beyond the tint required to render his skin tone, Franklin was a blank.  Schulz meant well. But Franklin was a classic “token black,” and that era saw more than a few Franklins._

Man has a point.

Here is a Schulz interview with Michael Barrier:  

[http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Schulz/interview\_charles\_schulz.htm](http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Schulz/interview\_charles\_schulz.htm)

Relevant excerpt:

BARRIER: Have there been occasions when United Features has sent back a strip, or said, “We’re really worried about this one?”

SCHULZ: Yeah. There were only two occasions. One was a long time ago; Linus’s blanket suddenly took on a life [of its own] and began to attack Lucy. Larry Rutman called; this scared him to death. He thought for sure that it would frighten children, that the blanket doing this would frighten the child reader. Which was ridiculous, when you think of the things that they see in other places. I remember I finished up the little series and let it go at that. Later on, when Franklin was introduced into the strip, the little black kid—I could have put him in long before that, but for other reasons, I didn’t. I didn’t want to intrude upon the work of others, so I held off on that. But I finally put Franklin in, and there was one strip where Charlie Brown and Franklin had been playing on the beach, and Franklin said, “Well, it’s been nice being with you, come on over to my house some time.” Again, they didn’t like that. Another editor protested once when Franklin was sitting in the same row of school desks with Peppermint Patty, and said, “We have enough trouble here in the South without you showing the kids together in school.” But I never paid any attention to those things, and I remember telling Larry at the time about Franklin—he wanted me to change it, and we talked about it for a long while on the phone, and I finally sighed and said, “Well, Larry, let’s put it this way: Either you print it just the way I draw it or I quit. How’s that?” So that’s the way that ended. But I’ve never done much with Franklin, because I don’t do race things. I’m not an expert on race, I don’t know what it’s like to grow up as a little black boy, and I don’t think you should draw things unless you really understand them, unless you’re just out to stir things up or to try to teach people different things. I’m not in this business to instruct; I’m just in it to be funny. Now and then I may instruct a few things, but I’m not out to grind a lot of axes. Let somebody else do it who’s an expert on that, not me.

BARRIER: I’ve read a number of interviews where you say in effect that social issues are not what—

SCHULZ: What are called “social issues” in some of these strips I think are so obvious and so obnoxious that—I think the social issues that I deal with are much more long-lasting and more important than losing the White House. Those are easy targets, no matter which party is in the stew. People say, “Don’t you ever deal in social issues?” “Well, don’t you read the strip?” If you read the strip every day, you’ll see that I deal with more social issues in one month than some of these deal [with] in a whole year. But you have to be a little more sensitive to it.

_Granted, Charlie Brown on his head is funny, and Snoopy giving it a try is hysterical in a quiet way, but Snoopy rolling his eyes at the end breaks my heart._

Michael, I think it’s supposed to.  If you read the bit on my site I linked to up there, you’ll see that I’ve an inkling where that deep-seated resignation to failure originated.  It’s what separates _Peanuts_ from pretty much every other mainstream comic, in that it’s an object lesson in how to accept failure.

_This is amazing, Scott, thanks._

Thanks Vance and Larry.  (And others.)  (Including, according to my long-neglected RSS reader, _metafilter_!?!)  I’m surprised by the response to this, as I almost didn’t post it—to much show, not enough tell, and tell’s supposed to be what us academic folk do.  But the people have spoken, so now all my posts will consist of lightly-glossed comic strips from important moments in American history.  

What’d be really interesting would be to find some way to date the composition of each strip.  We have the publication dates, but I’d love to see what floated through Schulz’s head the day, say, Nixon was impeached.  Was that day’s strip part of a series (like “I’m upside down”), and if so, did he incorporate whatever he felt about Nixon into it?  Or did he back-burner it for a week and address it then?  To my historicist mind, there’s something tantalizing about these day-by-day records of artistic production.  Ultimately a non-starter, most likely, but it’s as close to the dream archive I’ll ever probably come.

_I hope you will highlight it at the OAH._

Larry, I don’t know what that is, but if they’ve invited me, um, can I put it on my CV anyhow?

_BTW, SEK, why are you still reading rec.arts.comics.strips?_

I didn’t realize I was.  I grabbed all those from the _Peanuts_ archive (as the metadata shows).  Or wait, am I being thick again?  (Been grading papers all weekend, so I’m dumber than usual.)

_Man has a point._

Yes and no. Arguably, in 50 years, Schulz created exactly 4 characters: Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy. Every other kid is either an imperfect version of one of these 4 (Violet and Patty as proto-Lucy) or a walking punchline (PigPen, Spike).

What would have been surprising would have been if Franklin _had_ turned into a well-rounded character.

**Matt W**

					

		

What about Schroeder, Sally, and Peppermint Patty? Arguably Frieda as well, and perhaps Marcie, who are nowhere near PigPen/Spike territory, nor even Woodstock. (And Woodstock is a pretty good character for someone who doesn’t speak English.) I will not stand for the minimization of Schulz’s achievement!

OTOH, Franklin is characterized as well as or better than a lot of the minor folk — he seems to have more personality than “5,” for instance. He’s mostly a straight man when he appears but in a way that actually gives him something of a personality distinct from the other characters (I’m thinking of a particular series of strips, probably shortly after the ones Scott posted, where Franklin comes to Charlie Brown’s neighborhood and is freaked out by all the weirdos, the last straw I think being Linus proselytizing about the Great Pumpkin.)

_Or wait, am I being thick again?_

I was just struck by the similarity to [this post](http://james-nicoll.livejournal.com/1411229.html), which the author notes was “[n]icked from rec.arts.comics.strips”.

Looks like we both found the Ketcham from [the same place](http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2008/09/23/an-unexpected-legacy/), and connected the dots.  (In my defense, I actually read through about two years of _Peanuts_ to put this together.  Not that that’s arduous, mind you, but it’s typical of Schulz not wanting to make race an issue that Franklin arrives, disappears for a few months, shows up in town, disappears for a few months, &c.)

Funny to see how we used to express our thoughts about race. One day African Americans will be good swimmers though, becasue that’s the dynamic we live in. No one ever thought a Black golfer would be the best in the world. Whites and Blacks continue to break records in sport and everything because that’s the evolution of human nature. We get better at things, white or black.

_What about Schroeder, Sally, and Peppermint Patty? Arguably Frieda as well, and perhaps Marcie, who are nowhere near PigPen/Spike territory, nor even Woodstock. (And Woodstock is a pretty good character for someone who doesn’t speak English.) I will not stand for the minimization of Schulz’s achievement!_

I stand second to nobody in my admiration for Schulz’s achievement. And, to be honest, I forgot about Sally – she combines distinctive identifying marks (crush on Linus, distaste for school/learning) with a clear character (very little self-awareness – she’s not frequently reflective in the way that the others – even bombastic Lucy – are, despite her flaws).

As for the others? I don’t have the Fantagraphics collections for the Peppermint Patty era (are they out yet?), so this impression is based on TV specials and my own recollections of the daily strip, which date to the 80s, but my sense of Patty is that she’s a gag (“D-“), a caricature (tomboy), and a variation on Lucy (obnoxious, overwhelms C.B.). Arguably, she’s Lucy’s alter ego – bold where Lucy is prissy (“dog lips!”), presumptive of C.B.’s affections without the “you DO think I’m pretty, don’t you?”, and kind to her sidekick. I suppose the alter ego concept makes her interesting, but I’m not sure she qualifies as a truly distinct character in the sense that I meant.

Frieda is half gag (naturally curly hair) and half Lucyesque priss. Marcie is more or less she-Linus (intellectual, insecure yet self-assured, and unable to escape second bananadom). Schroeder is pretty much a normal kid (other than the piano gag), making him the strip’s most reliable straight man. As Snoopy is id to C.B.’s superego, Woodstock is Snoopy’s id.

All of that is fairly reductive, and my original claim probably reflects my pre-1965 bias. But I do think there’s something to it, partly because the evolution of the 4 characters I identified is so clearly seen in the early years – Shermy as proto-Schroeder, Snoopy the dog as proto-Snoopy the fantasist, etc. Lucy actually comes on the scene as a baby, showing a bit of proto-Sally (although she evinces fussbudgeting early).

That said, I agree with the characterization in your second para; other than the odd high five-style signifier, Franklin isn’t characterized as “black;” he’s the stranger in a strange land, where all of these kids are so eccentric (I have no idea if his interactions with Peppermint Patty reflect this; they’re mostly together as representing the “other” neighborhood for purposes of showing a different school and C.B.’s diamond tormentors). His deadpan response to these weirdos is its own character.

Mr. Schultz made very quiet yet impactful social commentary through his alter ego, Charlie Brown. As the predecessor to Doonesbury, Bloom County, the Boondocks and like, the Peanuts show us that kids know how to work out the small stuff and leave the big stuff to unintelligible disembodied voices. It does take a childlike mind to simply want to go outside and play baseball with your friends, regardless or their socio-economic status, religion, skin tone, political affiliation or favorite sports franchise.

We all could stand to K.I.S.S. it every now and then.

Urbino, Snoopy used to sleep inside the doghouse when it was against the side of the house.  One of the storylines had a giant icicle form on the side of the house directly above the doghouse.  After several days of being trapped in his house, afraid to make any movements that might cause the icicle to break off, he decides to make a break for it.  He dashes out of the doghouse and the icicle comes crashing down and destroys his home.  When the Browns build a new house in the yard, Snoopy refuses to sleep inside it and instead climbs on top.

JRoth, I think Peppermint Patty is really a lot closer to Charlie Brown’s alter ego than to Lucy’s. Like Charlie Brown, she’s put upon by the outside world — the D-, and the sequence where she has to go before the school board without violating the dress code (which is where I knew her last name from, without having to look it up); whereas Lucy’s much smaller troubles are generally of her own making. But her reaction to the troubles tends to be much different. That’s part of the reason why I think she counts as a distinct character. I confess to a bit of a post-1965 bias though (I remember more of the 70s strips, which is probably important here, because by the 80s it had really gone downhill IMO). Marcie as she-Linus is right, though.

And I wouldn’t say P. Patty or Sally are on the level of the big four as characters — but those are four of the great characters of literature.

Perceptive thought from Matt W – Peppermint Patty is closer to Charlie Brown in personality than to the others. In fact, she carries the same unrequited love for Charlie Brown that he does for the little red-haired girl, and generally, is as defeated by life as he is, except that she has the athletic skill he lacks.

The difficult thing with “Peanuts” today is to be able to look past all the TV specials, the Metlife ads, the “Happiness is a Warm Puppy” greeting cards, and to see the strip itself for what it was – art made from a profoundly depressive outlook on life. A strip where “Sigh” can be a punchline isn’t a strip concerned with punchlines as we know them. To me, a definitive Schulz quote comes from “Peanuts Jubilee,” where he matter-of-factly writes:

“I went through one strange phase in my life where I became quite disturbed by dreams…. I would find in my dreams that I was crying uncontrollably, and when I awakened, I was extremely depressed…. Sometimes, simply reading the morning paper, or watching the television news, is enough to discourage anyone. We become angry with ourselves,with our family, our fellow workers, with people we meet in stores, and, of course, with the government. It takes a good deal of maturity to be able to set all this anger aside and carry on with your daily work.”

In context, Schulz isn’t trying to make any great point – he’s simply discussing the day-to-day challenges of getting a daily strip done. For him, such depressiveness was the undramatic background to his daily work. And we tend to say, “It’s incredible someone that down could create such a funny strip…” until you realize how many of the strips are simply Charlie Brown standing still describing how the world looks to a depressive. In its own way, “Peanuts” was one of the most subversive American artworks ever.

As far as black swimmers are concerned, Anthony Nesty won a Gold Medal in 1988 competing for Surinam and Enith Brigitha won two Bronze Medals in 1976 competing for the Netherlands.

So that particular canard has been untrue for a long time.
