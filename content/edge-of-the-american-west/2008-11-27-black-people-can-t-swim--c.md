## Black people can’t swim, &c.

In the summer of 1968, Charles Schulz—born yesterday in 1922—decided not to take the path of least resistance.  In the first months of the Presidential race, the politics of _Peanuts_ were as inscrutable as ever:

The political positions of the birds—one of whom Schulz would christen “Woodstock” two years later—are literally cryptic.  (Snoopy later [embraced of identity politics](http://assets.comics.com/dyn/str\_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/200000/40000/4000/000/244076/244076.zoom.gif) via a nifty collapse of signifier into signified, but let’s not lit-crit these panels quite yet.)  For Schulz, the campaigns of Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace were less important than baseball:

This dead-pan surrealism here is _Peanuts_ at its artistic best, but at a time when America was at war and a segregationist was a viable Presidential candidate, dead-pan surrealism wasn’t the order of the day.  So Schulz sent Charlie Brown to the beach:

This strip’s a fairly typical example of Charlie Brown’s [half-hearted exasperation with an unfair world](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/im\_back\_from\_sa.html).  The next?

[![244101zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244101zoom.gif?w=490 "244101zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244101zoom.gif)

Not only does the world cease its relentless, playful torment of Charlie Brown, but the boy who tamps it down _is black and can swim_.  Because on 31 July 1968, Schulz introduced the world to Franklin.  May not seem like much, but it’s as explicitly political as _Peanuts_ ever ventures.  Until, that is, 1 August 1968:

[![244102zoom](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244102zoom.gif?w=490 "244102zoom")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/244102zoom.gif)

The father of Franklin, the black boy who swims, _is over in Vietnam_.  That second panel neatly illustrates how far Schulz strayed from his comfort zone.  Charlie Brown’s father “was in a war, but [he doesn’t] know which one.”  That’s the extent to which contemporary politics typically intruded the most popular daily comic in America.  But for some reason, Schulz felt the need to contradict conventional racist wisdom that summer.

The racists responded in the manner befitting Wallace-backers: “I don’t mind you having a black character, but please don’t show them in school together.”

It must’ve sucked to be a racist.  Unless, that is, you’re a fan of _Dennis the Menace_:

That’s from 13 May 1970, two years _after_ Schulz quietly integrated public schools.  There’s much to admire in the matter-of-factness of Schulz’s racial politics.  Not only is there no meta- to it, there’s no mention of it—Franklin arrives, befriends Peppermint Patty, and plays football.
