I’m embarrassed to admit I never considered visiting the myth-making factory before my friend Todd offered [a guided tour](http://tonguebutnodoor.net/?p=157).  (Cheap shots on the house!)  As often as conservatives bemoan the liberal media’s manipulation of plain fact — there are only so many scare quotes in the world, no need to waste them all in one sentence — you think they’d know better than to house their [dishonest edits](http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Barack\_Obama&diff=470044&oldid=470036) in an online terrarium. But you know what would be awesome?  If [the person](http://www.conservapedia.com/User:Aschlafly) who kept deleting the passage in which Obama is vindicated was the son of a conservative icon like [Phyllis Schlafly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis\_Schlafly).

[What](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aschlafly)!?!

Honestly, the really amazing thing is, the guy seriously thinks he’s protecting people from the liberal bias that would allow you to interpret that UoC statement as vindicating Obama. It’s just an amazing perverted world-view. Which is what makes trolling Conservapedia so much fun.

It’s so hard not to unleash my flying monkeys of hate on someone like Schlafly.  But really, I’m bigger than that.  So I just pity him.

But really, did you think someone with his claws drawing blood from the Schlafly fortune would resort to transparent internet shenanigans?  I didn’t.  It saddens me that these are the opposition’s crack agents, yet we’ve still lost twice now.

I think it’s time to face facts and buy us training wheels.

The worm has turned, I think.  At least I hope so.  And by the way, we didn’t lose in 2000.  2004, it seems to me, was a case in which a wartime president beat a mediocre windsurfer.  That’s not to take anything away from Senator Kerry, but his response to being Swiftboated in summer 2004 — “Oh, they’re attacking my stellar war record.  And the seated president is clearing brush. I know, I’ll go on a long vacation to the ersatz West, ride my $6,000 bicycle in public, and keep my own counsel.  Mom always said, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” — left a bit to be desired.  Am I bitter?  Only insofar as I didn’t even consider voting for Edwards because of his performance in the veep debate last time around.  Kelmans never forget.

Sad: millions of Americans go from cradle to grave having never seen or heard an information source any better than that one.

Also, they vote.

Breaking news: conservapedia dishonest?  Fish, barrel, etc.

“It saddens me that these are the opposition’s crack agents, yet we’ve still lost twice now.”

Their dishonesty is their strength.  Sure, you or I would research facts, correct errors, etc.  They don’t waste time or effort doing any of that.  It takes you more effort to shoot down their lies than it takes them to make new ones, and anyway, you haven’t shot them down — it’s all he said / you said.

It’s not that they’re not doing research — it’s that they’re actively and transparently manipulating the facts.  Shouldn’t even their ideological allies look crossly at them?

No, of course not.  All of the victories of the Right are based on this kind of thing.  The persistent inability of the non-Right to internalize that is what makes it effective.

I mean, no one cares.  So he lied.  He’s going to keep on lying.  And it will work.  The only reason that it may have momentarily stopped working is because the lies leave the Right unable to govern in reality, so problems have been building up.  Isn’t it time to get past “Look, he lied!” and to start to think about what that means in terms of the American public and what it wants to hear?

People have certain tools and want to use them.  You have the ability to detect manipulation of historical facts.  All right, that’s fine for certain purposes.  But not necessarily for political purposes.    The Left as a whole is highly over-invested in lie-detecting skills and under-invested in political ones.  Of course you can’t change what your skill set is, but it would be nice if these kind of pieces went beyond “he lied!” to some kind of consideration of what that meant politically, if anything.

Andy Schlafly is hardly a “crack agent” in the conservative movement. In fact I haven’t seen much evidence that anyone takes him seriously when he is not accompanied by his mother. But he has inadvertently created an interesting proof of concept of the idea of Wikiality — that if you don’t care for the facts around you you can make your own alternate reality.

He [said](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/2008/05/the\_conservativ.html): “I don’t have to live with what’s printed in the newspaper. I don’t have to take what’s written in Wikipedia. We’ve got our own way to express knowledge.”

In embracing the DIY factuality of the wiki, Schlafly is being far more direct than, say, Fox News.

Rich, I won’t speak for Scott.  But, come on.  His post was high-octane snark.  It was written in fun. He says as much in text.  And anyway, trying to divine the political significance of the nonsense created by deluded morons is a sucker’s game, I think.  That said, your broader point about the Right’s willingness to ignore the importance of veracity (and maybe the rules of physics, if such a move suits their political ends) is right on.  This just gets us back to the long-ago quote (twelve seconds of googling hasn’t turned up the original source — sorry) about Democrats being trapped in the paradigm of the reality-based community while the Bush administration makes its own reality.  The person being quoted in that case, who I think was some low-level factotum, was crowing about power.  But he was a fool.  Because the reality-based community is where one should want to be.  And not just because the parties are better.      

Seriously, it’s not that I’m content being part of a quiescent opposition party on a sinking ship of state.  But because, as you say, the right is “unable to govern in reality.”  I think that’s always true.  If one ignores basic facts about one’s reality, it becomes pretty hard to get from here to there, much less make a big country function properly.  In short, being part of the reality-based community is a long-term virtue, not just morally or epistemologically, but in terms of basic day-to-day politics.

The source of that phrase is [this article by Ron Suskind](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?ex=1255665600&en=890a96189e162076&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland), where it’s credited to “a senior adviser to Bush”.

“Senior adviser to Bush” = low-level factotum, right?  At least in Ari Land, where I make my own reality.  And thanks for the link, Vance.  Your google-fu makes a mockery of my keyboard fumblings.

“But, come on. His post was high-octane snark. It was written in fun.”

Snark is a defense mechanism.  I was trying to challenge him to get beyond it.  If you can only laugh at something that, really, you think there should be indignation about — but you know that if presented as a cause of straightforward indignation, no one could actually manage it — then there’s a hole at the bottom of your snark.

It’s as if day after day Right politicians physically mugged people with blackjacks and took their money.  You could catch one in the act and publish their picture and write a snarky article, “Look, the art of politics.”  And underneath that would be the idea that, as Scott says, the others on the Right should be ashamed of this guy for getting caught, for being too obvious, if for no other reason.  

But if that’s all they ever do — if, in the analogy, mugging people is how they win time after time?  Then the snark is pointless.  You’d be better off saying “Hmm, this is serious politics going on here.  How does it work?”  Because noticing it only to laugh means that you’ve laughed and now you can go on; that the incident has been placed symbolically though not actually beyond the pale and there’s nothing more to see here.

I see and cede your point (sort of).  But I’d counter with two of my own:  First, snark is funny.  And humor isn’t just about a good laugh; it’s also about politics, about convincing people that you’re right and they’re wrong, or silly, or venal, or whatever.  Whoever “they” might be.  And second, by pointing out that people like Schlafly and his ilk — and in this tendency to trod all over the basic conventions of inquiry Schlafly has a lot of ilk on the Right — live in a world divorced from reality, we see, yet again, how very unsafe it is to trust such people with the keys to the country.  By the way, do ships have keys?  Otherwise I’ve just mixed my metaphor:  ships above, something with keys here.

All of which is to say, sure, you’re right:  it’s important to understand the politics of posturing on the right and cowering on the left.  Again, though, as I noted yesterday, the worm is turning.  And one of the reason for the change, I think, is that people are tired of being governed by idiots who think that they can cut their own reality from whole cloth.

Also, as William James [said](http://www.authorama.com/pragmatism-3.html), “I fully believe in the legitimacy of taking moral holidays.”  Not every political remark needs to be aimed like an arrow at the heart of the opposition.  Sometimes it’s enough just to have a bit of fun.

Agreeing in part with Rich, it’s harder to laugh about this kind of thing in some parts of the country than it is in others, except in a very gallows humor way.

“And one of the reason for the change, I think, is that people are tired of being governed by idiots who think that they can cut their own reality from whole cloth.”

We seem to mostly agree, but there’s the disagreement.  I don’t think people are tired of that at all.  I think that they are tired of dealing with the actual results of bad governance.  But they make no connection between one and the other: as soon as those results are more or less fixed, the American people are going to go right back to the pols who flaunt their belief that they can make up their own reality.

And what Scott presents as a disadvantage — being obvious, getting caught — is in fact an advantage.  If whatshisname could plaster over the front of conservapedia “I’m making stuff up about Obama and I don’t care who corrects me” that would be even better.  Because that indicates “strength”.  Snarking at it may or may not be funny, but it shows that you fundamentally don’t get what’s going on.

Well, I think it just took a lot of so-called low-information voters a bit more time to catch on than I would have liked.  But high-profile stories — lying the nation into war, insisting on keeping Terry Schiavo alive, Katrina, etcetera — have underscored the GOP’s mendacity, disregard for reality, and general incompetence.  It’s become much harder to ignore how bad Republicans are at running the country, in other words.

All of that said, the American people — even the American electorate — are hardly monolithic.  Which point might speak to something Urbino suggested above:  living in California, it’s easier for me, or for Scott, to laugh about people like Schlafly.  I didn’t find these sorts of thing nearly so funny when I lived in Oklahoma or even Colorado.  Of course, Colorado has since become much more Democratic, a data point that may work in favor of my argument.

Rich has a point in that while there’s nothing wrong with taking “moral holidays” as James put it, to a certain extent that’s all we do.  We keep forgetting to go back to work afterwards.

As a math person, the funniest fact is that on their big list of examples of liberal bias on Wikipedia, they include the page on Fermat’s Last Theorem.
