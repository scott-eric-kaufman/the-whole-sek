I’m embarrassed to admit I never considered visiting the myth-making factory before my friend Todd offered [a guided tour](http://tonguebutnodoor.net/?p=157).  (Cheap shots on the house!)  As often as conservatives bemoan the liberal media’s manipulation of plain fact — there are only so many scare quotes in the world, no need to waste them all in one sentence — you think they’d know better than to house their [dishonest edits](http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Barack\_Obama&diff=470044&oldid=470036) in an online terrarium. But you know what would be awesome?  If [the person](http://www.conservapedia.com/User:Aschlafly) who kept deleting the passage in which Obama is vindicated was the son of a conservative icon like [Phyllis Schlafly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis\_Schlafly).

[What](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aschlafly)!?!
