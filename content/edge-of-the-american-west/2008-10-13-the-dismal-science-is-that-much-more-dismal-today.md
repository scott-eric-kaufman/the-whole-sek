Remember those [
100
 **90** economists](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/96557315-1694-4d8f-9b0a-c29f0f0872e6.htm) who support John McCain’s economic package?  Remember how proud the McCain camp was so proud of the fact that five of them were Nobel Prize winners?

That was last week.  No conservative will ever take [an economist seriously again](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/paul-krugman-wins-economics-nobel/?em).

Somebody has to do a post summarizing the rightwing head explosions now occurring on the ‘net.  Scott?

The NYT comments are monitored and boring, Luskin is so mad he can’t spell, and Marginal Revolution has the loonies out in force.

silbey, I love [teaching that film](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/few\_would\_dispu.html).

John, NO SPOILERS!  (Although, to spoil it myself a bit, the emphasis on the not-a-real-Nobel line is hilarious.)

Of course they’re going crazy: it’s the rise of Great K’thrugman.

Exploding heads still can eternal lie,  

But with strange Nobels even shite goes shy

Great movie.  Lee Ermey is spectacular.

_the emphasis on the not-a-real-Nobel line is hilarious_

I guess that means Uncle Milt wasn’t so brilliant, after all.

I don’t really follow academic economics.  All I know, really, is that there’s a fairly long line of University of Chicago (read: conservative) economists who won the medal.  Who was the last liberal American economist to win it?  (Yes, yes, I know, “define liberal.”  Work with me here, people.)

Sen has been mentioned, but there are more.

Thanks.

BTW, Scott, shouldn’t the title be “[The Dismal Science, Yet More Dismal](http://books.google.com/books?id=N8JzGQAACAAJ&dq=the+bloody+tenet+yet+more+bloody)“?

Volokh Conspiracy commentators are nuttier than Cowen commentators. Reality is outstripping SEK’s ability to respond.

Scott, you’re off the hook for a bit.  The volume of insane ranting is too much for any person to handle quickly.

[DeLong](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/crooked-timber.html) is giving it a shot (though with characteristic nonchalance about quoting and linking).  John, you caught the contagion too, quoting but not linking [the Forbes editorial](http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx\_wla\_1013anderson.html)….
