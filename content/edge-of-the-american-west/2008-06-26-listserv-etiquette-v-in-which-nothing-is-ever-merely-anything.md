## Listserv Etiquette V: In which nothing is ever “merely” anything

 * Thursday, June 26, 2008

Every department houses one person who doesn’t understand the purpose of the departmental listserv.  What is, for the majority of its recipients, a simple means of alerting interested parties to talks, job offers, and other relevant departmental business is, for this person, a public confessional.  If an email opens:

LGBT Event at Cross-Cultural Center

This person’s outraged response will look like this:

LGBT**Q** Event at Cross-Cultural Center

Or perhaps like this:

**G**LBT**Q?** Event at Cross-Cultural Center

Point being, this person will find fault with whatever the first email said because the entire department must be constantly reminded that his or her devotion to justice entails questioning of any potentially privileging statement.  If the “G” follows the “L,” the author replicates—and in replicating legitimizes or, even worse, _appears_ to legitimize—divisive structures of representation within the queer community (as broadly as the word can be defined).

Such grievous offense requires a brave crusader to parse every last permutation and then decide, in the end, that since every possible combination privileges _something_, __ the only thing to do is consider the sending of any email ever a pregnant “teaching moment” and append something like the 5,000 words he or she has just written to every one of them … for great justice.

Should someone respond to this email with a sarcastic recommendation that the letters be stacked, so as to avoid the any possibility of untoward LTR directional privilege, this person will write _another_ 5,000 words, this time about how unfunny the resulting mess would be:

![Stacked\_2](https://i2.wp.com/acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/26/stacked\_2.jpg)

Only it is not merely unfunny—nothing is ever “merely” anything for this person—it is also symptomatic of the desire by hegemons to obliterate the unique identities of the various groups represented by each letter by transforming their hard-won bonds into an amorphous blob of non-identity, thereby effacing the personal struggles of people, like this person, some of which he or she will now share with the entire department no matter how inappropriate discussing the loss of your virginity on a departmental listserv might seem.

Positive responses to this cathartic effusion will be deemed patronizing; negative, evidence of insensitivity born of privilege; silence, a vile attempt to shame this person back into closet in which the queer-uncomfortable majority clearly believes he or she belongs.  Any attempts to pull this person aside—via email, in the break room, it matters not—and convince him or her that no offense was offered or intended will result in _yet another_ 5,000 word missive about the _conspiracy_ to silence him or her.  Were someone to pipe in with a reminder of listserv decorum, complete with a lengthy quotation of its charter, the conspiracy becomes _institutional_ and _still another_ 5,000 word letter must be written, this time only CC’d to the listserv as a courtesy when it is sent to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity.

When this person finally leaves the department, he or she will write a lengthy email reminiscing about how crucial the listserv was to development personal and professional and apologize if exchanges were ever unnecessarily heated.  Sooner or later, word will come through grapevine or the _Chronicle of Higher Ed_ that this person has moved up in the world—what was once limited to interdepartmental listservs is now featured on the local news.

And I will laugh at the poor television producers who have no idea what they’ve gotten themselves into.

1.  Do things like this ever happen out-side of California?  

2.  Only tangentially related:  Harpers reprinted, many years ago, a memo from Student Governance that went out at Harvard Divinity School.  (Cue Twilight Zone theme.)  There were two boxes for recycling paper, one labeled “white paper,” the other, “colored paper.”  Some wag changed the latter sign to “paper of color,” and the memo was excoriating said wag for inappropriate humor, insensitivity to language issues, etc., etc.  The memo concluded by admitting there just might be a legitimate social justice concern regarding how the sign should be phrased, and that if that were the motivation for the change, would the individual please contact said Student Governance board.

1.  _Do things like this ever happen out-side of California?_ 

I don’t know — I can only speak to my experience on this departmental listserv.  _But_ there are similar folks on H-NET’s listservs — I’m looking at you AMER-STUD! — so I think it’s likely widespread.  Like trolls, only on listservs.

2.  That’s a damn funny story.  We ought to try collect all such stories into a compendium of only-insiders-_really_-get-it academic humor.

Confusing the map with the territory, the symbol with the thing symbolized, is a very common kind of stupidity.

And the connection between stupid and evil is deep.

No doubt on the kidding front, it just seemed kind of random.  (So much so I wondered whether Charlie didn’t know something I didn’t, like who Meekins is.)

No, you’re kidding, right?  On my past departmental listservs, that example email would return one of the following:

  \* “I don’t think such subject matter is appropriate for a department-wide email list.”  

  \* “When are they going to have a Straight Whites event at that center?  There should be events for normal people too.  That’s discrimination.”  

\* “What’s an LQBST?  A lobster?”

Sigh.

Not only am I not kidding, but when I get tenure, I’m going to publish from my vast archives of supreme idiocy … once I remove all identifying information, of course, since I’m a nice guy and all.

The problem with “of color” is that it reifies the categorization of “white” as the unmarked marking, colorless and therefore universal. It also resembles the phrase “off color”, commonly used in the phrase “off color joke”, the targets of which are often people “of color.”

Also, my departmental listserv was often taken up for important discussions of what was or was not appropriate to be posted on a departmental listserv. A common counterargument was “how long does it take to press the delete button?”
