Am I the only one who thinks Glenn Reynolds only knew [this quotation](http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/025224.php) because it’s the name of a [popular science fiction trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His\_Dark\_Materials)?  Because it certainly doesn’t mean what he thinks it means, as William Graham Sumner—one of the three people on whom the label “social Darwinist” can be pinned in good faith—[noted in 1877](http://books.google.com/books?id=iqUSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA472&vq=umpire&dq=%!C(MISSING)haos+Umpire+sits,+And+by+decision+more+embroils+the+fray.%!&(MISSING)num=100&client=firefox-a&source=gbs\_search\_s&cad=1):

Fluctuations in the measure of value are as inconvenient and fatal as fluctuations in the measure of length and bulk . . . . Business is turned into a guess, or a game of hazard, where the prevailing anarchy is overruled by accident:—

“Chaos umpire sits  

And by decision more embroils the fray  

By which he reigns; next him high arbiter  

Chance governs all.”

In such a condition of things the gamblers have the advantage.  The stock exchange becomes little better than a faro bank . . . . The temptation of excessive gains leads from the beaten path of business.  Speculation without money takes the place of honest industry, extending from the stock exchange everywhere . . . . Honesty ceases to be even a policy.  (_Works_ 472)

This is not to say Reynolds is [interested in honesty](http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/whiskey\_fire/2008/10/a-gift-to-every.html), merely that [he doesn’t seem to know what words mean](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/grading.html).
