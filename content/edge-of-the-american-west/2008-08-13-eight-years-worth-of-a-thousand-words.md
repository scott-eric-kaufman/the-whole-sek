Give it up already, Mr. President.  Even _Kissinger_ is cringing.

Yes, he’s holding the flag backwards. But to HIM it looks right.  Remember: it’s always about HIM.

Always the frat boy. Only having his face painted and sporting a funny hat could make him look any more like the typical drunken oaf we usually see in crowd shots at sporting events.

Could that younger guy sitting 2 seats over from Kissinger look any more Republican? Is it even possible to look any more Republican?

That picture is worth a thousand words, all right. As long as those words are George Carlin’s list repeated 142.86 times.

Gah, I just read a tragicomic post somewhere — ah, [here](http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2008/08/11/8537) it is — talking about an alternative universe in which President Bush would have parlayed his connections and interests into becoming commissioner of baseball or the head of the IOC.  Y’know, I’m not sure what I found funny about that post the first time.  It’s actually just tragic to think of how much happier he’d be and how much better off the world would be.

I happened to be watching the Olympics when Kissinger walked up the aisle. The initial salutations between the President and former Secretary of State were somewhat bizarre. Of course, the cameramen couldn’t pick up sound from such a far distance, but here’s how I interpreted their bodily movements and brief conversation (as best as I can remember):

President sees Kissinger walking up the aisle and excitedly stands up for whatever reason (our First Lady as well as the rest of the Executive entourage remain in their seats). Kissinger walks up, turns left into his row just below the Bushes, shuffles to his seat at a lumbering gait. In the first two seconds or so, he seems to either not see good ‘ol George or completely ignores him. Bush says something, Kissinger cranes his neck upwards, and the President sticks out his hand like he’s greeting a frat brother who he randomly ran into at a college football game. Kissinger smiles of course, gives a reply (something humorous, I believe) , arrives at his seat a couple of seconds later.

I really got the feeling that Kissinger was unsure as to whether he actually wanted to speak to our President. I also wondered: what, the President didn’t know that Henry f—ing Kissinger planned on sitting in the row just below him?

I agree with SEK. Eight years of this kind of crap. Even certain members of the GOP want you to give it a rest.

Kissinger may be brain-dead by now. Did he seem to be wearing pampers, or did he have a handler leading him around?

Now that you mention it:  That guy looks photoshopped.  Chin looks fake, hairline looks fake.  Maybe I’m crazy- it is the internet.

And is that Mrs. Kissinger between Kissinger and photoshopped Republican?  I remember when he married her, and both of them were considered to be quite the catch for each other.  This presumably ended Kissinger’s wild single days in Washington.  It seemed like there could be nobody least deserving of his publicity as a “ladies man” than Henry Kissinger.  Then, along came “sexiest man alive” Donald Rumsfeld.

Bush looked totally bored through much of the opening ceremonies, all slouched down and looking like he was lounging in his backyard or something. I was embarassed for Laura.  And now this.  January 20 (?), 2009 can’t come soon enough.
