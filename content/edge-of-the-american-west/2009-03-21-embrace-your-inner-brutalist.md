## Embrace your inner brutalist.

Brutalism may be “underloved,” as Christopher Shea [recently described it](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2009/03/brutalism\_lives.html), but you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone at UC Irvine who would argue against the notion that brutalist buildings come “across as oppressive and dreary.”  How oppressive are they?  Remember my [earlier post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/where-i-am-i-dont-know-ill-never-know-in-the-silence-you-dont-know-you-must-go-on-i-cant-go-on.html) about where the grade inflation study was performed?  You know what else happened there?

![conquestoftheplanetoftheapes1972dvd2](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/conquestoftheplanetoftheapes1972dvd2.jpg?w=490 "conquestoftheplanetoftheapes1972dvd2")

I am, as the kids say, _seriously_:

![apes01](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/apes01.jpg?w=490 "apes01")

So if you don’t know why brutalism feels oppressive, ask an ape.  Why do I point this out?  To prove that my campus runs brutal circles around Ari and Eric’s.  How much more brutal is it?  Here’s a picture of [the statue they erected in my backyard last week](http://www.ocregister.com/photos/orc-alert-foot-2318309-orc-on-wolf-spotted-in-irvine/pid2318490):

![worldofwarcraft](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/worldofwarcraft.jpg?w=490 "worldofwarcraft")

I imagine they sat down and said:

“You know, Irvine’s already pretty darn brutal, but it’s not brutal _enough_.  What can we do?  Jenkins!”

“Statue of a pony, sir?”

“Ridiculous.  Ponies aren’t brutal.  Smith!”

“What about an orc, sir?”

“An orc?  I don’t know what that is, Smith, but it sounds Anglo-Saxon.  I think I like it!”

“What if we stuck an orc on a pony, sir?”

“What is it with you and ponies, Jenkins?”

“If I can interject, sir, Jenkins might have a point.  What if we mount the orc on a Volvo-sized wolf?  Wouldn’t that be pretty darn brutal?”

“Could we show it eating Jenkin’s pony?”

“I don’t see why not.”

That’s some hardcore brutality.

Let me put it this way: The architect behind my present place of employment is best known for designing toilets. And: They really, _really_ knew concrete back in the 1970’s.

Being moved to a trailer-park placed on one of the parking lots almost felt like a promotion.

My candidate for brutal campus would be the University of Massachusetts/Boston Harbor Campus.  On a beautiful setting overlooking the harbor(the Kennedy Library is down the street), is a group of concrete boxes set on concrete pillars. On a big windswept concrete plaza.

Combining an ugly design(originally is was to be a prison, according to legend) and scandal plagued substandard construction, it also has been indifferently maintained.

It’s like attending school in the 1970s…1970s Poland.

Come on, how cool is it that your campus has a statue of an orc riding a warg?  He could be a role model for your students.  And the warg could be a role model for those of your students who are going into genetic engineering.  And the next grad student protest might get taken more seriously if you brandished huge axes and wore spiked-up football gear.  Just saying.

Then, at Berkeley, there is famously [Evans Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans\_Hall\_(UC\_Berkeley)) 

Money quote “Evans is widely regarded as one of the most depressing buildings on campus due to a number of windowless classrooms. In addition there is a basement computing facility often referred to as “The Dungeon.” The printers are named with various underworld overtones such as Styx, Cerberus and Charon.”  But there is a vigorous competition for the ugliest building on the Berkeley campus, as indeed over the whole of the UC and state college systems.

Evans isn’t the building I’d have picked out at Cal… I’d have to go for [Wurster](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wurster\_Hall\_SW.jpg).  (The punchline, of course, being that it’s the home of the architecture department.)

I dunno, the Death Star seems pretty brutal to me, although I didn’t come across any connection to brutalism in the paper I wrote about it. Some such thing about “concrete realism” instead. 

But that paper wasn’t so great, as I don’t really understand architects. They apparently occupy a different planet than me and we have very substantial differences in our understandings of what makes a nice building. My architectural history professor thinks the Death Star is the most delightful, beautiful building on campus.

From my grad school days, the UMass Amherst Fine Arts Center  [http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3296006972\_70f53aeb60.jpg](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3296006972\_70f53aeb60.jpg)

Every side looks like the back.  It does the windswept-plaza thing so popular in MA (UMass Boston as mentioned above, or Boston City Hall).  Neo-bru’s “keep out” message works best, I think, when carefully harmonized with inhospitable open space.

Anyhow, it terms of ugliness at UCSD, there are so many good options that you’re skipping over.  The ridiculous library?  John Muir College?  The old student center Ewok village?  So many options.

Oh, I totally forgot: the [Mandeville center](http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives\_exhibits/campus\_planning/atkinson\_archive/ucsd/photos/UCSD\_27\_rf.jpg) at UCSD rocks the whole Death Star architectural style (pointless holes in the ground!

Agreed, the Mandeville center is awful,and the big rock bear is lovely; but the library? The library is totally the awesome. It looks like a spaceship, how can you not be pleased? And John Muir isn’t so bad, although for sure could be better; but the Ewok village is cozy and friendly, although don’t worry, they’ve been planning on burning it down for years now.

_Not to mention Uris._

Quote from the Cornell web page summary of Uris:

“In the tradition begun by Mies van der Rohe, Bunschaft has exposed the Cor Ten I-beams (which have developed a purplish-brown patina) and filled in the space between with glass.”

This “purplish-brown patina” is known more commonly as “rust.”

**[andrew](http://thewayside.wordpress.com)**

					

		

I remember Evans (and possibly even Barrows) being worse on the interior than Wurster, but I spent less time in Wurster. There’s some story about the slabs over the windows on Wurster – they all had to be replaced because they weren’t stable enough? orginally they were supposed to be canopies? – but I can’t remember it.

Isn’t there also some poor planning story about the UCSD library? Something like they didn’t take into account the weight of the books, so they’re not shelved in the way they were supposed to have been?

What else can I throw into this comment? I kind of like the look of Ives Hall, though with all of these I’d really have to see them in person to really judge. And Pattee Library makes me think of an oversized water pumping station.

What is not an urban legend is that the concrete on the UCSD library wasn’t engineered correctly, leading to chunks of it falling off of those suspended floors.  They had to do a big ol’ mitigation a couple of years ago.

To be completely honest I don’t really mind a lot of this stuff.  I like the UCSD library, I kind of like Boston City Hall, I don’t really mind UMass Boston now that they’ve updated it, I like John Muir College at UCSD, I like the other UCSD spots I mentioned.

Mandeville Center, though, really does suck.  It’s totally unusable. The library’s pretty unusable, too, but at least it’s entertainingly odd.

UMass Boston is a disaster, yes. And I think the books-too-heavy-for-the-building story actually took place at UMass Amherst, where for years there was chainlink around the tower and a tunnel for an entrance. But my own campus has its claim to brutal fame: Mosse Humanities at UW-Madison. A bunker on stilts, with half the arrow-slit windows facing stone walls just opposite.

I’m not that kind of nerd.  When I finished my dissertation, I spent a couple of weeks thoroughly engrossed in [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Elder\_Scrolls\_4), which is pretty damn nerdy.  But no, WOW isn’t in my nerd purview.

Any campus that was expanding in the 1960s and 1970s has some of these stylistically innovative visually crushing concrete monstrosities.  Emory’ s worst offender (on a generally lovely campus), the chemistry building has been replaced (and also seemingly scrubbed from the internet), but I think the [theology building](http://www.umc.org/atf/cf/%!B(MISSING)DB6A45E4-C446-4248-82C8-E131B6424741%!D(MISSING)/umns\_314\_080686\_468.jpg) remains, as does [blocktacular](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wangkai/310056878) [White Hall](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24475937@N02/2317324863).

Soon these building will be endangered and not only will there be historic preservation commissions taking up their cause, but, just as we now bemoan the idiots who tore wrap-around porches off of houses or covered over pressed tin ceilings with acoustic tile, an aesthetic revival will mourn their loss and wax rhapsodic about their entrancing greyness.

Incidentally I’m not actually sure the building pictured in the post counts as Brutalist.  Modern, yes, but I think of Wurster or Boston City Hall as being much more representative of the Brutalist style.

Certainly, the WoW art is no kind of Brutalist.

Wikipedia makes a claim for [UCSD’s library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalism#Campus\_Brutalism) as a Brutalist icon, which wouldn’t have occured to me.

Denver’s art museum, the original structure, not the new whacked-out wing designed by Daniel Liebskind’s (ego),  is the quintessential brutalist structure in the West, I believe.  Oddly, I can’t find an image to illustrate my point.  It appears that people are more taken with the new building than the old.  Anyway, what we have in the post above is just a high-modern concrete pour, right?  And if that’s what we’re after, the University of Illinois-Chicago (the so-called Circle Campus) is really the place to go.

Oh, and the Death Star, despite its nickname, doesn’t even flirt with brutalism.  It’s just a poorly designed structure that sits on the fault between modernism and post-modernism.  It’s supposed to make the spirit soar through whimsical references.  Or something.  And in the right light (dusk in high summer) from the right angle and distance, it sort of does.  But if you have to use the place for anything, beware.

_what’s so bad about the Sun God?_

It’s just some visceral reaction I have to it, the bear, the talking tree, etc. Until this thread, I didn’t even recognize the _Legacy of Brutality_ that surrounds them. Maybe that’s why they bug me: the bear, for instance, is surrounded by bizarre unworkable post-modern ego-monuments, so putting a cutsey rock sculpture in between seems like a misdirect. The Sun God looks like spray-painted bondo amid mountains of concrete—not that I have anything against [mountains of concrete](http://www.nexusjournal.com/2008/Images/Salk\_Institute.jpg) _per se_, I’m just not sure they make for workplaces with that “quality that can’t be named”. The cutsey tokens dotted around the campus seem like sops to humanism or the human-scale; little reminders that, “sure, you’re trapped in the death star but on your way through the [food court transfer corridor](http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/graphics/images/2008/05-08PriceCenterHallway.jpg) please be assured that UCSD FDandC recognizes what some have called human dignity”.

Sifu, Geisel library will be a great urban ruin at some point. I like to watch first-time visitors—once they’ve found the library—try to get inside of it; there are at least two “head fakes” from the east or west side before you’re likely to get inside.

Most of the UCSD buildings work from a distance, but are miserable work environments compared to even a strip-mall-style office park. UCSD has lots of great little spaces—e.g., the crafts studio over by the old student union, [this place at SIO](http://www.sio.ucsd.edu/About/Resources/Venue\_Rentals/Martin\_Johnson/images/martinJohnson\_16.jpg), and Sequoyah hall—but they’re being replaced over time. I can’t find too many photos of the buildings I like that aren’t full of people doing things together, using the space around the building (try that in the Bear quad), or whatnot.

_Most of the UCSD buildings work from a distance, but are miserable work environments compared to even a strip-mall-style office park._

I think this is right.  The campus seems designed to be experienced outdoors which, hey, San Diego, why go inside, right?

The buildings that work reasonably well as interior spaces — the biomedical library, some of those horrible buildings surrounded the big rock bear — are fantastically, seemingly intentionally ugly from the outside.  I don’t blame the Brutalist buildings for that, though.  There’s a certain character to the later buildings that I internally categorize as “late 90s software company headquarters” that’s just so profoundly boring and ugly.  No, architect, a curved wall doesn’t actually make the whole enterprise interesting.  I don’t care if you make it out of glass.

I went to UCSD and thought that the architecture mostly sucked, BUT THEN I WENT [HERE](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus\_de\_Jussieu), which was much, much worse. None of the photos really show off that Pantopticon/Isengard flavor that was so characteristically oppressive. It may help to explain it if I point out that there was only one exit to the campus, which was otherwise sealed around with  classrooms like a fort, and that the classrooms and hallways were all designed to be identical so that only by keeping track of what “tower” one had entered could one navigate around. And then there’s the central office skyscraper, smack in the middle of the windswept courtyard. It housed admin—I’m not even kidding. Just an awful, awful place. UCSD seems whimsical in comparison.

Wow, the Salk Institute has a kind of grand hideousness to it.  

Two thoughts:

It occurred to me to wonder if anyone had produced a coffee table book of these imposing eyesores, perhaps entitled _Sucking the Light_ or _Impressions of Building Materials_.  Of course [they](http://books.google.com/books?id=NtuiYbl8PnYC&printsec=frontcover&vq=%!C(MISSING)oncrete+architecture%!&(MISSING)source=gbs\_book\_citations\_r&cad=3\_1#PPP1,M1) [had](http://books.google.com/books?id=S-1ufki50DAC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1), but my titles remain unclaimed.

Second, architectural styles aside, I think that bare concrete as a building material belongs in an aesthetic class by itself.  In West Africa, pretty much all the modern building are made of nothing but concrete, but folks there have the good taste to paint it colors that, with enough natural light, appear bright and cheerful.  Come on Californians, paint those things!

I kind of like concrete architecture, if the concrete is used only as a shell and other, natural — especially rich wood — materials, are employed for the guts.  It also helps if floor-to-ceiling windows and vast, open interior spaces typify such structures, which concrete construction allows relatively easily.  Too much stainless steel, though, makes the whole thing feel like some jerk’s snarky vision of “the future”.

One of the striking differences, from my tourist point of view, between the bits of the former East Germany and some of the former communist countries to its immediate east + the Baltics is that the former had generally painted the big communist-style housing blocks while that latter generally hadn’t.

JPool, I don’t know the story about the aesthetics of concrete. Seemingly, people were very optimistic about its capacity for wear — I don’t know on what grounds.

The great exception, of course, is the Pantheon, but it’s only on the inside that you can really tell it was made of concrete.

_Come on Californians, paint those things!_

Berkeley took this advice for Evans Hall (where I worked and studied for five years), and it worked great, on the outside anyway.  From “Fort Evans” it’s changed into a genuinely presentable building, not unworthy of the new grand “quad”.

The Death Star is so much more than just where the Histry Department is, it houses all of the Social Sciences and Humanities at UCD, which means so many more students are subjected to dealing with it on a regular basis.  I believe the actual Death Star looks somewhat softer since there are some curves to it, whereas the UCD version is all corners and edges.

Architectural legend states that the UC Regents wanted a big-name hoo-ha to design the building as a cornerstone of the campus, but because they spent so much money on the architect they had to cut out some of the design elements that would have made the complex make more sense.  So, there were supposed to be waterfalls, pools and more landscaping to soften the expansive concrete.  

It seems as though many of the UC campuses are afflicted with ugly ultra-trendy-style-of-the-decade buildings (esp. true at the various Lawrence Labs).  Also, the Death Star does not seem to be aging well, and it doesn’t even have that much age to contend with.

I think the Beinecke is a great building, but it’s also not concrete–the panels are made of thin marble or travertine, which lets the light through.

The Perry-Castaneda Library at UT-Austin gives the Reg a run for its Brutalist money, with the added benefit of recessed window ledges that are perfect nesting places for pigeons, and thus perfect collection points for massive piles of pigeon shit. They’ve put wire spikes on the ledges to try to keep the birds off, which adds to the fortress effect. But, on the other hand, it is also shaped like the state of Texas, which seems more whimsical that brutalist. Brutsical?

_Incidentally I’m not actually sure the building pictured in the post counts as Brutalist. Modern, yes, but I think of Wurster or Boston City Hall as being much more representative of the Brutalist style._

The architect who designed UCI, [William Pereira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_Pereira), called it “California brutalism.”  The “brut” in “brutalism” just means concrete, though, so anything that’s composed of poured concrete can be called “brutalist.”
