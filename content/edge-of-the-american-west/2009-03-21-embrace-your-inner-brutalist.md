## Embrace your inner brutalist.

Brutalism may be “underloved,” as Christopher Shea [recently described it](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2009/03/brutalism\_lives.html), but you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone at UC Irvine who would argue against the notion that brutalist buildings come “across as oppressive and dreary.”  How oppressive are they?  Remember my [earlier post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/where-i-am-i-dont-know-ill-never-know-in-the-silence-you-dont-know-you-must-go-on-i-cant-go-on.html) about where the grade inflation study was performed?  You know what else happened there?

I am, as the kids say, _seriously_:

So if you don’t know why brutalism feels oppressive, ask an ape.  Why do I point this out?  To prove that my campus runs brutal circles around Ari and Eric’s.  How much more brutal is it?  Here’s a picture of [the statue they erected in my backyard last week](http://www.ocregister.com/photos/orc-alert-foot-2318309-orc-on-wolf-spotted-in-irvine/pid2318490):

I imagine they sat down and said:

“You know, Irvine’s already pretty darn brutal, but it’s not brutal _enough_.  What can we do?  Jenkins!”

“Statue of a pony, sir?”

“Ridiculous.  Ponies aren’t brutal.  Smith!”

“What about an orc, sir?”

“An orc?  I don’t know what that is, Smith, but it sounds Anglo-Saxon.  I think I like it!”

“What if we stuck an orc on a pony, sir?”

“What is it with you and ponies, Jenkins?”

“If I can interject, sir, Jenkins might have a point.  What if we mount the orc on a Volvo-sized wolf?  Wouldn’t that be pretty darn brutal?”

“Could we show it eating Jenkin’s pony?”

“I don’t see why not.”

That’s some hardcore brutality.
