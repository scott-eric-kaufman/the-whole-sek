*Published December 25, 2008*

Harold Pinter — [Undeserving Laureate of a Prize that Doesn’t Matter Anymore Because Who Still Reads Literature Anyway?](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/so_now_you_care.html) — died yesterday after a long struggle with esophageal cancer.  He will be missed.  *[Edited to remove an insensitive and unintentional pun.]*
