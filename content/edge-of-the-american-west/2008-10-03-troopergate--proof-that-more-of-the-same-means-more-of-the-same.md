## “Troopergate”: proof that “more of the same” means more of the same

[_Update: Oops.  Looks like I shouldn’t have trusted Johnson after all.  This isn’t Michalski’s decision—it’s the Defendants’ brief, written by Peter Maassan, for whose clients Michalski ruled.  That means this is second-class, legally-mandated snark instead of first-rate, smack-down snark._] __ 

I’m probably [the](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/on-kc-johnsons-.html) [last](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/more-on-kc-john.html) [person](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/my-final-statem.html) you’d expect to agree with KC Johnson—the final post in the aforelinked series is titled “[Absolutely, Positively the Last Words I’ll Write about KC Johnson or _Durham in Wonderland_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/absolutely-posi.html)”—so when I link to [his post](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/55229.html) on yesterday’s Michalski ruling, know that I do so reluctantly.  At issue is the so-called “Troopergate” filing, in which six Alaskan senators sought to quash the legislature’s investigation into possible abuses of power by Governor Sarah Palin.  Here’s Michalski’s summary of the events to date.  The Plantiffs’ argue

that the court must immediately enjoin the legislative investigation because “[a]s the nation watches, Senator French [D], Senator Elton [D] and Mr. Branchflower [are making] the Alaska Legislature and the State of Alaska a laughingstock.”

On this point, and this point alone, Michalski agrees:

In this politically charged atmosphere, perceptions differ.  Consider: Alaska’s Governor pledges her full cooperation with the investigation, then reverses court when selected for national office.  The Governor files an ethics complaint against herself, then moves to dismiss it as meritless.  The announcement that a witness will disobey an Alaska legislative subpoena comes from a spokesman of the McCain Campaign.  Six Alaska legislators file suit, asking the court to rule that the Legislature—their own coequal branch—has no authority to investigate abuses of power by the Executive.  The Attorney General, the highest law enforcement officer in the state, advises witness that whether to comply with subpoenas is a matter of personal choice.

Plaintiffs may truly believe that Alaska has become a “laughingstock,” but they should look at someone other than Defendants here for the source of the humor.


Michalski then addresses the case-law behind the Plaintiffs’ argument:

Plaintiffs give relatively short shrift to the legal bases for the relief they ask for, and with good reason.  In support of their extraordinary request—that the court shut down a duly authorized legislative investigation in the final weeks of its life, solely to forestall a possibly negative impact on the fortunes of one political party, Plaintiffs are able to cite . . .

Read [the decision itself](http://media.adn.com/smedia/2008/10/02/10/trooper.source.prod\_affiliate.7.pdf) for the legal niceties.  I’ll focus on the rhetorical effect:

. . . Plaintiffs are able to cite:

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .

Michalski’s conclusion?

Alaska law is unambiguous on these issues, and Plaintiffs failure to cite it, while lamentable, is understandable as well . . . .

[Plaintiffs’] obviously half-hearted argument cites no case law and relies on no legal principles . . . .

Again, if there were a single case in America that supports any of these highly dubious propositions, Plaintiffs would presumably have brought it to the court’s attention . . . .

Rarely, if ever, has a request for such extraordinary injunctive relief been made on such flimsy legal grounds.

It’s difficult to tell whether Michalski believes the legislators are ignorant of the law or merely partisan hacks.  At times, he seems to believe the former and sounds like a high school Civics teacher: “In the tripartite form of government shared to some degree by every one of the U.S. states,” &c.  This condescension could be a rhetorical ploy on his part, but Michalski sometimes seems convinced that the legislators have a Palin-esque understanding of the separation of powers, as when they

confuse two very different concepts: the actual _exercise_ of executive power (which of course is for the Executive), and the power to _investigate_ the Executive’s exercise of executive power (which is a fundamental power—and duty—of the Legislature . . . . Since all executive powers are given by law to the Executive, and since every action by the Executive is presumably taken pursuant to its executive powers, the Alaska Legislature—according to Plaintiffs—is forbidden from investigating _any executive action at all_.  For six sitting legislators to come into court and seek thus to eliminate one of the Legislature’s most fundamental and historically important powers—and all, apparently, for the prospect of short-term political gain in one national election—is stunningly short-sighted.

What we have here, then, is an example of legislators willing to cede powers inherent to it at the behest of an executive branch which believes all powers—every last one of them—are proper to the office of the Executive.  Now, I don’t know about you, but isn’t it ironic that conservatives are complaining that Palin isn’t Bush, and that Biden’s repeated attempts to smear her by association are unwarranted _the day after Michalski’s decision appears_?

Powers, schmowers.  It’s Alaska.  Aren’t they just making it up as they go along?

And the notion of basing law from embarrassment is kind of original.

Um, not to be a buzzkill or anything, but that’s not Michalski’s decision you’re quoting.  That’s the brief in opposition that was filed by the Defendants.

Dude, what year is it?  It’s 2008.  I don’t mean that in the sense that it’s an election year, but that it’s year + 8 of Bush.  What does that have to do with anything?  Let me offer a small chart.  Let’s say that a conservative like KC Johnson who is known for any or all of deception, shading the truth, ideological fixation or outright lying writes a defense of normal Americana — it doesn’t matter what.  That the executive is not a dictator, say.  What should your response be?

Year + 1:  Wow!  This person is an intellectually honest, respectable conservative!  Let’s link this everywhere!  

Year + 2: It’s so refreshing to hear a conservative saying these things.  I thought that everyone had forgot.  

Year + 3: Well, even a few honest conservatives are seeing the truth, now, about what’s going on.  

Year + 4: Finally!  It’s taken a long time, but ordinary conservatives are starting to get this.  

Year + 5: All right, things are getting so bad that even the lamest cons are getting it now.  

Year + 6: Now they’re saying this?  After flacking for so long?  Well, I suppose that rats get to leave a sinking ship.  

Year + 7: Any sane person has to say this now.  They get absolutely no credit for waiting till the last minute.  

Year + 8: Damned phonies.  The Bush era is going down, so they’re trying to save their credibility.  Screw them.

This is year + 8.  Just link to the Michalski decision directly.  (Or the brief in opposition, if that’s what it is.)

I think [this](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/troopergate-decision/) is the decision. ([via](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/gop\_suit\_to\_halt\_troopergate\_s.php))

Well, there’s one way to prove Rich right: I’ve updated my post, we’ll see if/when Johnson updates his.  This really does turn its teeth into dentures, inasmuch as counsel is _supposed_ to make their opponent’s case sound absurd, but given that Michalski ruled in the Defendants’ favor, I’m thinking they might’ve done the job honorably and honestly.

_writes a defense of normal Americana — it doesn’t matter what. That the executive is not a dictator, say._ 

Is that normal Americana anymore, Rich?  Seems like ages since it has been.  Not that you’re wrong, but in the spirit of McCain-sympathizers who rationalize Palin’s inability to hammer Biden last night as a deliberate strategy to save Issues X, Y, and Z for the debate closest to the election—had nothing to do with what was/wasn’t on her note cards—I’m going to claim that I meant to further discredit Johnson all along, and put his, um, you know, do this by, I don’t have a card on this, crap—_WINK_!

He hasn’t updated yet.  Busy guy, undoubtedly.

People don’t take it seriously when I rant about this kind of thing, but they should.  Really, seriously, no one should trust anyone who is still a conservative pundit / blogger / whatever at this point — not trust them unless you’ve checked every single aspect of what they’ve written, and if you’re going to do that, why not just get another source?  Truth really doesn’t mean much to them; it can’t, given how they’ve acted.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

Josh, Krauthammer is supporting Obama at this point.  So what?  You can have supported Obama since he started to run for President and still be a conservative: completely untrustworthy.

I’ll try putting this another way, though Emerson did it pithier.  The universe of sane opinions and the universe of conservative discourse intersect less and less.  Someone who is committed to getting people to listen to them beyond the conservative base pretty much has to adopt at least one or two sane positions.  But they don’t mean anything.  KC Johnson and his sycophants love to say that he supports Obama.  But so what?  That declaration does a few things, but mostly what it does is defend him against the charges of racism and conservative flacking that would otherwise naturally adhere to him from his Durham project.  And it’s not like Obama needs him in particular.  It’s self-interested, and it leaves the core areas that he likes to misrepresent intact — like a global warming denialist who likes to make a big thing out of how he’s a member of Amnesty International.

There’s a set of obvious moral ideas that should be accepted by everyone, now, that undergrads in history classes get no credit for earnestly asserting as if they lived back then, right?  Like, you get no credit for saying that slavery is bad.  There is a similar list for conservatives:

\* no credit for saying that torture is wrong  

\* no credit for saying that the executive isn’t a dictator  

\* no credit for saying that anthropogenic global warming exists

And so on.

KC has corrected his post at _Cliopatria_. The real question, of course, is why do KC-haters like Scott and Rich still give the Group of 88 a pass for refusing to admit that there was no rape in the Duke lacrosse case — despite the DNA evidence and legal findings to that effect. Both KC and Scott have corrected themselves when they know they’ve been incorrect. The Group doesn’t.

**[Jonathan Dresner](http://froginawell.net)**

					

		

I’m not sure why KC Johnson’s been tagged “conservative” in this: his opposition to leftist _scholarly_ positions has always been paired with a fairly traditional liberal-to-moderate democrat political analysis. I’ve not seen any significant evidence suggesting that Johnson’s a social conservative, or a political conservative, only that he’s methodologically conservative. I do think that his position parallels and aids the rightist critique of the academy, but that alliance, such as it is, is clearly not _intentional_, as he remains fairly reliably opposed to rightist agendas in every other area I’m aware of.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

He willfully misinterpreted the Group of 88’s position in order to make them conform to a rightist critique of the academy, and to keep on demanding that they admit something that they never asserted.  His involvement with the Duke case went far beyond seeing justice done, far past the point at which justice actually was done, towards stirring up a brew of racial resentment, which he continues to encourage.

As for whether it’s _intentional_ — he’s pitched his case, and himself, in every right-wing media outlet he could reach.  Who would have heard of him otherwise?  The right wing loves a guy who can say that’s he a moderate democrat, but hey, he agrees with them about everything — except Obama.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

BS, Ralph.  I went over the Group of 88’s statement in detail, pointing out exactly where KC Johnson had misinterpreted it.  It’s all there in the thread that Scott linked to, and I don’t need to repeat it here.  The rest of my characterization — for instance, that he continues to pursue the case long after the students were found innocent and the prosecutor censured, or that he did many pieces for right-wing media, or that his commenters regularly express racial resentment — involves matters of fact that are either documented or unchallenged.

You’re the one, Ralph, who is covering for him.  Shame on you.

_I wouldn’t trust him on anything, including his historical scholarship._

Jacob, I’ve mostly taken the words of others on this front—Ralph foremost among them—and given that he does legislative history I’d assumed his work here would be better than, say, that of someone who’s a Doctor of Philosophy of English could muster.  

_The real question, of course, is why do KC-haters like Scott and Rich still give the Group of 88 a pass for refusing to admit that there was no rape in the Duke lacrosse case_

Ralph, I don’t know why you’re _still_ on this, all these years later—and in a post where I was burned for giving KC the benefit of the doubt, no less.  Besides, in _the very first post_ I noted:

_He divined the truth of what happened in Durham on the night of March 13th long before the police announced the results of their investigation.  He was correct.  Those who believed three Duke lacrosse players had raped an African-American women were incorrect._

I’m still not responsible for what the infamous Group of 88 did, but in KC’s eyes, I’ll always be guilty of thinking drunk frat boys who hire strippers might rape someone—even if that that someone is a stripper with a history of drug abuse.  You know why I thought that then—and why I still continue to think it now?  Because _I’ve known many drunk frat boys who hire strippers_, and I’ve been to many a party they’ve thrown—oftentimes unwittingly, by virtue of being in a different establishment on frat row when one of their parties spilled over, often with violence—but we’ve gone over this before.  I understand why the players weren’t initially given the benefit of the doubt, KC never could.  Maybe this is my failing—but that’s neither here nor there.

What is relevant is that KC wore ideological blinders, wrote intellectually dishonest summaries about disciplines he knew nothing about—your disagreement with Timothy about the value of cultural studies comes to mind—and behaved in a way not unlike Maassan criticizes the Plaintiffs for behaving.  Those six legislators were willing to gut their traditional powers, vested in them by both the Alaskan and federal constitutions, in order to score a cheap political victory; KC merely did it for attention and profit.

_Ah yes, the Duke rape case. Truly the most important issue facing the Republic today._

But Walt!  It’s all about affirmative action, which is the only reason an empty suit like Obama’s even the nominee!  Don’t you read Malkin?

**[Ralph Luker](http:hnn.us/blogs/2.html)**

					

		

Scott, Why my disagreement with Tim about the value of culture studies “comes to mind”, when I didn’t write KC’s summaries about them, escapes me. I do not find them useful in my own work and I suspect that KC doesn’t find them useful in doing his, which is a rather traditional political history. It would be more constructive if you’d abandon the attempt to drive wedges between historians who manage to tolerate multiple methodologies and perspectives. It ill-becomes you.

Whether it’s Rich or Scott or KC or me, we can be held responsible for what we say. They cannot. It seems to me, then, that anonymous or pseudonymous bloggers or commenters have a particular obligation of \*self\* restraint that this commenter didn’t observe.

In America in 2008 I read  

That people should be responsible for what they said  

Yes, I thought, that’s a good thing indeed  

That those who called for war should have that be the seed  

Of contempt, now and future, for all that they’ve been  

Even more for those who said “torture to win”  

With some left to spare for those who would not stop  

Talking up the free market as bubbles went pop  

Global warming denialists, their names should be cursed  

But maybe the racists are among the worst  

I even question the judgement of those who would say  

That civility, among horrors, should carry the day  

But to lecture a student whose name won’t show up  

I can’t write any more cause I have to throw up
