## Enemies made or enemies born?

On this day in history, two men—one of whom would say that the other’s life work represented “the utmost human degradation[:] an idiot’s vegetative existence”—were born.  In 1885, the author of that statement, Marxist literary critic Georg Lukács, dewombed in Budapest.  Often cited as the founder of Western (or philosophical) Marxism, Lukács can be considered the grandfather of the armchair academic activists who fought the radical fight from tenured positions at illustrious institutions.  I only half-kid here: his claim in _The Historical Novel_ (1937) that the role of the literary critic was to examine “the relation between ideology (in the sense of _Weltanschauung_) and artistic creation” ([147](http://books.google.com/books?id=-\_DoAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=)) allowed otherwise sedentary scholars to label as revolutionary action an exegesis on Dickensian realism.  Anyone whose work analyzed critical or socialist realism, _i.e._ literature which displayed “the contradictions within society and within the individual context of a dialectical unity,” could consider him or herself a soldier in the Great Class War Against Mystification.  Like [Susan Sontag](http://books.google.com/books?id=e3qgRrVlEH4C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=#PPA88,M1), I find his definition of realism—socialist, critical or otherwise—unnecessarily reductive and his dismissiveness of non-realist works short-sighted (if not out-right anti-intellectual).

In 1906, the same year Lukács received his Ph.D., was born the man whose work depicted “an idiot’s vegetative existence.”  That Samuel Beckett’s novels, plays and poetry trafficked in “human degradation” was reason enough for condemnation: unlike realists novels, which were capable of creating dialectical conversations between singular narratives and the social totality of history, modernist novels wallowed in the singularity of their narrators:

Lack of objectivity in the description of the outer world finds its complement in the reduction of reality to a nightmare.  Beckett’s _Molloy_ is perhaps the _ne plus ultra_ of this development. ([152](http://books.google.com/books?id=UrCln8TYJMEC&pg=PA152&dq=))

If an author grounds that nightmare in “the Aristotelian concept of man as _zoon politikon_” ([151](http://books.google.com/books?id=UrCln8TYJMEC&pg=PA151)); that is, if an author provides a reference against which the consequences of the actions of social animals can be judged: only then can reader or critic differentiate between the concrete potentialities (what happens) and the abstract potentialities (what the character thought could have happened).  Authors who refuse to declare what happened—who mess in the pseudo-realization of abstract potentiality—create readers who will never know from dialectical.  They will not be social animals critically examining the societal structuring of their lives through the power of realist narratives; they will be unwitting dupes forever mired in the pathological subjectivity of Molloy, [forever sucking pebbles](http://books.google.com/books?id=sglVtT7\_nH4C&pg=PP1&dq=molloy&ei=f9bjScibOIGUkASSucWcDQ&client=firefox-a#PPA93,M1).  Their lives, such that they are, will be spent in the Grand Hotel Abyss, which Lukács describes as

a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered. (qtd. [22](http://books.google.com/books?id=Qa75D2dtiz0C&pg=PA22))

Needless to say, I disagree.

I’ll close on an historical odditiy: not only was Lukács born on April 13th, so too was the French psychoanalyst and psychoanalytic theorist, Jacques Lacan.  It’s as if the day conspired to give birth to the thought of Louis Althusser (which, as you can probably guess, is one part Lukácian, one part Lacanian and three cans of crazy).

Certainly, but the point of “This Day in History” posts (as I take it) is more introductory than polemic.  I mean, I could’ve really thrashed him—his argument has merit, and as an historicist, I’m certainly sympathetic to the non-Jamesonian versions of it—but I thought it’d be more appropriate to rehash his legacy.  (Plus, [unlike Heilein](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/i-wish-that-son-of-a-gun-would-take-that-other-hand-out-of-his-pocket/), I don’t actually despise Lukacs.  I just think he’s wrong.)

Maybe not so much wrong as that it’s amazing what a small room some folks want to live in, and he built it all by himself.

OK, but then let’s record that on realism, Brecht pwned Lukács in 1938.   GL’s 1962 swipe at Adorno was made from a position of moral, political, and intellectual weakness.

And what the beginning reader would not learn from your opening-para potshot at “sedentary scholars” is that Lukács in \_History and Class Consciousness\_ articulated one of the most famous and influential arguments \*against\* intellectuals’ relevance to politics, contrasting their bourgeois detachment with the direct, lived experience of the proletariat.  It was a crap argument, but it’s weird to see you assign him the opposite crap argument.

_“Dewombed”?_

That’s a drafty artifact I have to leave in now that you’ve mentioned it.  I’d originally included this in there:

(May 5th would’ve been the official holiday of the Perpetually Coming Freudo-Marxist Regime had Freud not wanted to quit the womb so quickly.)

And never edited the “dewombed” out.  And now I can’t!

_Brecht pwned Lukács in 1938. GL’s 1962 swipe at Adorno was made from a position of moral, political, and intellectual weakness._

I wouldn’t go that far.  My sympathies vis-a-vis modernism are with Adorno, but Lukács held his own for far longer than he ought have been able to, which testifies to . . . something or other.  

Honestly, I’m conflicted on Lukács because his form of advocacy criticism is one I like: none of this “I will shove this down your gullet _and you will like it_!” crap.  He has faith that the literariness of the literary text has social utility.  I don’t necessarily buy that argument—I’ve seen the photos of the SS reading Goethe, and am, besides, a human being—but it’s one I want to buy, because it means that if I teach my students to read complex material with a critical eye, they’ll adopt my politics.  Because I can’t in good faith impress my ideology upon them, you know, plus the idea of natural outgrowth’s seductive.

_And what the beginning reader would not learn from your opening-para potshot at “sedentary scholars” is that Lukács in \_History and Class Consciousness\_ articulated one of the most famous and influential arguments \*against\* intellectuals’ relevance to politics, contrasting their bourgeois detachment with the direct, lived experience of the proletariat. It was a crap argument, but it’s weird to see you assign him the opposite crap argument._

I’m not actually assigning him that argument.  When I say “grandfather,” I mean he’s no more responsible for what his disciples do than Pa is when the kids go cow-tipping . . . which means that both provided them with a framework which later generations used as they pleased.  But the line from Lukács to Jameson’s fairly well spoken for, so I’m not sure why you think I’m the one doing the misleading here.  The connection’s not necessary, I agree, but that is how his work was used by the next couple generations of scholars.  (Also, the forcefulness of rhetoric is something they adopted as well.  The Siren’s song of dialectical rectitude being too sweet to resist and all.)

_Never have i felt more ambiguous about my Hungarian heritage._

No need!  All I’m saying is, I love that he believes that a critical eye turned onto a realist text necessarily reveals the true nature of the dialectic and makes every sympathetic soul a leftist.  Courage of convictions and all.  But as Colin said, Lukács had his ass handed to him on account of his not having a robust enough imagination or, ironically, enough faith in the readers he otherwise believed to be so malleable.  For example, according to Lukács, the reader who’d spot the discrepancy between what [Little Dorrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little\_Dorrit) and the castles her father built in the air would, according to Lukács, be dumbfounded by difference between what Molly Bloom soliloquized in “Penelope” and _everything else that happened in the novel_.  I don’t buy that, no matter how many cows someone tips . . .

Sure, but the horse you’re flogging is _late_ Lukacs. The _early_ Lukacs was another kettle of horse altogether. Back before he became a Marxist, Lukacs was not bad at all. _The Theory of the Novel_, from whence comes the preface quoted above, is almost, but not quite, completely sane. It’s not revolutionary\*, but it’s interesting. 

\* Yes, intended. Sorry.

My favorite revolting Lukacs story is from when he was briefly the deputy commissar of culture and public education under Kun. As I recall, he initiated an ambitious program to give workers time off to go to the theater. They didn’t go, so he arranged to have workers payed a stipend to go to the theater. They didn’t go, so he ordered them to go to the theater.

I was just being silly, sort of.  Truth is, I’ve always been this ambiguous about my Hungarian heritage.  Have you seen the jellied pig’s feet?!?

On the other hand, I firmly stand behind ordering people to go to the theater!

_Back before he became a Marxist, Lukacs was not bad at all. The Theory of the Novel, from whence comes the preface quoted above, is almost, but not quite, completely sane._

But that preface is from the [1962 edition](http://books.google.com/books?id=Qa75D2dtiz0C&pg=PA23), Martin.  So it’s all crazed late Lukacs.  That said, I sorta kinda agree with you about early vs. late Lukacs, but for a different reason: his early championing of realist works matches up with his late championing of realists works because they’ll create a demystified citizenry . . . but I’ve always thought that the aesthetic dislike evident in the early work manifested as an ideological objection in the later work.  I can spin this out more thoroughly: I have a seminar paper where I map all this out and which I can just post, exactly as I wrote it in 2003, with no amendations for style or audience or formatting, if you’d like, which I think’ll convince you, well, of something.  (Most likely how terrible a writer I once was.)  I’ve been meaning to revisit that material though, so if there’s genuine interest, I’m more than happy to adapt it for the Interwebs.

_My favorite revolting Lukacs story. . ._

You don’t have to choose just one!

Much as I appreciate the nuanced distinctions of the early pre-Marxist and Late Marxist Lukacs, I think there is an excess of nuance in all of this. There are only three things you need to know about Lukacs:

First, once he decided to join the CP he was a committed Stalinist tool. He bent himself morally and intellectually to whichever way the wind blew from Moscow. Simply put he threw away his genius to be a toady. (And so did Brecht, but Brecht had a swiss bank account, which made him a hypocrite to boot.)

Second, \_History and Class Consciousness\_ was Lukacs’s only serious contribution to Marxism and everything else he wrote was intellectual hackery in the service of the Party. I have no idea why people keep crediting him as a founding father of Western Marxism. Its Gramsci and the Frankfurt School! Lets hear it for Gramsci! 

Third, even though Lukacs was a crap intellectual, he was a good teacher. His students, especially Agnes Heller and Ferenc Feher were his real intellectual legacy. This was Lukacs’s sole redeeming quality. 

Finally, Jazzbumpa, if you liked the Jellied pigs feet try the pickled pigs tongue and be sure to wash it down with Vilmos Korte Palinka. I can’t recommend the stomach stew though. I couldn’t hack that one.

Not a fan huh?  Lukacs is one of my favorite writers, not to mention one of my favorite biographies, despite — or rather because of — his many flaws.  I suspect he’s less interesting for literary critics than he is for political theorists, especially those with a fondness for early 20th century intellectual history and Marxism.

By the way, the major biography (by Kadarsky) and “The Young Lukacs” both portray a secular Hungarian Jew whose intellectual language was mainly German (discounting a series of theater reviews).  I think his his first book — soul and form — was written in German, and [dealt with German authors](http://books.google.com/books?id=\_JU5AAAACAAJ&dq=soul+and+form).  Not to mention the not-insignificant experience he had studying with Max Weber before the Great War.  So, in the end, Lukacs’ heritage may have been Hungarian, but he is a product of the fluid linguistic and intellectual climate of pre-1914 Europe.
