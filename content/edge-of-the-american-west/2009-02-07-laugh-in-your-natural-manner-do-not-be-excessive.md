All the [crying](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=14222) [and](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2009/01/were-there-a-mens-cologne.html) [crowing](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/02/pajamas\_media\_r.php) over the death of Pajamas Media overshadowed the birth of the awesomeness that is Pajamas Television.  Just today I watched Glenn Reynolds, Michelle Malkin, and the Artisan Formerly Known as Joe the Plumber [discuss](http://www.pjtv.com/?cmd=video&media-id=4522&video-id=1320&video-title=Conservatism\_20%!A(MISSING)\_Joe%!C(MISSING)\_Obama\_Appointments\_and\_Stimulus\_Fund&series-name=PJTV\_Daily\_) the first weeks of the Obama administration.  They showed behind-the-scenes footage of the Daschle debacle:

They laughed _ha ha_ while the tape ran.  Then Reynolds showed it again _ha ha_.  Malkin said it was distracting _ha ha_.  Reynolds asked how that got in there again _ha ha_.  Is that the Obama administration or a car full of clowns _ha ha._ Who can tell _ha ha._ 

Because being on the cutting edge of political commentary entails airing footage of a clown car while the contemporary equivalent of “[Bag of Rags](http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mistcla2/McKanlass.htm)” blares.  I couldn’t watch much more than the first five minutes—I kept waiting for Reynolds to pull a [full Saget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%!s(MISSING)\_Funniest\_Home\_Videos) and show Obama getting beaned in the privates by a baseball.  But I saw enough to capture the new face of serious journalism in all its seriousness:

Pajamas Television: where you can watch a middle-aged man put every ounce of the fiber of his being into nailing a lick on his air guitar.  Serious journalism for serious people _ha ha_.

I believe the only proper response to PJTV is [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytCEuuW2\_A).

“every ounce of the fiber of his being”

interesting. in the version of this idiom i’ve heard–“every fibre of his being”–the word “fibre” is a count-noun.

here it seems to be a mass-noun (or, digestively speaking, a bulk-noun).

I was less concerned with count nouns than seeming suitably overwrought.  I’d originally written “110 percent of every ounce of the fiber of his being,” but that seemed a little too much.
