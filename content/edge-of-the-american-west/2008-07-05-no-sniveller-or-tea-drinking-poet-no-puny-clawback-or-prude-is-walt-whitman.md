## No sniveller, or tea-drinking poet, no puny clawback or prude, is Walt Whitman!

On 5 July 1855, the day after the publication of _Leaves of Grass_, literary critics began thinking about how best to imitate Whitman.  Few are the authors who inspire the flattery of imitation more than he!  Few are the critics who are able to resist the urge to flatter any else but he!  Few are the sentences in which I’ll continue to enact the enthused imitations I mock!

Think I’m making this up?  The following might be far less successful than [zunguzungu](http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/)‘s [found Williams](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/03/such-an-awful-universe-of-battle/#comment-13877), but the poemified version of the anonymous review of _Leaves of Grass_ from the September 1855 edition of _The United States Review_ certainly is telling.

In a way, this is an extreme version of a [common critical vice](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/derridalogy-a-remark/#comments): read too much of this or that to the exclusion of all else and you’ll start to inhabit the voice you purport to study.  The linked example may be Derrida, but read a few books on Joyce and Faulkner and you’ll see the same unhealthy attitude abounds.  But I digress.

On to the ersatz American heart of the body poetic!


**Walt Whitman and His Poems**

An American bard at last!  

One of the roughs, large, proud, affectionate, eating, drinking, and breeding,  

His costume manly and free,  

His face sunburnt and bearded,  

His postures strong and erect,  

His voice bringing hope and prophecy to the generous races of young and old.  

We shall cease shamming and be what we really are.  

We shall start an athletic and defiant literature.  

We realize now how it is and what was most lacking.  

The interior American republic shall also be declared free and independent.

For all our intellectual people,  

Followed by their books, poems, essays, editorials, lectures, tuitions, and criticisms,  

Dress by London and Paris modes, receive what is received there,  

Obey the authorities,  

Settle disputes by the old tests,  

Keep out of rain and sun,  

Retreat to the shelter of houses and schools,  

Trim their hair, shave, touch not the earth barefoot,  

And enter not the sea except in a complete bathing dress.  

One sees unmistakably genteel persons,  

Traveled, college-learned, used to being served by servants,  

Conversing without heat or vulgarity,  

Supported on chairs or walking through handsomely-carpeted parlors,  

Or along shelves bearing well-bound volumes.

Where in American literature is the first show of America?  

Where are the gristle and beards, and broad breasts, and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the souls of the people love?  

Where is the majesty of the federal mother, seated with more than antique grace, calm, just, indulgent to her brood of children, calling them around her, regarding the large and the young and the older with perfect impartiality?  

Where is the vehement growth of our cities?  

Where is the spirit of the strong rich life of the American mechanic, farmer, sailor, hunter, and miner?  

Where is the huge composite of all other nations, cast in a fresher and brawnier matrix, passing adolescence, and needed this day, live and arrogant, to lead the marches of the world?

Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature!  

Talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such as being as a writer,  

Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior.  

Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of old theories and forms.  

Every phrase announces new laws—not once do his lips unclose except in conformity to them.  

He makes audacious and native uses of his own body and soul.  

He recreates poetry with the elements at hand.  

He imbues it with himself as he is,  

Disorderly, fleshy, and sensual,  

Lover of things,  

Yet lover of men and women above the whole of other objects in the universe.

His work is to be achieved by unusual methods!

Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk of rhyme and poetry,  

Not the first recognition of gods or goddesses or Greece or Rome.  

No breath of Europe,  

Or her monarchies,  

Or her priestly conventions,  

Or her gentlemen and ladies,  

Or her idea of caste,  

Seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs.  

In their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age and the realities of this mighty continent and the sciences and inventions discoveries of this present world.  

Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor physiology, nor engineering,  

Is more true to itself  

Than Whitman is to them.

Scott’s post reminds me that there are few teaching pleasures equal to imitating Whitman’s bombast to a room full of undergrads.

Whether you agree or not, I was just directed to this nifty site on Whitman’s Brooklyn, with lots of high-res engravings:

Um, the author of this text is [Walt Whitman himself](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/whitman-leavesofgrass.html#ww0018).  So it’s not surprising that it should read like his poetry, or praise him in his own terms.

Walt Whitman. One of those names. Like Wilford Woodruff. Leaves of Grass could as easily have been written by a Whit Waltman, and polygamy could have as easily been proclaimed no longer a Mormon practice by Woodford Wildruff.

Gotta be care to keep the two e’s in e.e. cummings’ name in proper order.

I hate you, Vance.

My joke, it is ruined, so ignore this post.  

I must still respect Vance for the sound advice he offered _vis-a-vis_ my chapters, but I will hate him forever for ruining this joke.

SEK– I’m not sure Vance ruined the joke. Its one thing when  [Phil Rizzuto] (http://brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book\_id/122/) doesn’t know his own poetic license, but quite another when Whitman might, or might not.

Michael Elliot, my wife was watching [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXPD/diesekoschmar-20) today while working on her prospectus — I can’t work with noise, she can’t work without it — so you’ll have to excuse me if I can’t take you seriously today … but [_Whitman’s Brooklyn_](http://www.whitmansbrooklyn.org/) is pure awesome.  

As soon as I recover from Vance being crazy knowledgeable about all things which are stuff I bite my tongue mouthing, I’ll do a follow up on what I didn’t think anyone would pick up on … namely, that Whitman’s anonymous reviews of _Leaves of Grass_ were _terrible parodies of himself_.  You’d think he could muster talent enough to imitate himself, but no, his reviews of _Leaves of Grass_ were pale shades of what was in the book itself.

Sorry, I was too dense to play along properly.  This form of joke, depending on rigorous collective censorship of something obvious, is difficult enough to sustain in person, let alone on the Internet, where the population of potential blunderers is unbounded.  It was at the phrase “one of the roughs” that I thought, wait a minute….

My favorite parody of Whitman (by someone else than Whitman, that is) is E. B. White’s “A classic waits for me.”  It was published in The New Yorker, 19 Feb 1944.  It ends:

By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterparts of  

  on the same terms (89¢ for the Regular Edition or $1.39 for the De Luxe  

  Edition plus a few cents postage).  

I will make inseparable readers with their arms around each others necks,  

  By the love of classics,  

    By the manly love of classics.

Scott, no need to take me seriously today or any other.  But the idea of composing a prospectus to “Billy Elliot” makes me wonder about which film I should have selected for mine.  “The Big Sleep”?

_Scott, no need to take me seriously today or any other. But the idea of composing a prospectus to “Billy Elliot” makes me wonder about which film I should have selected for mine. “The Big Sleep”?_

From what Ari tells me, that’s not quite right.  (Except inasmuch as all dissertations, by their very nature, induce it.)  Sorry if I came off flip yesterday, but my thoughts on teaching Whitman were being perforated by an admonition to DANCE BILLY DANCE, so I wasn’t able to muster much of a response.  

Now that I think about it, I’m not sure how she thinks — much less writes — with all that noise, but I can’t help but wonder what her adviser thinks when, in the middle of an account of how you can tell from the slight curvature of the “p” that a left-handed monk from Germany began transcribing this copy of Ovid _Metamorphoses_ in a monastery in Alcazar de San Juan before moving on to one outside Le Loroux-Bottereau, she learns WE ARE SPARTA!

What I find weird on reconsidering this review is not that it fails as imitation of Whitman’s poetry, but that it fails as an imitation of J. Random Littérateur.  Whitman was a newspaperman, right?  So he must have known the sort of thing that passed for reviewing in his day.  Yet when the occasion calls for it, what he comes up with is an awkwardly constrained version of his own poetic mode.  It’s endearing, I suppose, that the Singer of Himself should fail when trying to sing literally for his supper….

Maybe singing about singing about himself was just too meta for him.

“My joke, it is ruined, so ignore this post.”

Ah! So it was a \*joke\*! And here I thought it was just mid/dis-information.

These challenging times. I cling to my copy of Derrida both for comfort and to guide me through these post-ironic times.

O! strained meaning of confused intellectuals! O! struggling noggins in the waterfront espresso bars! O! battered theses of tired young turks! O! (!\*SMACK\*!)… that hurts, my brother!
