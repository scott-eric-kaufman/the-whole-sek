Via [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=6617) (whose [realist\* riff on Batman](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=767) I taught last week):

If ever a photo called out for a caption, this one does.

**UPDATE:** It’s a little long for a caption, but I do believe [AWB](http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/) [] ()[allegorizes the moment to perfection](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/the-enduring-image-of-the-2008-presidential-campaign/#comment-23608):

The whole situation is emblematic of his campaign. He’s smug and overconfident sitting on his side of the desk, but Obama makes a move to the left and he unconsciously follows it, until he realizes it makes him look like a follower, at which point he does something hideous and shocking before heading as far to the right as possible.

\*By which I mean, I asked the students to discuss whether Ellis’s take was more or less realistic than the genre-driven cycle of incarceration Umberto Eco described [here](http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0300-7162(197221)2%!A(MISSING)1%!C(MISSING)14%!A(MISSING)TMOS%!E(MISSING)2.0.CO%!B(MISSING)2-5) [JSTOR].
