Via [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=6617) (whose [realist\* riff on Batman](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=767) I taught last week):

![last night's debate in pictures](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/lastnightsdebateinpictures.jpg?w=490)

If ever a photo called out for a caption, this one does.

**UPDATE:** It’s a little long for a caption, but I do believe [AWB](http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/) [] ()[allegorizes the moment to perfection](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/the-enduring-image-of-the-2008-presidential-campaign/#comment-23608):

The whole situation is emblematic of his campaign. He’s smug and overconfident sitting on his side of the desk, but Obama makes a move to the left and he unconsciously follows it, until he realizes it makes him look like a follower, at which point he does something hideous and shocking before heading as far to the right as possible.

\*By which I mean, I asked the students to discuss whether Ellis’s take was more or less realistic than the genre-driven cycle of incarceration Umberto Eco described [here](http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0300-7162(197221)2%!A(MISSING)1%!C(MISSING)14%!A(MISSING)TMOS%!E(MISSING)2.0.CO%!B(MISSING)2-5) [JSTOR].

This was the moment that he found himself following Barack around the desk and realized that made him look bad, so, changing directions, he tried to make a “humanizing” face of mild embarrassment. FAIL.

Apparently, the widely-noted “tongue jut” when he’s lying has evolved into [full-bore tongue-wagging](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/12790.html). 

Is he auditioning for some KISS cover band? Trying to supplant Albert Einstein as the “stick-your-tongue out” celebrity of the century?

And why would following Obama around the desk be a bad thing? You pick a direction and you _stick with it_, instead of dodging back and forth, ultimately failing to get anywhere, looking like a spaniel on a hot day.

No, that’s not ‘shopped. If you go to [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvdfO0lq4rQ), almost all the way to the end (about 1:29:50), you can see it quite clearly. It’s just a brief moment, but some photographer sitting there with burst mode on full-blast clearly caught it perfectly.

Sybil, you can’t see it from that angle, because the television cameras were trained on them from the front.  The image is from an AP photographer stage-left.

_I’m looking at this video but really can’t see it quite clearly._

It’s a very, very brief moment at (looking at it again) 1:29:58. It’s not very clear in the video, but it clearly authenticates the photo.

has anybody looked into drug-induced tardive dyskinesia?

one of the side-effects of some medications (e.g. anti-parkinson’s medications, antipsychotics) is a symptom called “flycatcher’s tongue”  or “flycatcher’s syndrome”. 

it involves this kind of involuntary tongue-thrusting.  also involves facial grimacing.

see e.g. here:  

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive\_dyskinesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive\_dyskinesia)

“Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements. Features of the disorder may include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing of the lips, and rapid eye blinking.”

**[Jason B](http://notnotnegative.blogspot.com/)**

					

		

From [kid’s link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive\_dyskinesia):

_Tardive dyskinesia is a variety of dyskinesia (involuntary, repetitive movements) manifesting as a side effect of long-term or high-dose use of dopamine antagonists, usually antipsychotics._

An antipsychotic would disqualify McCain as a Republican, would it not? Can’t be that, then.

Oh, wait. From [the same link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive\_dyskinesia):

_Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements._

Other than “involuntary,” that sounds like McCain’s runs at the presidency . . .

Maybe kid’s on to something. Or on something. Has anyone checked _him_ for tardible whatchamahoozit?

It looks fine on Mozilla.  The London Times excerpted the McCain side of the photo and has been running a caption contest all day.  Many responses including a reader’s suggestion that McCain was performing a Haka to intimidate Obama.

_howard dean._

I don’t think so.  Joe Trippi makes the argument in his book that Dean never really wanted to be President, just to change the party and the country.  He’s done that in magnificent fashion.  The only people who are bittersweet about this are his fanatical supporters, like me.

even if dean was not stuck on becoming president, he surely did not want to lose it by having one vocal glitch repeated in an endless loop on cable tv.

the media–maybe the public as well, maybe even me–get fixated on small, insignificant events that really tell us very little about how the candidate would govern. 

but they expose the candidate to ridicule, and no candidate can afford that. (dukakis in a tank).

bitter, because mccain’s tongue-thrust must remind dean of how unfairly he was done in by an ‘enduring image’.  sweet, because it’s about fucking time that a republican gets the same treatment.

of course, if the tongue-thrust is a side-effect of drug use (the ambien may be only the tip of the iceberg), then this gesture is not at all incidental and insignificant. 

if he’s doped up, he should not be president. but if it was just a one-off expression of surprise, the kind that any of us might make in an awkward moment, then i really feel that it’s a damned shame that it has the impact it does (while also feeling that it’s about time that it impacts an r).

and, yes, we do owe howard dean some thanks for his efforts behind the scenes for the last few years. he has done a lot to rebuild the party.

**[The Modesto Kid](http://www.readin.com/blog/blog.asp)**

					

		

Is the media getting fixated on this picture? I thought a couple of blogs were doing so, while the media’s big take-away from the debate was Joe “the Plumber” Wurzelbacher. I watched a couple of TV shows last night and saw nothing about the tongue-thrust. It is just such a funny picture — I could almost see voting for McCain on the basis of this picture. Not for POTUS of course, but maybe for some kind of ceremonial office where his duties involved greeting and welcoming visitors 
to the US
 to Wal-Mart.
