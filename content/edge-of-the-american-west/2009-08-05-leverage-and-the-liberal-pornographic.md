## Leverage and the Liberal Pornographic

Unlike their counterparts on [The Definite-Indefinite Article-Team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_A-Team), the Robin Hoods on John Rogers and Chris Downey’s [_Leverage_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001OQCVCY/diesekoschmar-20) aren’t joyful militarists whose idea of helping people invariably involves vans and walls. Because, unlike _Leverage_, that other show

was a guy’s show. It was male-driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It’s about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show.

In the 1980s, heroism only came from the barrel of guns aimed by incompetent men at similarly scattershot adversaries—because for all the gunplay, no one was ever shot. When these world-historically poor shots grew tired of wasting ammunition, they would chase each other in vans until one of them found a wall in need of [Kool-Aid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBeUGqeYsQg), then someone would punch someone, everyone would laugh, and the day would somehow have been saved.

The Definite-Indefinite Article-Team was a male fantasy about a world in which simpleminded evil could be thwarted by brute force, the implication being that had the government allowed these clowns—who, the audience was to believe, were once ex-Special Forces—free rein in Vietnam, America would have won the war. How you win a war with soldiers who can barely hit the broad side of a barn _with a van_ is beside the point: the 1980s needed manly men to manly deeds, and when they did, nothing made much sense, but everything worked out.

[_Insert here a clunky summary of the arching plot.  Describe how it’s a show in which a former insurance investigator hires the talented specialists he formerly investigated to help those that corporations have rendered helpless.  Maybe mention that the [official website](http://www.tnt.tv/series/leverage/display/?contentId=39809) describes it as a show that features “elaborate scams designed to exact revenge against those who use power and wealth to victimize people.”_ _Then move on because exposition is necessary, but good God damn, is it ever boring._] __ 

With _Leverage_, the issue isn’t whether nothing makes sense and everything works out, but whether the audience can make sense of how everything worked out. [According to John Rogers](http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2009/07/leverage-201-beantown-bailout-job-post.html):

Testing indicates—and I’m not kidding—that about 30%!o(MISSING)f our audience _never understands the con at all_.

Despite the fact that almost one-third of viewers have no clue what’s happening or why, Americans have voted with their eyes and elected _Leverage_ the most popular show on basic cable. Which means that Americans love something they don’t understand, fully aware that they’re not understanding it. Unlike _Twin Peaks_, where the ignorance was as collective as its ratings were impressive, _Leverage_ is a caper show, so the visceral narrative enjoyment should come from watching the plot hatch.

Let me literalize that:

Ideally, the audience should watch a hen have sex with a mutant rooster, then see the egg appear and, knowing what’s in the egg, watch with gleeful anticipation as the fox steals into the hen house and is confronted not with a delicious yellow chick, but a mutant-blue chick with the proportionate strength of an ant:

[![Relative superman](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a51ea994970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a51ea994970c-pi)

Only then should they treasure their anti-corporate catharsis.

Instead, almost one-third of _Leverage_‘s audience sees chickens having sex, is momentarily confused, but then marvels at the sudden appearance of an egg and squeals with glee when a just-born peep beats down the full-grown fox. For a caper show to be popular without being, for much of its audience, a caper show, means that its appeal is rooted in soils unwatered by _Ocean’s 11_ and ff.

So it is.

Rogers again:

Bernie Madoff stole FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. In a PONZI SCHEME. Which is the criminal equivalent of convincing people you are going to fly to the moon in a refrigerator box. The single, unpleasant truth is that most people, particularly criminals, are NOT complex. They are shallow, greedy sons of bitches to whom we attribute genius planning or complex motivations in order to preserve a false sense of order in our universe.

We desperately want to attribute otherwise. We want to believe that simpleminded evils are not, in fact, simpleminded, but that we’ve been duped by highly competent con artists whose methods are so arcane they can only be countered by other, more highly competent con artists. We enjoy the show _despite the con_ because we want to believe such cons can’t be understood and really just want some vicarious vengeance.

Reaction to the show, then, is primal and political: we want to see for-profit military opportunists suffer for their trespasses against our soldiers, because war is more complicated now than it was thirty years ago; we want to see contractors who prey on over-extended homeowners in the wake of natural disasters be punished, because disaster relief is now politicized; by which I mean, we want to see ordinary criminals so offended by the non-crimes immoral profiteers lawfully commit that a third of us will devote thirteen hours to a show we don’t understand just to watch a mutant chicken gore a cowering pro-corporate fox.

[_Tomorrow I’ll post a more in-depth analysis of “The Bank Shot Job.”  I was going to do it tonight, but I think there’s enough to chew on there already._]

I’ve always loved Rogers’ blog — and if you’ve never read Kung Fu Monkey, folks, do yourself a favor and go read [this](http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2004/12/i-miss-republicans.html) and [this](http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2005/10/lunch-discussions-145-crazification.html) right now — and checked the show out.  The first season was nice enough, but the new one is a little too flat and formulaic.  Not surprised to hear it’s succeeding.

It’s certainly liberal porn, but the plots and cons are more in the tradition of _Mission: Impossible_ in that it’s a team of con artists, each with a special set of skills.  (And now that I think of it, they each play close to type — there’s a black electronics whiz, a knockout female grifter, a strong and silent type, etc.  I can only assume that Timothy Hutton will be playing the gruff old [district attorney](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0384696/) on “Law and Order” in twenty years.)

Absolutely with you on the second season.  I suspect they’re up to something by playing to type, because Rogers is nothing if not clever . . . but outside of the premier, the second season has been dryly formulaic.  Maybe my suspicions are more like hope, but still, the first season’s easily worth a watch, no matter the measure.

Rogers is incredibly clever, but I believe he’s outranked on that show by Dean Devlin, who was the producer of what may well be the most mouthbreathing blockbuster of all time, _Independence Day_.

If, in twenty years, Timothy Hutton is not remembered first of all for the fantastic and wonderful work of his Nero Wolfe series, then there is no justice in the world.

Timothy Hutton played Nero Wolfe?  What, did he gain 300 pounds when I wasn’t looking.  Or did he play Archie Goodwin?  I guess I can see that working.

I haven’t been wowed yet by the new season, although I was pleasantly surprised by Christian Kane in the MMA episode: he’s even made me forget his Evil Hand.  I do hope they’ll step up, but really, the joy of the show isn’t with the plotting, which often makes no sense and relies on science fictional versions of technology: it’s in the characters and their interactions in service of people who can’t defend themselves.

It’s about time we got a popular show that was as explicitly anti-authoritarian as this one.  I’ve had too many years of cops and doctors and prosecutors and soldiers, no matter how engaging.  Give me someone operating _outside_ the system, and bent on exposing its flaws.

Actually, I think it’s more of an American version of _Hustle_ — with all the fun moral ambiguity and helpful post-con recap stripped out — than a millenial _A-Team_, but OK.

ari: Hutton played Goodwin.  Maury Chaykin played Wolfe.  [IMDB link.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283205/)

And re grackle: Doesn’t that depend on what else he makes?  I mean, you could have said the same thing about Hugh Laurie and \_Jeeves and Wooster\_… which would leave you looking rather foolish when he then went on to make \_House, M.D.\_.

P.S. Why no comparisons to \_The Equalizer\_?

Chris:  True enough but I bet Jeeves and Wooster outlasts House anyway.

_Timothy Hutton played Nero Wolfe?_ 

It’s his series because he created and produced it and directed a bunch of episodes, not because he played the title character.

Re: 30%!a(MISSING)udience failure

After showing an episode of Borat from Da Ali G Show (hey, Geography class, Central Asia week, whatelseareyagunnado?) to first years, talking about why it worked as comedy, and offering (a minuscule amount of) extra credit to write a geographic review of the then just-released feature-length _Borat_, **80%!(BADWIDTH)%!*(MISSING) of the students doing the assignment **did not get that Borat himself was fake**.  One closed her essay hopefully, saying that she believed Borat would take all the good things he learned in America back to his home country.

_One closed her essay hopefully, saying that she believed Borat would take all the good things he learned in America back to his home country._

To be fair, isn’t that what actually happened?  Unless this was one of the HBO episodes.

And supposedly some inexcusable %!o(MISSING)f the viewership doesn’t know that Colbert is satire.  I don’t know if I actually believe that — I guess I thought I was a pessimist about the big things, but not about the little ones.  

We either have to blunt the tools or sharpen ’em, because they’re not working out as is…

Loving what one does not understand (only when American?), and desiring to believe the criminals are complex and verge on the supercriminal, are quite different! The subtler thesis: Americans (_modern_ Americans, afflicted with, like, _modernity_ n’at), love the thesis that deep doings are being done, which they would not understand if they were aware of them; the show makes them aware of some, and, sure enough, they don’t understand ’em. But they aren’t loved _qua_ things not understood, but as signs loved for what they denote: something like the big city to the calculating, calculable modern’s resentful dweller in a manicured Levittown: at least something’s happening out there. It may be beyond the imagination of this two-bit burg, but great things are afoot, somewhere. (A prof here has a paper about related matters and _The Usual Suspects_. I have no idea where it might be appearing, though.)

You know I once had a five minute argument with a co-worker, when I worked in a mail room, about the Onion.  I insisted that it was a satirical weekly and he insisted that the story, perhaps about moonmen but I cannot recollect, was true.

The one about the moonmen \*was\* true.  They throw in a few true stories once in a while to keep people guessing.
