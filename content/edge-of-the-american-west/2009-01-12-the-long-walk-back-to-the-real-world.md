How do conservatives reconcile their cultural tastes with their partisan politics?  I don’t mean _generally_, because _generally_ the answer is they don’t think about their media consumption any more than your average liberal.  I mean _specifically_, that is, when they do consider how the media they consume intersects with the beliefs they profess, what happens?  Thanks to  [_Andrew Breitbart_](), we now have a daily glut of valuable insight into what it is to be a conservative for whom music, literature and film don’t nadir after Beethoven, Shakespeare and Bogart.  Admittedly, some of the revelations are old hat, as with [Breitbart’s confession](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/abreitbart/2009/01/11/my-first-assignment-gone-baby-gone/) of how certain conservatives really feel about the working poor:

Whoever cast the Boston grotesques that littered the film, my hat’s off to you. These profoundly ugly people really created a backdrop that made you want to root for the kid not to be found and brought back to her natural origins.

But most of _Big Hollywood_ is so awesomely counter-intuitive Walter Benn Michaels wouldn’t touch it with your ten-foot pole.  Exhibit A: Evan Sayet’s post on [Bruce Springsteen’s secret conservatism](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/esayet/2009/01/09/bruce-springsteen-one-hundred-percent-republican/), in which he claims

that, while Springsteen the multimillionaire, rock star with the mansion in Beverly Hills may be a Liberal, Bruce Springsteen the poet is one-hundred percent Republican.

Those of you currently reading Dante in your sophomore English classes take note: Sayet someone out.  Not that I need to tell you this, but the _Commedia_ is written by Dante the Man about Dante the Pilgrim _as narrated by Dante the Poet_.  The Poet is the fiction’s conceit—the character who remembers and recalls what happened after he found himself _per una selva oscura_—and is not to be treated coextensive with Dante the Man.  I invoke Dante here because Springsteen, like Dante, is frequently confused for his narrators by people who should know better.  No one reads “[Caliban upon Setebos](http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/267.html)” and mistakes the theological musings of Prospero’s deformed manservant for a definitive statement of Browning’s philosophy; whereas with Springsteen, every word his narrators utter is an expression of his personal beliefs _even when_ he opens with a lyric like “[[m]y name is Joe Roberts](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/HighwayPatrolman.html).” 


By these lights, Springsteen the Poet is a conservative because Joe Roberts believes a “man [who] turns his back on his family, well, he just ain’t no good.”  As that belief plugs neatly into the fallacy whereby family values are conservative values are Republican values, Springsteen the Poet would’ve been besotted by Sarah Palin and voting for John McCain.  If that sounds simple-minded, you likely won’t be impressed by Sayet’s Sowell-lite philosophizing: liberals believe “man is born good and then corrupted by the institutions of society,” whereas conservatives believe “man is born with a dual and conflicting nature—capable of good and evil and everything in between—requiring cultural forces to help him tamp down the darker side and cultivate the good within.”  By these druthers, any song in which options are weighed lilts conservative; any song that narrates the selection of the correct option must, therefore, be the product of a conservative mindset.  A song like “Imagine” is liberal because if there are no countries and no religions there is nothing to kill or die for—that is, without some system of belief around to adjudicate the merits of a decision, no choice is any more or less meaningful than any other.  Do what _feels_ right replaces do what _is_ right, and since doing wrong feels so right why don’t we do it in the road?  To Sayet’s mind, 

Springsteen . . . holds the diametrically opposed—Conservative—vision of man’s nature:

Two faces have I.  

One that laughs, one that cries.  

One says “hello,” one says “goodbye.”  

One says things I don’t understand.  

Makes me feel like half a man.

Since Springsteen recognizes that his feelings are conflicted, far from seeking the destruction of the civilizing forces, these are the things he specifically turns to for guidance:

At night I get down on my knees and pray  

I want to make that other man go away.

Couple of points to make here: first, Springsteen is a recovering Catholic; second, _Springsteen is a recovering Catholic_.  Has Sayet never met a recovering Catholic before?  Because _Tunnel of Love_ may be the quintessential statement of recovering Catholicism in the latter half of the last century.  Just ask [Walker Percy](http://books.google.com/books?id=Z83RmRyZ63kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%!i(MISSING)t+ain%!t(MISSING)+no+sin+to+be+glad+you%!r(MISSING)e+alive%!&(MISSING)ei=coxrSeGjGYrUkwSZpPGBDg&client=firefox-a#PPA189,M1).  Pick as many cherries as you like—and Sayet _loves_ cherries—you cannot turn Springsteen into an organization man:

Fairly early in Springsteen’s career, in the song “[Badlands](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/Badlands.html),” the Conservative poet takes a moment to contemplate what will bring him happiness in life.  He then runs through the usual possibilities, from losing oneself in his work to the accruing of fabulous riches, only to decide in the end that is “Faith that can save me.”

Strangely, Sayet fails to quote the song’s most famous lyric:

For the ones who had a notion,  

A notion deep inside.  

That it ain’t no sin  

To be glad you’re alive . . .

Except, were Springsteen the Catholic Sayet wants him to be, _it would be_.  Catholic’s have this funny idea about babies and the taint of sin—life is a journey, see, from sin to salvation, and this journey starts the moment you find yourself in _una selva oscura_ . . . but I’m not here to quibble about Catholic doctrine.  I concede that Springsteen’s thought was shaped by his Catholic upbringing.  I’ll even concede that the confessional _métier_ imparted by a Catholic upbringing makes for some fine art.  However, I steadfastly insist that writing songs in which your narrator feels conflicted does not a conservative make.  Misunderstanding fairly straightforward lyrics, hower . . . 

Springsteen sees the constraints of the Constitution as good, right and essential:

See that flag flying over the courthouse?  

It says certain things are set in stone.  

Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.

The combination of Catholic imagery and American iconography stand in stark contrast to the Neo-Liberal Lennon whose Utopian dreams require the dismantling of these things—of all codes and creeds beyond doing what feels good at any moment

Sayet correctly identifies Springsteen’s reverance for classical American iconography, but he misses _the entire point of the song_.  Those words are not spoken by the narrator—they don’t even appear in the song, actually, but I’m not here to nitpick about misquotation—they are spoken _to_ the narrator _by_ his father.  In “[Long Walk Home](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/LongWalkHome.html),” Springsteen’s narrator returns to the town where he was born and finds it in disrepair.  The local grocery and barbarshop are still there, but they’re manned and patonized by “rank strangers.”  The diner is dust.  The veteran’s hall stands “silent and alone.”  _Then_ the narrator recalls what his father told him: 

My father said,  

“Son, we’re lucky in this town.  

It’s a beautiful place to be born.  

It just wraps its arms around you,  

Nobody crowds you, nobody goes it alone.  

You know that flag flying over the courthouse?  

Means certain things are set in stone.  

Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.”

You don’t need my crack skills as a professional interpreter of words to recognize what Springsteen is up to here: the town through which the narrator currently walks, with its shuttered businesses and lonely veterans, resembles the town his father described in name alone.  Via a simple grammatical exercise, this point can be made abundantly clear.  Since the father’s statements were made in the past, I will put them in the past tense:

My father said,  

“Son, we **were** lucky in this town.  

It **was** a beautiful place to be born.  

It just **wrapped** its arms around you,  

Nobody **crowded** you, nobody **went** it alone.  

You know that flag flying over the courthouse?  

**Meant** certain things **were** set in stone.  

Who we **were**, what we **would’ve done** and what we **wouldn’t have done**.”

The last line clunks something awful, but the point should be clear: he doesn’t believe in the permanence of community or the continuity of shared cultural values.  The song documents how fragile the order his father cherished actually was.  The narrator wouldn’t return to his hometown and note that “it’s gonna be a long walk home” if “home” possessed the timeless virtues Sayet attributes to it.  What we have here, then, is a succinct example of the conservative break from reality:

A town falls to shit.  

A person notes that the town fell to shit and remembers what his father told him the town was like.  

A conservative comes along, examines the town, declares the father correct and attributes the sentiment to the son.  

“You and me, Bruce,” the conservative tells the son.  “We’re alike.”

“I’m not Bruce.”

“Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Whatever.  All that matters is you’re really just like me.”

“I don’t think what you think I think,” he replies.

“But you just—you just now said—you talked about how wonderful your hometown is.”

“Was.”

“Wrong!  I was listening.  You spoke in the present tense.”

“I _remembered_ in the present tense.”

“You _remembered_ how great this town is.”

“Was.”

“IS!”

“Was.”

“IS IS IS!”

“Was.”

“IS IS IS INFINITY NO TAKE BACKS!”

They work so hard to solve a problem that need never have arisen at all. Wikipedia has the [right line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel\_Goldwyn#Goldwynisms), but not in the form I remembered, “If you want to send a message, call Western Union.”

_…the point should be clear: he doesn’t believe in the permanence of community or the continuity of shared cultural values_

I think he does, and I think that’s the point: Americans don’t torture, and never will. Americans don’t imprison without trial, and never will, etc. It’s the timelessness that makes the narrator irrelevant. The irony (and the venom) of those lines are what makes the song. It’s all-American in its geography, its tone and its (overwhelmingly liberal) sentiment.

Great post, though.

Very nice. I’d also like to hear this guy explain away Bruce’s narrators always seem to be in a union:

“I met her at a dance down at the union hall”

“For my 19th birthday, I got a union card and a wedding coat”

“Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne’s”

How do these people reconcile “Nebraska” with this conservative Springsteen they construct?  That record is the ulimate indictment of the Reagan era.  Look, I have no problem with people deriving what they need from art, particularly music.  If this guy finds inspiration from Springsteen, who cares what the Springsteens politics actually are, or even the intent of the songs lyrics.  But to fashion a modern American conservative out of Springsteens lyrics in this way is quite a reach.  You have to will whole albums of his ouvre out of existance.  Not to mention the mans open support for a host of liberal causes.  They cannot grasp that someone can support soldiers and working people and liberalism at the same time, or the faith and hope in this country that Springsteen often injects into his music, along with the harsh criticism.  It’s a patriotism that is not founded on jingoism and blind faith in your leaders.  I guess the Kool-Aid is just too strong.

I used to taunt my Ohio-born college roommate–a huge Springsteen fan–with my whimsical interpretation of the Boss as a pedophilic stalker, lustfully crooning out:

_Hey little girl is your daddy home  

Did he go and leave you all alone  

I got a bad desire  

oooh I’m on fire_

But I was joking.  According to Sayet’s brand of criticism, someone should be calling the District Attorney.

Yes, I see.  

 I recall a couple of years ago Terry Gross of NPR was interviewing a member of a band which was famous for their outlandish stage act and costumes. I forget the exact line of questioning but at one point the band member said that their act was more real then Springteen’s. When Gross expressed disbelief he pointed out the Springsteen, who is a multimillionaire,  is playing the part of a working man, taking  to the stage wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

Ah… yes.  Bruce Springsteen.  The man so conservative that he performed free concerts for BARACK OBAMA.  Gah!

BTW: the Is/Was dispute is one easily cleared up by simply translating it into the Latin.  If he’s using the pluperfect, you’re right.  If he’s using the present tense, you’re wrong…

We can’t have this conversation without recalling this:

[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzZkNDU5MmViNzVjNzkzMDE3NzNlN2MyZjRjYTk4YjE=](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzZkNDU5MmViNzVjNzkzMDE3NzNlN2MyZjRjYTk4YjE=)

Yes, the National Review listed the 50 best conservative rock songs, a list that includes such conservative luminaries as:

The Who  

The Beatles (Lennon must have been conservative if he’s so conflicted)  

The Rolling Stones  

U2  

The Sex Pistols  

Bob Dylan  

The Pretenders  

The Clash  

David Bowie (who also sang “I’m Afraid of Americans”)  

CCR  

The Band

You’ll note that they also interpret any song with even a hint of anti-communist sentiment as fully conservative. This isn’t a new conservative trick.

Well, remember it was conservatives who invented trasformismo at the dawn of mass democracy as a way to pull the teeth of both radical left and right. 

And hey, I think it’s nice to see conservatives catching on to the cultural logic of discursive repurposing, a little détournement here from an unexpected quarter, they’ll be dropping bitch and nigga and queer bombs next and we’ll all be one big happy family of radical polysemics.

**[reharmonizer](http://reharmonized.an-earful.com/)**

					

		

Yeah, Sayet says that a conservative believes that man is born “capable of good and evil and everything in between” and I sure believe that. So I’m a conservative, too, it seems.

Anyway, his idea of what makes a “Neo-Liberal” has all the depth of an annoying neighbor character on a mediocre sitcom. His conservative isn’t much deeper, though, and there seems to be no in between. So he manages to insult most anyone with half a brain, plus some with less than half, judging from the comment thread over there.

There’s a certain breed of thinker that thinks that if he/she has a certain political persuasion, then anything he/she likes is also of that persuasion.  Sort of an anthropic principle for preferences.

“The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” was, it turns out, a celebration of the values of the Confederacy, sung by that Good Ol’ Girl, Joan Baez.  All these years I thought that the song was just saying “war sucks, and we should feel bad even for the people on the wrong side, when they lose.”  Someone alert Rolling Stone, I think there’s a story in this one.

“you likely won’t be impressed by Sayet’s Sowell-lite philosophizing: liberals believe “man is born good and then corrupted by the institutions of society,” whereas conservatives believe “man is born with a dual and conflicting nature—capable of good and evil and everything in between”

Hmm, I always thought it was kinda the other way around – at least, as a progressive, I think the capacity for good and evil exists in all of us and we have to work hard as a society to make sure that the good wins out, while it seems to me that conservatives believe some people are born good and some people are born bad and it’s the good guys’ job to convert or kill the bad ones. That’s why you have to be born again if you’re bad, right?
