I do believe that we’ve treated electoral fraud as a joke for too long, and that it’s past time to do something about it.

Translation:

Now that my party faces the prospect of losing an election due to the Obama campaign’s GOTV initiatives, it’s time to stop laughing about voter fraud and start investigating all the dead people, illegal immigrants, and colored folk who have suddenly appeared on our once pristine voter rolls.
