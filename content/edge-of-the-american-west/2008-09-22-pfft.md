[Glenn Reynolds](http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/024709.php):

I do believe that we’ve treated electoral fraud as a joke for too long, and that it’s past time to do something about it.

Translation:

Now that my party faces the prospect of losing an election due to the Obama campaign’s GOTV initiatives, it’s time to stop laughing about voter fraud and start investigating all the dead people, illegal immigrants, and colored folk who have suddenly appeared on our once pristine voter rolls.

I understand — wait, no I don’t understand, but I _accept_ — your need to punish yourself by reading blogs like Instapundit.  But why do you torture the rest of us, too?

They’re already preparing themselves for defeat and tooling up the fraud and stabbed-in-the-back stories.

I wonder about the returning troops. Two mothers I know say that they can’t talk to their own Iraq War vet sons about the war. They come back convinced that only people who fought there know what really was happening. I suspect that they’re encouraged to think that by their commanders.

_They come back convinced that only people who fought there know what really was happening._

In what way is this different from any other war ever?

It’s in my contract, Josh.  Blame eric.

John, what worries me is that they’re prepared to be pro-active — to repeat 2000 before the fact, thereby forestalling the need for consolation in defeat.

Exactly.  What Reynolds says is neither here nor there, except as it may indicate that the “vote fraud” bogeyman will be invoked more effectively somewhere else.

It’s the first instantiation of the counter-narrative.  Reynolds and his ilk have spent the past eight years laughing at the “joke” of voter fraud, despite all the evidence that it existed — there’s a reason the Democrats have a chance in Ohio this year — but now they’re going to have to start validating the very claims they laughed off.  

But I’m sure the timing’s a coincidence.

“It’s bad if it happens to me” is a Republican motto; witness the outcry about the sexist mistreatment of Sarah Palin, by the exact same folks who pooh-poohed same in the case of Clinton. But there’s a sleazier thing happening here too, one that Republicans have been working on for a while. That is, not just the real-life type frauds of Ohio et al, but the sinister threat of millions of illegal immigrants voting for Obama, of poor black folk voting again and again for Obama. These things don’t and won’t happen, and there’s no evidence that they have or might. But if we scare-monger about them, we can enforce tougher voter registration and ID regulations, and thereby inhibit real voters from voting. And as we all know, the fewer people vote, the better the Republicans do. 

But I guess everyone here knows all of this already, and I’ve just overearnested.

Josh: I was pretty elliptical. The soldiers believed that the media were lying, that the general public is all wrong, that we were winning the war, and that they had been betrayed. And they blew off their own mothers. 

Eric, we can expect a last ditch attempt to steal the election, but you need a very close election to succeed with that. Sabotaging and delegitimizing the incoming President is something that can be done if that fails. A lot of Republicans do seem dispirited, and by the bungling it really seems that the McCain camp doesn’t have the A team on the field.

If I’m not mistaken, “Voter fraud” usually means fraud by voters, whereas “election fraud” usually means official misconduct. Maybe Reynolds slipped. “Voter fraud” is a pretext for voter denial and discouragement efforts.

I have freepers in my family.  One thing I can tell you with a great deal of certainty is that they haven’t been laughing about vote fraud.  They believe to the depths of their souls that the Democrats perpetrate enormous amounts of vote fraud every year, which is the only reason that the elections are even close.  The freepers take this as a matter of faith.  

This is one of those hot buttons they invoke every cycle to whip up the faithful.  It’s right up there with “liberal media”, “gun control”, and “abortion rights.”  Seriously.  This isn’t a new thing.  They’ve been on this for a long, long time.

Yeah, I have to say I don’t quite get that part of SEK’s point, either, Jake.  Since when did the right wing laugh off charges of voter fraud?  They’ve been hyping them in the media, in court, and in the DOJ for . . .  I dunno, a hella long time.

In what sense do you see them laughing these charges off, SEK?  Are you thinking in terms of OH ’04 and FL 2000?

The right wing laughs off the credible charges of voter fraud that have them being perpetrators.

urbino, ben pretty much nails it.  They’ve been laughing off Democratic claims — usually in reference to Florida in ’00 and Ohio in ’04 — that there have been wide-scale “irregularities” in the voting process the past two elections.  It’s one of Rush’s favorite themes.
