## Initial debate impression

Tonight the Republican Party outed itself as [the proud parent of a C- student](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/):

Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president. And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president’s agenda in that position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we’ll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation.

I admit: unedited transcripts make everyone sound like an idiot.  However, so does sounding like an idiot.  I’m with [Burke](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=649) and [Bérubé](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/so\_you\_palin\_mockers\_think\_youre\_so\_smart/) on this one: she sounded like a student bluffing her way through an exam she crammed for three hours earlier.  At times she was passable — but only barely.  She tacked back to her charted course five seconds into every answer, irrespective of the question, because she could only fit so much on those notecards the cameras didn’t once catch her repeatedly shuffling through — did I just call them notecards?

I meant _cheat sheets_.  Please, America, I beg of you: be as smart as the squiggly lines CNN had representing your core convictions are accurate.  Live up to the ideals embodied by 
those squiggly lines
 our Founding Fathers.

I was just chatting with a couple that watched it on Fox and CNN.  Apparently the Fox audience of completely independent voters in St. Louis all agreed that Palin won.  

What are the odds of that?  She must have wiped the floor with that Biden guy.

two pieces of good news:  

1) this will probably stop the calls for her resignation from conservatives (e.g. george will, kathleen parker).  

that’s good. it means he’s stuck with her.  

the wills and parkers will continue to fret and fume, but he’s stuck with her.

2) now that she’s a brilliant success as a debater–just ask fox news’ entirely random selection of completely independent republican party apparatchiks!–the mccain campaign has no excuse for her not giving plenty of press conferences and interviews and doing lots of talk shows. whenever they say “she really won that debate!”, we say, “great, so when will she be available for questions?”

They weren’t cheat sheets, they were alternative news sources. She reads them ALL so naturally she has to be reading ALL THE TIME. In debating Joe Biden, her brain was multitasking at a rate that WE CANNOT COMPREHEND.

This moment caught my attention as well.  It struck me both for its stylistic virtuoso and weak grasp of constitutional history.  No surprise, of course, since much of our political discourse trades on imagined history and outright myth.

As a former and future grader of Intro to American Politics,  Governor Palin would not receive full credit for that answer.

More shocking–although I suppose I should be immune by now–is her almost complete ignorance of the difficult constitutional questions raised in the last eight years.  Its not just that she refuses to address the question of appropriate scope of VP power, but she seems ignorant even of the salience of the question.

Sarah Palin is aware of all difficult constitutional questions.

Thank God George McClellan has taken over in Afghanistan.  On to Richmond!

That’s waaay too hasty there, silbey.

“With all his failings as a soldier, McClellan is a pleasant and scholarly gentleman. He is an admirable engineer, but he seems to have a special talent for a stationary engine.”

_That’s waaay too hasty there, silbey._

On to a position close to Richmond, from there to retreat precipitously at the merest hint of resistance?

Doesn’t have the same ring.

One of the many reason why Sarah Palin reminds me (and apparently many other teachers and academics) of a student trying to b.s. her way through an exam is the way in which her nouns and verbs don’t entirely line up.  Her answers involve mentioning a series of (potentially) relevant concepts without really committing to any particular relationship among them.

Take this answer on the economy (which Josh Marshall highlighted on TPM this morning):

_Yes, I would have. But here, again, there have — there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street._
 _

We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCain’s call for reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse.

And the colleagues in the Senate weren’t going to go there with him. So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people. And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do what’s right to fix this economic problem that we are in.
_ 

_It is a crisis. It’s a toxic mess, really, on Main Street that’s affecting Wall Street. And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets don’t seize up. That’s where the Main Streeters like me, that’s where we would really feel the effects_

It’s hard to put one’s finger on exactly what Palin is claiming here, in part because she really isn’t claiming anything at all.  JMM focused on the apparent claim in the last paragraph that a “toxic mess” on Main Street is hurting Wall Street, but I think that’s, in effect, an unintended consequence of the order in which the concepts in this word cloud happened to come out of Palin’s mouth. Palin’s “argument” was merely to put the words “toxic mess,” “Main Street,” and “Wall Street” in the same sentence. This is about vaguely associating concepts and hoping to get credit for doing so, not actually proposing a particular relationship among those concepts.

A number of people ([including JMM](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/221614.php), again) pointed out last night that the biggest difference between the debate and the Couric interviews was the lack of follow-up questions in the former. I think this is absolutely correct, but we shouldn’t underestimate the ability of the internets, and especially YouTube, to function as a kind of socialized opportunity for the audience to follow up.  Though Palin is certainly better at this format than at a sit-down interviews with journalists willing to ask her to clarify her non-answers, her non-answers are still non-answers…and not even very good non-answers as that debased genre goes.  

Even at its best, this particular style of responding to questions was really built for an age in which the audience didn’t have the ability to more or less instantly watch clips and read transcripts of the non-answers. So whatever the first impression of Palin’s performance (which seems to be “good, but not as good as Biden”) may begin to slip as the clips circulate.  Turns out everyone’s a gotcha journalist, Gov. Palin!

I think she’s claiming that John McCain is the man, and we should thank him for that.

Thanks for the articulate appraisals, and all spot-on.  

Gee whiz, but this thing bored me so much I couldn’t drink fast enough to get riled up and turned to reading (a book!) for fun.

p.s. McClellan is/was a pussy.

_gotcha!_

I believe that followups were not allowed, no?

I think, though, that insisting that the question asked actually be answered is not, technically, a followup.

You know, McClellan did end up as governor of a small state…

 On to Trenton!

You mentioned bullshit, and I’m glad you did!

Yeah, it’s the concepts that don’t line up, the verbs without objects, the over-reliance on metaphor.  Reminds me of way too many econ essay answers, with the right tracks and shorings up.

The other clue is the effort to fill space or in this case time.  The current President is an interesting counterexample.  He sometimes says things that are hard to parse, but he usually keeps answers short: he’s smart enough not to bluff and confident enough to give you less than you expected.

_an unintended consequence of the order in which the concepts in this word cloud happened to come out of Palin’s mouth._

There were a couple of other times — I am _not_ going back over the transcript, dammit — when she got the causality on a fairly obvious statement bassackwardsand just plowed ahead as if what came out of her mouth made perfect sense.

I just wish she’d have stopped trying to talk about energy — she’d duck every question and go back to energy. She used an outdated figure for the amount of money we use to buy offshore oil, while ramming “Drill baby drill” down the throats of viewers everywhere. At least Biden pointed out that it’d take ten years to get one drop of oil from these “offshore” derricks.

It might take ten years to get one drop of oil from these “offshore” derricks, but the First Dude’s peers could be building them and doing prep work much sooner than that…got to keep that cohort employed, after all.

 It is almost Keynesian, although I don’t know if Gov. Hruska would see it that way…
