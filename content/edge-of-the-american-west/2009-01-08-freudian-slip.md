Sentence from an email I sent a student:

You don’t need to apologize for emailing me two hours after class about an assignment not due until [much later].  It shows that you’re on top of things, and professors love stupids who are on top of things.

I know they’re not homonyms, but, you know—if anyone’s looking to unload property under a rock, drop me a line.
