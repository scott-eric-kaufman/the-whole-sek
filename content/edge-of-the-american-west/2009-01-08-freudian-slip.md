## Freudian slip?

Sentence from an email I sent a student:

You don’t need to apologize for emailing me two hours after class about an assignment not due until [much later].  It shows that you’re on top of things, and professors love stupids who are on top of things.

I know they’re not homonyms, but, you know—if anyone’s looking to unload property under a rock, drop me a line.

that’s very funny. indeed, awesome.  

maybe you should write back to the kid and tell him you’ve been reading matt yglesias too much? some of his substitutions go far beyond homonymic confusion, into free-association-land.

Blame it on the spell-checker, Scott. 

Or you could say something about education being the exploration of your own ignorance…. 

Just for reference, by the way: caves, like the underside of rocks, are hard, cold, often moist, and rarely have enough bookshelf space, even for office use.

You have to stick to the Shaggy defense (‘It wasn’t me’). Blame it on word-completion software on your cell phone.

Best of luck. lol

teofilo: OK, yeah. But that’s like the R-1 of rock undersides: it’s unfair to the rest of us to assume that we all have access to the same resources!

Some people have to split time under multiple rocks and still are unable to obtain full coverage.

Whiners.  Those people need to have started looking for places under rocks 800 years ago.  And have supportive spouses.

_So much for your stupid evaluations._

I’d agree with you here were it not for the fact that last quarter—in which I blew as a teacher, because I was rusty as fuck—my evaluations were all like “I feel like Scott was really approachable and always had a sense of passion when teaching.”  I was going to write a post about how I somehow managed to not scare any students away this quarter, despite telling them they’d be required to write _five posts of 500 words every week_.  I was all set to call it “This Charming Man?” before The Wife put her foot down and said, “The Husband?  No.”

(Also, one of the wait-listed students I had to turn away was from the same very, very small town in New Jersey that I’m from.  Given that 99.99 percent of UCI students are from the OC, having someone who also attended [Fernbrook Elementary](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=fernbrook+elementary,+randolph,+new+jersey&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=41.411029,93.164063&ie=UTF8&ll=40.873286,-74.564896&spn=0.077492,0.181961&z=13&iwloc=A) was all kinds of awesome . . . and yet, I couldn’t add her, because no one dropped.  Granted, my 8 a.m. class consists entirely of dance majors who just finished practice and baseball players who must jet to practice at 9:20 on the dot means that I’ve got a strangely committed bunch.)  (Did I also mention I’ve been up since 5:30 a.m.?  Because I have, and I just might be a wee bit delirious.)

Sadly, because I have to tell my students I’m deaf the first day of class — [or else](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/two\_posts\_writt.html) — they know I don’t do cells.

We all make student mistakes sometimes.  Hardly a day goes by that I don’t write something really fucking student.

So much for trying to sneak back out from under my last rock (space available now SEK!) while nobody was noticing.

In a hole in the ground there lived an assistant professor. Not a adjunct’s hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell,  

nor yet a dry, bare graduate student’s hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was an assistant professor’s hole, and that means comfort.

Reminds me of Argentinian Roberto DeVincenzo’s great remark upon missing out on a chance to win the 1968 Masters in a playoff when he signed an incorrect scorecard: “What a stupid I am!”

It’s only rarely that I get a student whose question as you describe it means they’re ‘on top of things’, although I give all of them the benefit of the doubt for a while. More likely, the things they’re on top of are their own fretful anxiety, my butt for some kissin’, my toes as I attempt to sequence instruction, and eventually my nerves. Take a deep breath there kiddies, and trust the process.
