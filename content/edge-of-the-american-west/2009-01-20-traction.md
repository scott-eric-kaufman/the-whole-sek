What are the odds that conservatives will claim Obama’s flubbing of the oath of office was but the first of many mistakes?  Set aside the fact that Roberts goofed by asking Obama to repeat something other than [the Oath of Office of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath\_of\_office#United\_States) — “I do solemnly swear that I will execute the Office of President of the United States _faithfully_” instead of “I do solemnly swear that I will _faithfully_ execute the Office of President of the United States.”  Set aside the fact that Obama graciously gave Roberts a beat to correct himself.  Set aside the fact that this is but one more example of a Bush appointee not sweating the small stuff when it mattered most.

This supposed flub will be the rhetorical starting gate for all holistic criticisms of the Obama Administration: “From the moment an unprepared Obama punted the Oath of Office, America started sucking . . .”
