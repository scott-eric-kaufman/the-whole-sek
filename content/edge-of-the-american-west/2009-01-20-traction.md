## Traction?

What are the odds that conservatives will claim Obama’s flubbing of the oath of office was but the first of many mistakes?  Set aside the fact that Roberts goofed by asking Obama to repeat something other than [the Oath of Office of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath\_of\_office#United\_States) — “I do solemnly swear that I will execute the Office of President of the United States _faithfully_” instead of “I do solemnly swear that I will _faithfully_ execute the Office of President of the United States.”  Set aside the fact that Obama graciously gave Roberts a beat to correct himself.  Set aside the fact that this is but one more example of a Bush appointee not sweating the small stuff when it mattered most.

This supposed flub will be the rhetorical starting gate for all holistic criticisms of the Obama Administration: “From the moment an unprepared Obama punted the Oath of Office, America started sucking . . .”

100%! (MISSING) The rhetorical device is too tempting.

I expect that the first “the oath of office was wrong and late and therefore we no longer have a government but a foreign occupation” (Zionist Islamicist Government, ZIG) post has already gone up somewhere. It’s been three hours, after all!

So wait, the Bush-appointed strict constructionist Chief Justice is unfamiliar with what’s in the Constitution?

I’ve been googling for comparisons of the Inauguration to a Nuremberg rally, but have only found two. Perhaps they’re taking a little longer so that they can do a good job of it.

What are the odds that conservatives will say that the flubbing of the oath means he’s not really president? I’d say “pretty good.”

My take was the same as SE’s, — Roberts flubbed it. This does not negate the fact that Obama has yet to take the oath of office.

Drip, are you arguing that this matters? “Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation…” doesn’t imply, I think, that the accession is contingent on the oath.

Given that the constitution doesn’t seem to say exactly _how_ the oath should be administered, or _when_, presumably Obama could do it in the shower tomorrow morning, if it’s really that important that the precise wording be intoned.

Ben’s almost right.  Except that you just know Obama was practicing it in the shower \*this\* morning, which is why he noticed when Roberts gave him the wrong words.

Constantly.  And I’m here to report he got the oath exactly right this morning.  The man’s diction is amazing, even with his mouth full.

I am not arguing that it matters. I am certain that it doesn’t. It is hilarious that that Roberts addressed the new guy with the wrong name (Senator), gave him a fake pause after his name and then asked him to take some oath that Roberts made up because he was too vain to read it off a note card, which a man with some self awareness and humility would have done. In fact, as of noon on the 20th of January, Obama was president. U S Constitution Amend. 20 sec. 1.: _The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin._ No oath mentioned here, so . . . whenever, I guess. This is a Justice at work.

Yeah, on the NBC feed, someone — Brian Williams? — said very quietly after the “Air and Simple Gifts” ended that Obama had already been president for four minutes, i.e., before taking the oath.  I think this is correct.

Also, presidents have previously taken the oath [more than once](http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pioaths.html).

It’s his era though. The 20th Amendment was ratified January 23, 1933. Probably because of the delay in installing FDR?

Roberts does not necessarily believe that black people should vote, etc., so maybe today was torture for him.

Why twice for Hayes? I can see why Arthur would have been sworn in twice, because of the circumstances of his accession, but for Hayes the date would have been known ahead of time (even with the disputed election) wouldn’t it?

You might think so, but it had been pushed (by Senator Norris) and voted by Congress long before that.

_Reading on, I see Wilson, Eisenhower, and Reagan all had two oaths in quick succession._

Well, to be fair, Reagan’s was because when they finished the first time he came out of a fugue and said, “Well, are we ready to start?” and nobody wanted to embarrass him, so they did it all over again.

_Don’t taunt the heathens, Eric._

That’s no joke. We’re out for blood now. Warren’s Incantation was one thing, but then whatshisname’s Bloviation really sent us over the edge. Somebody spilled God all over this sombitch.

Roberts also phrased the add-on phrase at the end “so help me God” as a question, both in wording (switching to “you” rather than “I”) and in very obvious inflection: “So help you God?” As if it were a gotcha question.

I was just watching the C-SPAN livestream where they have two presidential historians chatting with a host, and they started taking callers. The first was a woman who had two points: (1) she’s embarrassed at how Aretha Franklin “butchered” _My Country ‘Tis of Thee_; and (2) she was glad that Roberts flubbed the oath of office and she hopes (and believes) that it was intentional. That’s our melting pot.

I’m absolutely willing to believe that Robert’s flubbing was intentional. I think its part of a plot to prevent Obama from busting out his secret Indonesian birth certificate now that he’s safely in office.

it’s telling that even the chief supreme court justice appointed by the now former failure-in-chief could not competently administer a simple oath.

let’s hope that president obama can quickly get the remaining members of bushco out of the federal government.

you don’t know conservatives, miriam.

it was an admission of guilt! it proves that for over 24 hours he was illegally occupying the white house! it sets a precedent for the reckless illegality that will mark his term–he couldn’t bear to speak the sacred lines of the constitution without turning into a bat and flying out of the window!

etc. etc.

but, yeah–i actually do think it’s a precedent. he showed an abundance of caution. he acted quickly to kill a stupid non-story. let’s hope it’s dead.
