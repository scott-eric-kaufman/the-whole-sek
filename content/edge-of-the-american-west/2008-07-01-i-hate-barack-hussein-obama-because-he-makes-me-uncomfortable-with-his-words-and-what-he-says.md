(_Hearing Obama’s remark about respecting those who “__make us uncomfortable with their words” got me thinking:_ _what would happen if [my irate former student](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) got his hands on [Roget’s regnant tome](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/all\_scribes\_uti.html) and started [bloviating about Obama on the Internet](http://www.marchosis.com/showthread.php?p=4028)?_)

First in the foremost if you are stimulated by new ideas because you are the kind of person like me and you can think for yourself rather than simply accept what Obama says as ultimate truth I think you will find this post importantly of interest to you.

I guess I should start by saying that what Obama thinks is not what he says and even what he says he thinks only provides cover for an incoherent agenda of sorts.  Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such ideas as the ones Obama has profligated the underlying premise of all of them is flawed and you can tell this is the ontological truth of the matter because of the insults he employs like raucous scoundrel and pugnacious.

But if you look soberly and carefully at the evidence all around you on the television you will obviously see Obama’s grandisonant effusions are not pedantic treatises expressing theories or extravaganzas dealing in fables or fancies they are substantial sober outpouring from the very soul of demagogism.

Now stay with me for a moment here because I am making a point.  Specifically that there may be nothing we can do to prevent Obama from making good on his word to destabilize and undermine the already volatile social fabric he purportedly aims to save.

When we compare this disturbing conclusions I have drawn from the premises presented we can only conclude that the comforting picture purveyed by his conspirators and feel what is called by experts cognitive dissonance from it.  Our only recourse is to kick ass and take down names.

If his attempts to perpetuate what we all know is a corrupt system have spurred us to challenge his uncouth libidinous assumptions about merit then Obama may have accomplished a useful thing because if we are to set our sights on eternity then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology not by the salacious ornithological ideologies Obama promotes.

It is possible that Obama does not realize this because he has been imbibed by so much of the propaganda of quislingism and if that is the case as I believe it to be then I tremulantly recommend we halt the malmish adulation heaped upon wretched misfits.  If anything Obama has hair in his brain and even though we all are to some extent as hairy Obama sets the bar on the curve that much higher up the mountain.

Does Obama have trouble living with himself knowing that he gets perfervid about unilateralism because whenever that question is asked Obama and his conspirators run and hide.  I suspect that that is precisely what they are going to do now so as to avoid hearing me say that Obama’s bloodthirsty _ipse dixits_ leave the current power structure untouched while simultaneously killing countless children through the starvation of disease.

ARE THE CHILDREN HIS ENEMIES?

As you know doubt realize by now that is a particularly timely question because in fact I just half an hour ago heard someone express the opinion that Obama may be reasonably cunning with words and what he says even though he is nerdy with everything else.

Obama believes that ageism resonates with the body’s natural alpha waves but unfortunately as long as he believes such absurdities he will continue to commit atrocities.

Let us not sink to his level and let us combat plagiarism by exercising our right to speak out and denounce his publicitiy stunts as totally unrepresentative of the valuves of this society and let me conclude by stating that Obama’s brain must work very differently from mine because it is black.

You can quote me on that.
