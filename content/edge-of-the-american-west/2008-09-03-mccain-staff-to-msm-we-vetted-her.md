(_blows into tuner_)

They say we never vetted her,  

The Old Gray Lady lies!  

Now hear why we can bet on her,  

Plain truth they can’t deny:

We vetted her by land,  

We vetted her by sea;  

We vetted nook and cran,  

(Where all best vetting be).

We vetted her through sleet,  

We vetted her through snow;  

We vetted all her sheets,  

But netted no eye-holes.

We vetted all her homes,  

We vetted all her locks.  

(Sam vetted her with ham,  

In boxcars with a fox.)

We vetted all her friends,  

We vetted all her beaus.  

(We would’ve vetted Luke,  

But he _yee-hawed!_ the road.)

We vetted both her hands,  

We vetted all her guns;  

We vetted target ranges,  

Then vetted us some fun.

We vetted her up high,  

Through clouds into blue sky;  

We vetted her down low,  

Where earmarks roil the sty.

We vetted her in caves,  

Deep in Afghanistan,  

Then vetted her for days,  

Through half of Pakistan.

We vetted ’til her bloated,  

Blood-swollen as a tick,  

To say she wasn’t vetted  

Would be a—_hic_; a —_hic_; a—_hic_;

‘Twould be impolitic.

Am I aware the meter stumbles when I mention the Duke boys?  Yes.  Do I know how to fix it?  That’s what you people are for.

I don’t have video of this (yet), but I’m trying to track it down. If you saw it, you saw how devastatingly bad it was.

Andrea Mitchell: Do you feel Sarah Palin is qualified to be commander-in-chief if God forbid, something should happen to John McCain?

Joe Lieberman: Well…you know…let’s assume the best (chuckles uncomfortably). John’s in great shape, he’s gonna be the president and let’s assume that nothing bad will happen…why should we? But if it does…yes, she’ll be ready.

Obsess much? 

Am I to now expect a daily Palin bashing, or will you focus your sharp wit on, oh, I don’t know, the man who’s running for president on the Republican side?

 _Obsess much?_

So hard not to rubberneck when there’s a car accident on the road.

 _will you focus your sharp wit on, oh, I don’t know, the man who’s running for president on the Republican side?_ McCain is going to be around for awhile. Palin will disappear as soon as the convention is over. Unless, that is, she debates Biden. [Jennifer Marlowe] (http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0029680/) vs  [BJ Hunnicutt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike\_Farrell). It just might be beyond mockery.

We can vet, and vet, and vet, but all our vetting will never trump the simple fact: “life happens.”
