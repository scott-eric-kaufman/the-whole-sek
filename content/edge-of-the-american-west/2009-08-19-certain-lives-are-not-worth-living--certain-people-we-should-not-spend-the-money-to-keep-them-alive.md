## “Certain lives are not worth living.  Certain people, we should not spend the money to keep them alive…”

Consider this a bookend to Ari’s [post](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/it-is-not-yet-a-matter-for-international-concern/), as those are the words of Hitler according to this protester:


According to her and those like her, Hitler didn’t _actively conspire to murder millions of people in the service of a racist eugenics_, he passively refused to “spend the money to keep them alive.”  Who are “they” here?  Because she claims that “limiting Medicare expenditures in order to reduce the deficit . . . _is_ the T-4 policy of the Hitler—of a Hitler policy in 1939,” she must be talking about those killed under the auspices of the _Aktion T-4 Euthanasie_: the _lebensunwertes Leben_, or “life unworthy of life,” _i.e._ the elderly, the mentally disabled and the otherwise infirm.  Par for the course for those who believe in “death panels.”

However, if people like this protester possessed a perspective of more depth and extension than the Wikipedia Brand Knowledge currently bandied about conservative discussion boards and listservs, they would know, for example, that the _T-4_ initiative was prohibitively expensive.  Its predecessor, the _Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses_, or “Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring,” which mandated the sterilization of the physically and mentally disabled, had been scaled back because it was too expensive.  That is, they _stopped_, not _started_, the ideologically-based murders of those they considered defective because it would save Germany a few million _Reichsmarks_.

This should go without saying: the Nazis _wanted_ to kill these people, they simply couldn’t _afford_ to.  In fact, it was only in 1939, after they’d planted a war on both horizons, that Hitler could justify the expense required to expand the _T-4_ initiative into the concentration camps.

In short, whatever Obama’s policy will be, if it is, as this protester claims, designed to _reduce_ the national deficit, it won’t resemble _Aktion T-4_ one whit.  Moreover, the category of _lebensunwertes Leben_ wasn’t limited to those with mental or physical handicaps as we currently understand them: opponents of Nazi policy were routinely deemed to be insane and euthanized, meaning that so long as this protester and those like her are free to berate Barney Frank with patent nonsense, [Godwin’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%!s(MISSING)\_law) is still in full effect.

To “shorter” my own post: “Genocide is expensive.”

i think i love barney frank.  i thought i did already, but i don’t follow him closely, and a clip like this is enough to make my day.

yeah, i agree with dan — you’re unfair to wikipedia.  and, yes, you are right on the reasoning — especially, that the nazis _wanted_ to kill people, that was the goal.  but this kind of nonsense is not susceptible to facts and reasoning.

I want to get a button that says, “I’m gay for Barney Frank.”

Regarding Godwin, I thought Perlstein had a nice, nuanced take in his [Washington Post chat](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/08/14/DI2009081402554.html):

Brownshirts weren’t brownshirts at first. They were just angry people who felt dispossessed by the course Germany took after World War I. This kind of entropy–angry people exploited by elites–is a pattern in history, and it shouldn’t be denied. We all have to draw the line as to what kinds of expression of dispossession are illegitimate. People who believed in democracy in Germany didn’t have “Godwin’s Law” to throw at each other in 1925, and 1928, and 1930. They just had to figure out for themselves when things were getting out of hand. We share that same responsibility. I intend a historical parallel to the 1920s in Germany–not a claim that my political adversaries “are” Nazis. They aren’t. But they are beginning to violate the bonds of civility that hold a healthy democracy together.

Wikipedia does many things well, but one of them is to provide the illusion of expertise—by which I mean, it works too well sometimes, especially when the conclusions one wants to reach are tendentious.

For example, the best way to refute my analysis would be to cite public outcry against the _Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses_ as a reason for their ostensible repeal, and follow that by pointing out that they were only repealed in name alone, and that such practices continued . . . to which I would reply, yes, but that’s why I chose “scaled back” as my operative verb, and a lively discussion could ensue.  I don’t, however, anticipate having that discussion with someone whose knowledge about this period comes exclusively from one or two Wikipedia entries.

_Wikipedia does many things well, but one of them is to provide the illusion of expertise_

I advise students to use Wikipedia purely for introductory purposes, expecting them to follow links to primary and secondary sources. I At that point, their interest in a given topic should move to edited historiography and a broader array of monographs. I’m relatively certain that clear Wikipedia citation hyperlinks encourage readers to do so. Your criticism may be self-evident, no? But, then again, publishers at Oxford University Press are currently hard at work furnishing reading publics with more in-depth [short introductions](http://books.google.com/books?id=BtSU6ZaCbzMC&dq=short+introduction+to+new+deal).

In controlled classroom settings, this works.  On the internet . . . not so much.

_On the internet . . . not so much_

I’ve linked to Wikipedia once on here, and I see that several commenters link to it on a regular basis. My students use wikis on a daily basis. At this point in the game, criticism of wiki links is tantamount to criticizing the horse after it left the barn. Perhaps a better approach might be to offer a word of caution. For example, make a given commenter’s motivations explicit, such as the inclusion of _for introductory purposes_ only. 

On that note, Richard Evans just published his third volume in his reassessment of the Nazi regime. Regardless of scholars’ views on Evans as a reformed postmodern historian, readers should [check it out](http://books.google.com/books?id=0XZHSyTLyIMC&dq=third+reich+at+war&client=firefox-a).

It would be more appropriate to describe the protester as possessing [“Conservapedia](http://conservapedia.com/Obamacare) Brand Knowledge.”

_Wikipedia Brand Knowledge_

I laughed at that, but then your comment on wikis or pedias or whatever confused me, given that readers need to know why you referred to it as _brand knowledge_ in order to get the joke. You sorta assumed a target audience, so I did, too. Still, point well taken.

I like the Conservapedia’s _Disinformation_ section.
