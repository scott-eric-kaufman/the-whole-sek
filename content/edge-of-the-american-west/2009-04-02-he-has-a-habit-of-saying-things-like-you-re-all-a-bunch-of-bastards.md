## He has a habit of saying things like “You’re all a bunch of bastards!”

Conservatives are upset at the classless behavior of the Obamas when they met with the Queen and Prince Philip today, and I must say, they have a point.  An iPod loaded with show tunes and the footage she requested of her 2007 visit to the States?  _Show tunes_?  Even if they matched the ones in the signed Rodgers and Hammerstein songbook, and even if that songbook would be rare given that Rodgers died in 1979, the Queen is a cultural icon of taste and sophistication.  She  would never stoop to listening to, much less having songs from hackneyed musicals [performed during some sort of formal summit](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E6D6143EF936A15752C1A9629C8B63).  Outrageous . . . but not the worst of the Obamateurisms the world witnessed today:

He is a complete idiot, but OMG did you see Michelle’s arms?

She’s actually quite petit and feminine, for a sasquatch.

At least Lady MacBeth had the decency to cover up those ham-slabs she calls arms when going to meet the Queen. Too bad it looked like a cat spit up on her head, though.

Michelle is a monster, the Isle of Man could fit under that tent!

She walks like a baboon. And she’s obviously packing on the pounds.

MSM, stop comparing MO with Jackie Kennedy. It makes you look silly. Jackie was about as big around as one of MO’s thighs.

Horrible outfit on our First Wookie.

As my British mother-in-law would say, “What common people.”

Set aside, for the moment, the fact that the people who bemoan the Obamas’ ostensible classlessness mock his wife with all the maturity of [the kids who mistakenly thought they ran with the popular crowd](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/im-moving-to-the-country.html), because I’ve not yet revealed the most horrifying Obamateurism of the day.  It seems the fairer Obama may have slighted Prince Philip in some small manner of decorum.  Under normal circumstances, that would not have been alright, but . . .

They started wars over less in history.

They have!  And to have slighted, of all people, _Prince Philip_, why I’m almost embarrassed to call Obama my Presi—wait, that wouldn’t be acclaimed the [dontopedalogist](http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/dontopedalogy\_1/) would it?  _Really_?  _Give me a fuc_—on second thought, take it away Eddie:

No links to avoid automatic link-backs.  But all of the above can be found at m/iche/lle m/alk/in and h/ot a/ir.  There was also a lot of material about how noble and gentle Prince Philip was in bearing and demeanor, but I’d depleted my irony reserves at that point and couldn’t do much with it.

According to the Guardian, Philip asked the Obamas [how to tell the various G20 leaders apart](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/02/g20-monarchy). I don’t think we need to worry over-much about _his_ being offended.

Prince Philip is teh MAN… Honestly, a German Greek who thinks foreigners are funny; you can’t pay for irony like that.

I can understand their concern. With the Rodgers and Hammerstein ipod, the Obamas have manifestly failed to match Gerald Ford’s standard during the bicentennial when he treated the Queen to Captain and Tennille’s aesthetically unparalleled “Muskrat Love.” Clearly the consequences of postmodern polluting of the canon.

I seem to remember that last year a lot of us (i.e. commenters on progressive blogs) were cheerily looking forward to wingnuts’ heads esploding if Obama won.

Well he did and, predictably, they are.

Somehow it’s less fun than I had hoped. Their racism continues to be more disturbing than amusing.

I’m mostly bewildered at the faux-prudish stance they seem to be adopting.  Bare arms! I thought I saw a _shoulder_!

(The racism, unfortunately, isn’t all that surprising.  holy crap, Michelle Obama is _black_?)

I agree with Ben.  Somehow, it’s more noxious to me when they start talking about physical appearance.  These comments make me want to throw up.

long time lurker and American living in the UK, when I met Prince Philip he accused me of embezzlement. And I was in no means the worst insulted in that brief stop on his tour that day.

Are you an embezzler?

Well that’s hardly the point, is it, ben? I mean, certain things simply aren’t _said_.

_the Queen is a cultural icon of taste and sophistication_

I know this post is dated 1 April, but that’s just too silly, as any fule do know who’s seen Lizzie’s taste in (1) frocks and (2) dogs.

Over here in the UK the meeting has been reported as being marred by Prince Philip’s gaffes in speaking to the Obamas, rather than the reverse.  Everything I’ve seen about the ‘social’ aspects of their various meetings has been complimentary towards them.  British mothers-in-law are more likely to be saying ‘what lovely people’ as far as I can tell.

Yeah, I agree with Iain. The British press coverage is along the lines of “The Obamas are so enticing the Queen just can’t help but break protocol by touching them!” Of course, that same story here is, “OMG Michelle O. broke protocol and touched the Queen!”

I hope the Queens’ iPod included songs by Rodgers and Hart as well.

I work for  a lottery distributor. We give money away to good causes.  

“But you keep some back. I mean we would all would keep some back for ourselves.”

The visit didn’t last 30 minutes and that was not the only one insulted in that visit.

But I’d love to compare notes with Michelle on the queen who I think has the eyes of serial killer.
