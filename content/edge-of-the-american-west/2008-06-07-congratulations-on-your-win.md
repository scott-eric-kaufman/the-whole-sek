## “Congratulations on your win.”

Terry McAuliffe’s understandably paranoid.  Twelve years before earning a Pulitzer for “[for her fresh and insightful columns on the impact of President Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky](http://www.pulitzer.org/year/1999/commentary/)” — if “[I sure hope he had sex with her](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E3D9163DF937A35751C0A96E958260&scp=4&sq=maureen+dowd+lewinsky&st=nyt)” isn’t an award-worthy insight, I don’t know what is  — Maureen Dowd [savaged McAuliffe](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D61E38F934A35754C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all) in one of her first assignments as a Washington correspondent for the _Times_:

His picture was in _Life_ magazine last year after he wrestled an alligator at a Seminole festival in Florida in return for a $15,000 check for the Democrats.

[…]

Talking to a Utah Democrat, a ”slug” who is trying to ”stiff” him on $5,000, as he puts it, Mr. McAuliffe says with mock solemnity: ”You’ve only cost us the Presidency. I hope you sleep easy tonight.”

The first step in getting to talk to big-league contributors, however, is getting past their secretaries. At this, Mr. McAuliffe is an expert.

”Jenny,” the bachelor fund-raiser croons, ”this is Terry McAuliffe, the love of your life.”

”Mary,” he coos, ”it’s your main man, the Macker. Got any wild dates this weekend?”

On the phone with a secretary he has never talked to before named Larna, he murmurs, ”Just think of it, you and me, together on the inaugural stand, waving.” Then he turns to an assistant and says: ”Send Larna some ‘Gephardt for President’ pens and get her on the Christmas card list.”

She also makes Mr. McAuliffe’s valentine list. Every year, he sends out 500 drugstore valentines to secretaries and millionaires, pals and colleagues in the fund-raising business, like the elegant Pamela Harriman.

”No one in their right mind would send Pamela Harriman a card with a squirrel that says ‘I’m nutty for you,’ ” sighs Alecia Dyer, Mr. McAuliffe’s secretary since he was 23 — a ”baby,” as she puts it.

When _that_ is your first taste of the national spotlight, and it’s followed by fund-raising for the second Clinton-Gore presidency, I can understand why you wouldn’t trust the national press corps.  I get it, really, I do.

That _still_ doesn’t mean you should congratulate the media on its “win” after your candidate finishes a surprisingly gracious concession speech. \* If Clinton does want the VP slot — and after today’s speech, there’s little doubt she does — she’ll have no choice but to burn bridges with some of her hard-liners.

Her relationship with McAuliffe is long-standing and intensely personal.  In the aftermath of the 1994 Congressional elections, he raised $27 million for the Clinton-Gore ticket.  After Bill’s second term, he finessed her NY residency with a $1.3 loan for the Chappaqua home.  So I can’t imagine she would willingly cut ties.

But he really hasn’t left her any choice, has he?

\*I can’t find a transcript or the video, but it’s at the end of [this interview](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/06/07/mcauliffe-i-want-to-go-to-the-magic-kingdom-with-hillary/). The screen’s split between King and Blitzer, so when McAuliffe turns to King and says “Congratulations on your win,” you’re treated to two reaction shots.  I know what you’re thinking — “I’m not hearing about this anywhere else, so why would I trust the deaf guy’s ears?” — but this deaf guy watches television with the captions on. Of course, the caption suggested McAuliffe congratulated King on his “wind,” but given the [rank creepiness of McAullife’s media-animosity](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=171030&title=terry-mcauliffe), I’m pretty sure he said “win.”

I’m curious what from the speech makes you quasi-certain she wants the VP slot, SEK.

I was listening to it from the next room, while doing other things, so I must’ve missed something.

Blitzer and Olbermann and King all said so.  It must be true.

But seriously, the tone of the speech — most notably, her attempt to rile up the audience with Obama’s “Yes! We! Can!” — went far beyond conciliatory.  His words kept coming out of her mouth in what seemed to me a deliberate attempt to communicate to him and his staff that she’s 1) comfortable with his message and 2) communicates it ably.

Didn’t they spend an hour together in Feinstein’s house?  She must practically know by now whether or not she is the VP candidate.

_went far beyond conciliatory_

See, I’m not so sure that has anything to do with being the veep.  

Given the very hard feelings among many of her supporters, and the lines Clinton herself crossed during her campaign, I think she had to go “beyond conciliatory” just to start the reconciliation.  After the hold-out-to-the-last-person tone of her speech after the last primary, and the reaction of some of her supporters at the RBC meeting, she needed to send a _clear_ signal that she really was done and she really did want her supporters to come together behind Obama.

OTOH, far be it from me to contradict Larry King and his apparently remarkable wind.

Ms. Dowd is a Pulitzer laureate?  That makes me respect the honor a little less from now on.

_Didn’t they spend an hour together in Feinstein’s house? She must practically know by now whether or not she is the VP candidate._

I read your pronoun weird because Feinstein’s about to come on _Late Edition_ to answer the question of what Clinton and Obama talked about.  Made me think you meant “Feinstein bugged the room/had her ear on a glass to the door/&c.”  (BREAKING NEWS: The two were there alone, Feinstein claims, with only one staffer each in the study with them.  New standard for “alone” established by the California Senator!)

That said, I’m sure Clinton knows the conditions under which he’d accept her as a VP, which is why I think the speech was full of code words aimed at him.

_After the hold-out-to-the-last-person tone of her speech after the last primary, and the reaction of some of her supporters at the RBC meeting, she needed to send a clear signal that she really was done and she really did want her supporters to come together behind Obama._

Agreed, but as I said above, I think he listed the conditions under which he’d take her on as VP and I don’t doubt she tried to meet them in that speech.  Yes, she had to overreach to do so, but I don’t think she’d have caved to the overreaching if she wouldn’t be considered for the slot.  

Alright, not really “the” slot, more “a” slot, as she might be angling for a cabinet position.

_OTOH, far be it from me to contradict Larry King and his apparently remarkable wind._

Sorry, it was _John_, not _Larry_ King who was on the floor with McAuliffe.  

_Ms. Dowd is a Pulitzer laureate? That makes me respect the honor a little less from now on._

To be honest, the award for “distinguished commentary” varies more from year-to-year than any other Pulitzer.  I’m not sure what the committee’s rules are regarding it, but any award Dave Barry, Charles Krauthammer, Anna Quindlen and Jim Murray can win is a _wee_ schizophrenic.

Maybe this is where our real disagreement lies.  Short of a divorce, I don’t think there are any “conditions under which he’d take her on as VP.”

I have no idea what Obama will do about the veep slot (though I trust him to make a good decision, regardless).  But Scott’s right:  Clinton’s endorsement was an audition to be Obama’s running mate.  It was also an audition, I’d guess, for the rest of her career.  And it was a great speech.
