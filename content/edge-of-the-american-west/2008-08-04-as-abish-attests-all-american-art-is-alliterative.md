## As Abish attests, all American art is alliterative

Not really, of course.  Only if [it’s postmodern](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811205339/diesekoschmar-20) or [romantic](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=MeZPVaSa8lIC&dq=%!t(MISSING)he+real+america+in+romance%!&(MISSING)printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=rTzLqkxqTc&sig=4\_06CbG2cSLoOFuQcsX5AhSXDh8&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPR8,M1), and today it’s romantic.  Edwin Markham’s _The Real America in Romance_ (1909) sought to blend “authentic history and romance … to their mutual advantage.”  His rationale:

Here are set before us the examples of great men of earth, men great in their patriotism and self-sacrifice; and side by side with them are romantic characters typical of the times, men and women only less great in their kindliness and unselfishness, all affording a high expression of the art of Anglo-Saxon romance. Instead of reading about historical characters and events, we see the persons themselves in action, and live with them through the events of their day and generation. The reader loses himself in the irresistible fascination of the story, and the impressions resulting are made on the heart as well as on the intellect.

You do not merely read about Columbus: you endure with him his hardships, share with him his disappointments, rejoice with him in his achievements. You actually feel the thrill of discovery when the New World swims into his vision. Not content with telling you merely that Washington wintered and suffered at Valley Forge with his army, the author takes you straightway into the camp, shows you the torn and bleeding feet of the soldiers, and makes you stand watch with the half-fed sentries, with little to warm your blood except a fiery determination to die of cold, hunger, or British bullets, rather than give up the fight for your country.

That’s a single paragraph in the original, but I’ve sliced it up 1) [because it’s overlong](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/on\_paragraph\_le.html), and 2) to emphasize a rhetorical shift from “the reader” to “you.”  What opens as a theory of literary affect quickly pivots into admonishment — the reader who doesn’t endure, share, rejoice, winter, suffer or stand watch isn’t merely a bad reader but unpatriotic.  “If you have fail to empathize with those who fought ‘for _your_ country,'” Markham as much as says, “you’re a terrible American.”  He never considers a reader might withhold sympathy not because he or she possesses a paucity of patriotism, but because his bathetic prose betrays an ear unworthy of enthused encomium.  Consider the [first sentence of Volume IX, _The Stars & Stripes_](http://books.google.com/books?id=WWA-yFBCy7EC&pg=PA7&lpg=PP1&ots=VybmAwrKCX&dq=markham+stars+and+stripes&sig=ACfU3U1J7c7Y8APm5EzwMswiI45zVCUENg#PPA19,M1):

A band of boys was abroad in the streets of Boston.

But Scott, you say, happy accidents have happened heretofore!  Granted.  Now consider the first two sentences of the second paragraph:

But it was not mirth nor mischief that brought them forth to throng the streets.  So much might have been inferred from their eager and excited talk as they hurried over the flagging, covered thinly with snow.

Those alliterative pairs — “mirth nor mischief” and “eager and excited” — bespeak a deliberately alliterative aesthetic agenda.  _Still_ don’t believe me?  Turn to the twenty-first page and proceed to ponder this passage:

Then the people, or such of them as did not feel the restraint of the more orderly element, rose in riot.  The answer to the riot came in the shape of red-coated soldiers, two regiments of them, under Colonel Dalrymple; and the appointment of hated Hutchinson, Tory townsman, as lieutenant-governor.  […]  Now the tension of nearly two years had been drawn taut within three days, and peace thus strained had snapped.

The last phrase — “peace thus strained had snapped” — demonstrates why authors aim alliterative for effect.  (My last sentence, not so much.)  It is, in fact, a rather awesome example of alliterative effect: the initial “s” links both words, but the long diphthong of “strain” enacts a straining snapped by the short monothong of “snapped.”  However, since Markham’s every sentence subsists on said diet, this felicitous phrase fails to find favor.

The reader turned off by Markham’s abusive alliteration isn’t unpatriotic _per se_, merely in possession of refinement and taste.  But if the above hasn’t convinced you of Markham’s “talent,” try this:

With a whoop, the band broke toward the sentinel.

“Kill him!” they cried.  “Kill the bloody-backed scoundrel!”

They fell to pelting him with snowballs.

“The lobster is going to fire!” cried the lads, pressing closer.

What happens when you pelt lobsters with snowballs?  Death or [_Fafblog_](http://fafblog.blogspot.com/).

My students understand this problem better when I call it “Peter Piper Syndrome.” I suppose I should make the name alliterative, too, but then I’d get irritated saying it.

_Death or Fafblog._

Is the key phrase here “Anglo-Saxon”?  Not that I’ve read much of that, but I gather A-S poetry is supposed to have been built on this sort of thing.  More directly, I suspect the influence of the libretti of Wagner

As Scott knows full well, alliterative poetry has [a long history](http://acephalous.typepad.com/book1.2.jpg) in A-S literature.  Or at least it goes back a ways; the history might be short.

Scott knows that, but didn’t connect those dots until Vance pointed it out.  I’m sketchy on Markham generally — and sketchier still on the nature of his editorial work on this series, much of which he wrote himself, but without indicating anywhere what was his, what he revised, and what he commissioned — so it’d be difficult to nail down.  John R. Musick is sometimes listed as sole author, but all the contemporary views champion Markham’s editorial work, and given his now-faded reputation as one of the premier American poets of the early 20th Century, he might’ve been little more than a brand or imprimatur.  

Back on point, though, I wonder if I can’t connect this reverence of Anglo-Saxon culture with the early rumblings of the eugenic movement — esp. as Markham corresponded with Jack London (whose complete letters are, maddeningly, on my desk in California while I’m here, quite possibly to be hurricane-trapped, in Texas).

Right, that’s where I was heading with the Wagner reference.  There must be a history of the attempts to revive medieval styles — surely there must have been Ossians and Chattertons in German too, before Wagner, etc.

And all this time I’d heard it as “zug-zug.” Wait–maybe they’re synonyms.

Hee.

_I can’t connect this reverence of Anglo-Saxon culture with the early rumblings of the eugenic movement_

There’s an older tradition wherein the Anglo-Saxons had conceived of an ancient liberty in the forests or something, which was then lost under the English monarchs and then recovered by the American patriots. There are Jefferson letters where he advocates teaching, in addition to classical works, Anglo-Saxon stuff because of the heritage of liberty (or something like that). I don’t know what happened to that part of the Jefferson legacy.

Wow, sure enough.

Thomas Jefferson … proclaimed to John Adams in 1776 that the Americans were “the children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night; and on the other side, Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs from whom we claim the honour of being descended, and whose political principles and form of government we have assumed.

Reginald Horsman, _Race and Manifest Destiny: The Origins of American Racial Anglo-Saxonism_, 1981.  Cited in [this paper](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/polsoc/staff/academic/eric-kaufmann/wasp-reconsidered) by one Eric Kaufmann.

Scott, how do you ever get to the end of such a garden of forking paths?

[Report](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/JefRock.html) of the Commissioners for the University of Virginia August 4, 1818 (440-1):

The considerations which have governed the specification of languages to be taught by the professor of modern languages were, that the French is the language of general intercourse among nations, and as a depository of human science, is unsurpassed by any other language, living or dead; that the Spanish is highly interesting to us, as the language spoken by so great a portion of the inhabitants of our continents, with whom we shall probably have great intercourse ere long, and is that also in which is written the greater part of the earlier history of America. The Italian abounds with works of very superior order, valuable for their matter, and still more distinguished as models of the finest taste in style and composition. And the German now stands in a line with that of the most learned nations in richness of erudition and advance in the sciences. It is too of common descent with the language of our own country, a branch of the same original Gothic stock, and furnishes valuable illustrations for us.

[artifical paragraph break]

But in this point of view, the Anglo-Saxon is of peculiar value. We have placed it among the modern languages, because it is in fact that which we speak, in the earliest form in which we have knowledge of it. It has been undergoing, with time, those gradual changes which all languages, ancient and modern, have experienced; and even now needs only to be printed in the modern character and orthography to be intelligible, in a considerable degree, to an English reader. It has this value, too, above the Greek and Latin, that while it gives the radix of the mass of our language, they explain its innovations only. Obvious proofs of this have been presented to the modern reader in the disquisitions of Horn Tooke; and Fortescue Aland has well explained the great instruction which may be derived from it to a full understanding of our ancient common law, on which, as a stock, our whole system of law is engrafted. It will form the first link in the chain of an historical review of our language through all its successive changes to the present day, will constitute the foundation of that critical instruction in it which ought to be found in a seminary of general learning, and thus reward amply the few weeks of attention which would alone be requisite for its attainment; a language already fraught with all the eminent science of our parent country, the future vehicle of whatever we may ourselves achieve, and destined to occupy so much space on the globe, claims distinguished attention in American education.

And here is what I was thinking of:

[Jefferson to John Cartwright](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=276&division=div1), 5 June 1824:

DEAR AND VENERABLE SIR, — I am much indebted for your kind letter of February the 29th, and for your valuable volume on the English constitution. I have read this with pleasure and much approbation, and think it has deduced the constitution of the English nation from its rightful root, the Anglo-Saxon… [long letter follows]

It seems that the Glorious Revolution first recovered the ancient liberties, then the American Revolution helped them along.

**herbert browne**

					

		

So, it’s to Hengist & Horsa that I owe a debt of gratitude for the radix of the priceless prose “Ginger Joe, with a roar of rage, lifted his pistol and fired.” (from the illustrated cover of “Secret Service” nickel pulp no.284, from July 1, 1904, heralding the adventures of Old & Young King Brady, detectives: “The Bradys in Sunflower City; or After ‘Bad’ man Brown”, by A New-York Detective)… and not to Robert Service. Ah, well, then… ^..^

Christ, people, you’re too good for me.  You know what I need?  A research assistant I can safely blame for plagiarism.  (Much as I’d like to appropriate this Eric Kaufman’s work, the names are so close as to cause suspicion: “Why’d you drop your ‘n’ and go by ‘Scott’ instead of ‘Eric,'” they’d ask.)

That said, I think andrew just earned him an acknowledgment in a dissertation no one’ll ever read.  Congratulations!  (But seriously, thanks.  Soon as this hurricane blows in and by, I’ll follow your line up.)
