[Irony is delicious](http://patterico.com/2008/09/10/nyt-story-mentioning-obama-ayers-and-chicago-annenberg-challenge-all-lost-in-a-sea-of-lipstick-coverage/).  WLS is upset because one manufactured   scandal drowned out the _The New York Times_‘s coverage of the most   important [unreported](http://patterico.com/2008/08/25/bill-ayers-friends/) [story](http://patterico.com/2008/09/09/quote-of-the-day-bill-ayers/) ever.  If [you’re](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13178) [of the](http://globallabor.blogspot.com/) [opinion](http://patterico.com/2008/08/21/a-very-interesting-and-potentially-devastating-story-about-obama-and-terrorist-bill-ayers-is-beginning-to-percolate/) that the McCain campaign is overstuffed   with tactical geniuses dedicated to sitting on the sordid tale of the   Annenberg Challenge until closer to the election, listen up, because I’m   about to tell a story.


It begins, as Tom Maguire [writes](http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/obama-ayers-and-the-annenberg-challenge-cover-up/2/), “[a]t a White   House event with Bill Clinton [where] philanthropist Walter Annenberg announced that he was making a $500 million grant to cities across the nation to put towards public school reform.”  The intrigue and perfidy originate, as does everything currently wrong with the country, with Bill Clinton and a leftist billionaire cast in the Soros mold.  Bill Ayers, former WU terrorist and Annenberg’s brother-in-ideology, requested and received $50 million for urban enrichment programs which would, in accordance with the core beliefs of all involved, function as [leftist indoctrination camps](http://patterico.com/2008/09/10/nyt-story-mentioning-obama-ayers-and-chicago-annenberg-challenge-all-lost-in-a-sea-of-lipstick-coverage/).  While much is known and   reviled about Ayers and his personal choice to chair the Chicago Annenberg   Challenge’s board, Barack Obama, relatively little attention has been paid to their benefactor—the man who personally approved Ayers’s $150 million plan to put the _Che_ back in _Chicago_—Walter Annenberg.

Annenberg arrived on the national scene when he and his father, Philadelphia publisher Moses “Moe” Annenberg, were charged with evading $3,258,809 in income taxes.  Although based in Philadelphia, the Annenberg clan’s ties with the Chicago political machine were already well-established: his co-defendants included “James M. Ragen Sr., Chicago, former general manager of Nation-wide News Service, Inc.; James M. Ragen Jr., Chicago, son of the Nation-wide general manager; Charles W. Bidwill,   Chicago, head of a printing company and owner of the Chicago Cardinals, professional football club; [and] Herbert S. Kamin, Chicago.”[[1]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#1)

His father was successfully prosecuted, but Walter avoided jail-time.  He spent the better part of the next decade in a   manner befitting a billionaire wastrel: rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood elite.[[2]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#2) When he assumed control of his father’s publishing empire after Moses’s death in 1952, Annenberg used   those Hollywood connections to start a little magazine called _TV   Guide_.

Under his stewardship, Triangle Publications waged war against conservative American values from the pages of _Seventeen_ to the stages of _American Bandstand_.  As the 1952 election neared, he   hosted countless fundraisers for the first “[eggheaded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egghead)” political neophyte from Illinois whose Presidential aspirations were dashed by a   humble war hero: Adlai Stevenson.  At an exclusive Malibu Beach estate,   the _Los Angeles Times_ reported, Annenberg convened “[m]ore than   40 State and national Republican Party leaders [for] dinner with Sen.   Nixon, who flew [there] from Denver to meet with them.”[[3]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#3).

_That doesn’t sound_—never mind.  Even hard-core communist   sympathizers can have a day of clarity.  Annenberg’s solstice of sanity   ended with a winter chill.  As the end of Eisenhower’s second term neared,   the Kennedy clan courted the powerful publisher’s for support in the 1960   elections: “Vice-President and Mrs. Nixon were hosts at a small dinner   party in their Forest Lane home last night to Mr. and Mrs. Norman Chandler   and Mr. and Mrs. Otis Chandler[;] Mr. and Mrs. Walter Annenberg; [and]   British Ambassador Sir Harold Caccia.”[[4]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#4).

_Now wait one minute_—why’s the financial backer of Ayer’s   “enrichment” camps dining with Nixon and British Ambassadors on the eve of   an election?  Soviet [COINTELPRO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)? We’re talking about the man who green-lit Howard K. Smith’s 1959 hit-piece, “The Political Obiturary of Richard M. Nixon”:

[T]wo stations, WNHC-TV in New Haven and WFIL-TV in   Philadelphia . . . blacked out not only the original telecast but even a   reference to the program in a straight news report 24 hours later[.]  The   owner of the outlets, Walter Annenberg . . . could have readily added an   editorial footnote disagreeing with the program without going to the   extreme measure of total suppression.[[5]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#5)

_The fuck_?  This is the same Arab-loving Annenberg whose papers   slandered the Israelis at the outset of the [Six-Day War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day\_War), claiming   the deaths of three Israel soldiers on November 11
th
 had been   faked as a pretext to send 4,000 heavily-armed soldiers into a town of   3,000, [as-Samu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Es\_Samu), in   order to secure water for the nearby settlements of Ma’on and Asa’el.  As   M.S. Handler wrote in _The New York Times_: “Walter Annenberg,   publisher of _The Philadelphia Inquirer_, was reported by his   newspaper to have contributed $1 million.”[[6]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#6) His own   newspaper reported that he donated an inflation-adjusted **$6,928,926.20   million** to the United Jewish Appeal’s Israel Emergency Fund—_what_?

_Shut up_.  Annenberg approved Ayers’s grant application.  He hears capitalism’s death-rattle.  He thinks the New Deal proves Marx correct about socialism being a   stepping stone to capitalism.  He and his friends finance the overthrow of   the American government.  Remember Norman Chandler, Annenberg’s co-conspirator in the communist   plot to infiltrate Nixon’s dining room?  Raping the American way of life   _to death_ is the first thing he thinks about in the morning and   the last thing he thinks about night.  Like Annenberg, he hires   inexperienced college kids to run multi-billion dollar enterprises into   the ground:

Norman Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer [of   Times Mirror Co.], announced Wednesday [that] Walter H. Annenberg,   president of Triangle Publications, Inc., was elected a director of Times   Mirror at the company’s board meeting . . . Annenberg is also a director   of Campbell Soup Co., the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. and Girard Trust   Bank.[[7]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#7)

_Just hold those horses_—Obama’s an acolyte of an anti-American terrorist funded by   Annenberg.  Annenberg supports terrorism.  He’s not a close personal   friend of GOP elite.

A Nixon spokesman described [them] as the two families’   closest and most personal friends.

According to _The New York Times_ article about the plan to secure   a truce between rival factions the heathen way—_i.e._ by   exploiting the sacred bond of marriage for crass political ends—the “two families” in question   were the Husseins and al-Sauds.

Former President Eisenhower’s only grandson, Dwight David   Eisenhower, and President-elect Richard M. Nixon’s younger daughter,   Julie, were married yesterday . . .

But Annenberg wasn’t there.  He was out aiding and abetting peace-loving—

. . . at a dignified ceremony with Quaker   touches.

They were superficial!

Julie, who considers herself a Quaker, asked Dr. Peale and her   bridegroom to use the Quaker “thee” and “thou” throughout the   service.

SUPERFICIAL!  Besides, what has this got to do with the man   behind the terrorist behind Obama?

Guests included Walter Annen—

UNDER DURESS so he could experience FREEDOM first-hand!

—berg, the Philadelphia Publisher at whose—

—MARXIST INDOCTRINATION FACILITY WHERE AYERS TAUGHT OBAMA HOW TO BEHEAD AMERI—

—at whose Palm Springs, California house Mr. Nixon—

DON’T POINT THOSE CITATIONS AT ME!  ANNENBERG IS AYERS IS OBAMA!  HE IS   AN EMBODIMENT OF HATRED OF THE AMERICAN DRE—

Walter Annenberg’s 200-acre Palm Springs enclosure includes   his own 18-hole golf course.[[9]](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-obama-is-ayers-is-annenberg/#9)

HE WOULD’VE STRANGLED SAINT RONALD WITH HIS BARE HANDS IF HE HAD THE CHANCE!
