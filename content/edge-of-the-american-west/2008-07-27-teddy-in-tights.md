As the premier _Dark Knight_ poster ’round these parts, it [
has been demanded of
](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/obamawayne-2008-mccainwayne-2008/#comment-16023), er, _falls upon me to_ draw your attention to an interview with Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale in which the pair reveal their Batman is based on Edmund Morris’ [_The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375756787/diesekoschmar-20) and [_Theodore Rex_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812966007/diesekoschmar-20).\*  In the interview, Bale admits to confusion when the Nolans — brother Jonathan co-writes Christopher’s films — insisted he read _The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt_ before they began principle photography on _Batman Begins_.  Nolan then explains (and I paraphrase):

Batman’s not as unique as people think.  Grant Bob Kane’s Gotham is New York and Batman has a direct historical precedent in Theodore Roosevelt.  His father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., had been one of the city’s preeminent philanthropists — having found and funded the New York City Children’s Aid Society, the Met, and the American Museum of Natural History, to name a few of his charitable works — and died in a way Morris contends traumatized his son: suddenly, from a cancer whose existence he’d hidden, and mere hours before Theodore returned from Harvard.  In 1884, his beloved mother and wife died in the same house, on the same day.  A bereft Roosevelt set out for the Dakota Territory shortly thereafter.  He spent his time in the hinterlands learning how to be a proper police, then applied those lessons when he became president of the New York City Police Commissioners in 1895.  Like Batman, Roosevelt employed bleeding-edge technology into his crime-fighting: under his watch, telephones were installed in precincts, bicycles were deployed on beats, and various criminal identification systems, like Bertillonage, were monkeyed about with.


Nolan’s statement resonates with [many](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/03/10/mccain-on-gop-there-is-no-health-in-them-and-they-cannot-be-trusted/) [a recent]() [discussion](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/oh-for-heavens-sake/) about the Roosevelt’s legacy _vis-a-vis_ the current administration.  If [Bush-is-Batman](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/obamawayne-2008-mccainwayne-2008/) and Batman-is-Roosevelt, logic demands that middle be distributed and then it’s case closed, verdict delivered, suit settle, put a period on it already: Bush-is-as-Batman as Socrates-is-mortal.  

The which-president-is-more-[
Airwolf
](http://daveslongbox.blogspot.com/2005/09/airwolf-adjective.html)-Batman debate aside, Nolan’s decision to craft Batman’s appeal after Roosevelt’s is ridiculously savvy, inasmuch as it speaks to that most cherished (if post-dated) primal American myths: self-invention.  In _Batman Begins_, the young Bruce Wayne isn’t some spectacular physical specimen; in fact, he’s thin, fragile, and perpetually frightened.  Nolan’s direction reinforces this: he’s either in tears, bed, or the bottom of a well in every shot.  Even Bale’s adolescent Wayne, returned from school for Chill’s parole hearing, buries a wisp-thin frame beneath layers of clothes as if to prevent circumstance from buffeting his head into a doorknob.  The first act of _Batman Begins_ plays directly into the Roosevelt mystique, _i.e._ the frail boy who refines his body into a weapon.  The first film ends, then, much where Morris’ _Rise_ does: his reputation established, his name to be reckoned with, but his future uncertain.  Where does this self-made man fit in the political machine in which he’ll have to function?  What compromises must he make?  What ideals must he betray in order to act upon?  

I can’t do much in the way of answering these questions myself, as my copies of the Morris are at home, but I’d be curious to do a closer inspection of _Theodore Rex_ alongside _The Dark Knight_, if only to ask questions like “What will be Batman’s San Juan Hill?”  I’m not sure what I’m up to here, whether I’m following broad parallels between Roosevelt’s life and the Batman mythos, or more specific correspondences between Morris’ life of Roosevelt and Nolan’s films.  The former would speak more to Batman’s cultural appeal, but the latter has the virtue of being, you know, _doable_.

\*I’m not sure where I saw this interview.  A [quick search](http://www.frankmurphy.com/labels/bats.html) suggests I was watching [_Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight_](http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&episodeId=322796) on The History Channel, but that can’t be correct, as there ain’t no such beast where I’m at.

_If Bush-is-Batman and Batman-is-Roosevelt, logic demands that middle be distributed_

That depends on what the meaning of “is” is, doesn’t it?  Somehow I suspect neither one is simple equivalence.

“his beloved mother and wife died in the same house.”  

At long last, Theodore Rex is replaced by – –   Toedipus Rex. 

(Sorry)

[…] Scott Kaufman reports (without, alas, documentation) that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale based their Batman, in part, on Teddy Roosevelt. […]

Another vote for [The History Channel](http://meaningfuldistractions.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/news\_new\_batman\_historical\_identity\_revealed\_55232/) as source.  Of course, did Nolan come up with this just so the History Channel could do a documentary?

_Another vote for The History Channel as source._

That summary suggests it’s just Nolan speaking, not Nolan and Bale, so I don’t think that’s my source.  (Probably something he repeated on the junket.)  Also, he doesn’t seem to have mentioned Morris, which he did in the one I saw — they even flashed the covers of both volumes as he was talking.  

Plus, you know, only having three channels and all.  (I’m only being difficult because it sounds like whatever _Access Entertainment Hollywood Tonight Now Today_ show I saw seems to be a little more detailed.)

Batman, a megalomaniac bent on revenge who uses vigilante violence and works entirely in secret. defying the law and the citizenry if it suits his “I will save you” morality vs Bush, a bumbling nincompoop who only wishes he could do the same?

Roosevelt was a brilliant man who distinguished himself in combat, in science, in philosophy and in politics. Bush is a charlatan and colossal  screw-up who has more in common with Donald Trump than any man of genuine substance. 

This argument is a lard balloon, I think…

But is Batman just a vigilante?  A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.  But Bush, er, I mean, Batman, thinks history will justify his actions.  He didn’t invade Iraq because Saddam threatened to kill his parents, he didn’t!  I mean, really.  Nonsense, all of it.

Wait, what?
