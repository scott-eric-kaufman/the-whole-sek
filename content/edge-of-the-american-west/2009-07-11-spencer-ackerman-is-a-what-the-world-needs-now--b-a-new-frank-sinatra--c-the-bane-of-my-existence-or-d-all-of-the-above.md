## Spencer Ackerman is (a) what the world needs now, (b) a new Frank Sinatra, (c) the bane of my existence, or (d) all of the above.

It goes without saying—or _should_—that [Spencer Ackerman](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/) is a national treasure.  I never comment over there because of [one of the folks who does](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/arooga-arooga-arooga-arooga.html), but Spencer damn near tops my increasingly shorter list of essential morning reads.  That said, on those days I don’t have time to read in the mornings, I don’t—_because I can’t_—read him at all.  My brain translates this:

![attackerman](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/attackerman1.jpg?w=490 "attackerman")

Into this:

[![attackerman02](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/attackerman023.jpg?w=490 "attackerman02")](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/07/09/rip285/)

And I just can’t sleep once I’ve see that.

(_This is less of a post and more of a frank admission of admiration.  If all his peers had half his tenacity, DeLong could excise one [loathsome category](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/better\_press\_corps/) from his site._)
