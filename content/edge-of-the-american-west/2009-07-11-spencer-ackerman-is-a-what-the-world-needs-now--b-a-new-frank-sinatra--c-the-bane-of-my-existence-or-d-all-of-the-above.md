## Spencer Ackerman is (a) what the world needs now, (b) a new Frank Sinatra, (c) the bane of my existence, or (d) all of the above.

It goes without saying—or _should_—that [Spencer Ackerman](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/) is a national treasure.  I never comment over there because of [one of the folks who does](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/arooga-arooga-arooga-arooga.html), but Spencer damn near tops my increasingly shorter list of essential morning reads.  That said, on those days I don’t have time to read in the mornings, I don’t—_because I can’t_—read him at all.  My brain translates this:

![attackerman](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/attackerman1.jpg?w=490 "attackerman")

Into this:

[![attackerman02](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/attackerman023.jpg?w=490 "attackerman02")](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/07/09/rip285/)

And I just can’t sleep once I’ve see that.

(_This is less of a post and more of a frank admission of admiration.  If all his peers had half his tenacity, DeLong could excise one [loathsome category](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/better\_press\_corps/) from his site._)

Really?  They look fine on my end in both IE and Firefox.  There’s only supposed to be a link in the second one (in case people who don’t read Spencer don’t know what that post title signifies).

All better now (indeed, soon after I posted). While I don’t love Spencer’s love for music lyrics as titles, I honor his honoring the dead (and don’t mind seeing those posts pile up in my Reader).

Forgot how good that song is until just this moment. Oh, there was content, too? Bonus!

I appreciate the link to Ackerman… esp for his examination of the report on the PSP. So, thanks… (& we must all face the music…)  ^..^
