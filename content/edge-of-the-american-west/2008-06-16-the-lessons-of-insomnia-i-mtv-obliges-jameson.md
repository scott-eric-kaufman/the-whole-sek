(_Being the first in what I pray will not be a series, as I like my sanity and would prefer to keep it intact._)

_[The Real World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Real\_World)_ holds the dubious honor of being first in the post-1990 tsunami of reality television.  The premise was simple: seven strangers were picked to live in a house &c. &c. &c. and start being real.  The show never tried to live up to its name.  Canny viewers could watch the manufactured controversies being produced in the booth weeks before hostilities spontaneously erupted.  

But!

The pretense of the show was that it was unscripted and unrehearsed.  It was not some sitcom filmed in a West Hollywood back-lot in which a middle-class family dealt with generic adolescent, senescent, menopausal and mid-life crises to the pitch-corrected laughter of the ideal studio audience.  It was _real_.  

So you can imagine my surprise when I flipped on the [latest installment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Real\_World:\_Hollywood) of _The Real World_ and discovered it was being [filmed in a West Hollywood back-lot](http://www.realworldhouses.com/realworld20.html).  In a move forever granting Fredric Jameson the right to claim [he told us so](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0822310902/diesekoschmar-20), _The Real World: Hollywood_ is filmed in the same building in which CBS once shot _I Love Lucy._ 

Should we tell him this?  What are the odds [he watches _The Real World_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/sleep-is-for-th.html)?  It’s not like [he even values empirical verification](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/positivism\_vs\_materialism/).

I agree with the reading that says he is restating Hunter, rather than his own view, in the bit against empiricism.

In any case, excellent catch on The Real World.

God, this is awesome.  I find it’s a bit of a downer when it becomes obvious that I’m trapped in a simulacrum.  But such is life.

Seeing “Insomnia,” “MTV,” and “Jameson” in the same post title, I thought you were talking about a completely different [Jameson](http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/).

Seeing “insomnia,” “MTV,” and “Jameson” in your comment, I thought you’d be chiding me for alluding to a completely different [Jameson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna\_Jameson).

(That said, part of the reason for the insomnia is that I no longer talk about, around, or imbibe your Jameson, since being a stereotypical grad student for as long as I have makes me a candidate for cirrhosis of all cirrhotic.)

Ha.  I didn’t even think about her.

When I was a stereotypical grad student, we couldn’t afford to imbibe anything as nice as Jameson.  I feel ya, though.  _extends fist for bumpy thing all the kids do these days_

My insomnia, btw, is of [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed\_sleep\_phase\_syndrome) variety and doesn’t go away.

I have no idea how that duplicated.  I reject and denounce the notion that I posted it twice.

This is indeed awesome.  But tangentially,

_In a move_

Are you after all really a journalist at heart?  This headline usage of “in” is the vaguest preposition we have, little more than an equals sign.  And “move” is pretty vague this way too, but it’s characteristic of your field too, not just journalism.  (The trick is to translate it into something more idiomatic: perhaps in this case just cut right to “Forever”.)

This is the best this day in history I’ve read this week.

**PorJ**

Its “unscripted drama” – not “reality television” according to Mark Burnett, the genius behind “Survivor.”  And there is a history of it long before the _Real World_ sullied the airwaves and forever marred the genre….

Indeed, who can forget the first wave of reality programs?  “That’s Incredible!” and “Real People” brought such joy to an anxious and frightened American populace during the nightmare of the Carter Administration.   Remember how our impoverished citizenry found temporary solace in the amazing feats of Yogi Kudu, who could fold his body into a small box for the duration of a program, or that other Yogi – you know, the one who could hold his breath for 15 minutes?  Who cared about high gas prices, or inflation, with such wonderful programming available….

That’s what America needs.  More Yogis (Yogies?).

**[MW](http://www.margaretweigel.com)**

I’m a lurker here, but I am poking my little groundhog-like snout out from my anonymous burrow to say that I remember “That’s Incredible!” and I’m trying to remember the name of a network show that pitted the residents of different American towns against each other in different games of low-level dexterity. Mid-70s… anyone?  anyone?  Bueller?  I was @ 10 at the time and I think this small-town Olympiad was held at night.  

Does “Candid Camera” count as well? Not quite scripted, not quite game show shenanigans.

_This is the best this day in history I’ve read this week._

Har har.

_Are you after all really a journalist at heart?_

I just teach them in my classrooms.  That said, I was probably just thinking like one because I’d just finished drafting something about civil war breaking out in Virtual Iraq.

_And there is a history of it long before the Real World sullied the airwaves and forever marred the genre…_

Hence, the **post-1990** tsunami of reality television.

At least Lucy and Ricky didn’t stare into the camera and drone on about how it was so unfair that they had to share an apartment with Fred and Ethel.

Hey you know what? I saw Fred Mertz last night, chasing after Charlie Chaplin in _Monsieur Verdoux_.
