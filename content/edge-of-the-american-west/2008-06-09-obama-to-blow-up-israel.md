## Obama to blow up Israel

Ari and I are already humming “Hatikvah,” while Eric’s in the corner being racist.\* But seriously, when I [read](http://patterico.com/2008/06/08/obama-sites-anti-semitic-material-much-ado-about-nothing/) that a [Ron Paul supporter](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2008/06/obama\_the\_jewish\_lobby\_and\_the\_perils\_of\_web\_20/) was cross-posting [anti-semitic material](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/30241\_At\_the\_Official\_Obama\_Site-\_How\_the\_Jewish\_Lobby\_Works) to Obama’s social networking site, I reacted as anyone who had just watched him deliver a speech before AIPAC, _i.e._ l thought things like:

There’s something deeply wrong with a presidential candidate who attracts so many of these hateful psychotics.

Don’t let the fact that Charles Johnson — a man who doesn’t run a site hateful psychotics find attractive — wrote those words fool you.\*\*  It may _seem_ like the Obama’s anyone-can-contribute-a-post community embraces antisemitism, socialism, Marxism, and [poetry of questionable provenance](http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:EHuevx9YUz0J:my.barackobama.com/page/community/person/gGJnnM+site:http://my.barackobama.com+%!n(MISSING)ew+age%!&(MISSING)hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us&lr=lang\_en&client=firefox-a), but it’s only _because_ _it does_.  [Once](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/06/08/creepy-antisemitism-caught-on-the-mybarackobama-site-and-quickly-scrubbed/#comment-343966) [Obama](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/06/08/creepy-antisemitism-caught-on-the-mybarackobama-site-and-quickly-scrubbed/#comment-343997)‘s [in power](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/06/08/creepy-antisemitism-caught-on-the-mybarackobama-site-and-quickly-scrubbed/#comment-344010), Ari and I will be whistling the Israeli national anthem from a [cushy relocation camp](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0895260514/diesekoschmar-20).\*\*\*

\*Did you know the melody of “Hatikvah” is based on a Romanian folk-song called “Carriage with Oxen”?  I didn’t.  But it’s appropriate.  In my ancestral bones, I hear the kvetching: “What you want horse for?  [To pull carriage](http://www.equestrianwales.org.uk/images/Carriage%!D(MISSING)rive,%!L(MISSING)asswade%!j(MISSING)pg)?  Who are you to want being pulled by horses?  What’s good for plow is good for prom.”\*\*\*\*

\*\*Ari and Eric invited me to contribute because I 
troll
 observe, anthropologically, conservative sites.

\*\*\*I’ve already requested I be 
imprisoned
 vacationed in [Happy Camp Canyon](http://www.lamountains.com/parks.asp?parkid=18).

\*\*\*\*I know what you’re thinking: Scott, shouldn’t there be a space between your footnotes?  _I know_.  But all the HTML in the world won’t put one there, so there won’t be one.\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*Yes, one of the conditions of my posting privileges is, and I quote, “Be it said that each post contain no fewer than five footnotes, one of which must originate within another footnote like the incestuous spawn of a digressive mind.”  That said, they’re dangerously addictive.

\*\*\*\*\*Yes, one of the conditions of my posting privileges is, and I quote, “Be it said that each post contain no fewer than five footnotes, one of which must originate within another footnote like the incestuous spawn of a digressive mind.”

Is this homage to [Ari](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/01/24/national-histories/) or to [Daniel Davies](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/05/10/in-praise-of-budweiser-contains-extended-footnotes/)? or some other?\* 

\*Boy I hope all this HTML crap works.

But as you say, yes, indeed.
