## You thought I was going to mock the title, didn’t you?

Via [_Savage Minds_](http://savageminds.org/2009/03/10/winner-of-the-worst-postmodern-article-title-award/), I came across this article from the July 2008 edition of _Qualitative Inquiry_:

I know everyone wants to cry Sokal and loose the hounds of sense, but the title is what the title is.  I’m more curious about this:

I was fortunate to be mentored by Corrine Glesne, an absolutely wonderful ethnographer (Busier et al., 1997; Glesne, 1989, 1998, 2003; Martin & Glesne, 2002).

Do my eyes deceive me, or are those citations meant to substantiate _the absolute wonderfulness of Corrine Glesne_?  Is this a cheap scheme to up the number of times people are cited in professional indexes?  If so, how is it nobody’s—_wait a minute_.  I just had an idea.

Have I ever told you how awesome you are?  I haven’t?  Well then, it’s about time that I did.  It is my _professional_ opinion that you are awesome.  By the authority invested in me by the University of California, I hereby declare that each and every one of you possess more awesomeness than anyone has any right to.  You can quote me on that.  In fact, I insist that you do.  Every time you appeal to your academic ethos, I’d like to see some variation of “Lest you doubt my authority, remember that reputable scholars have attested to my awesomeness (Kaufman 2009).” Feel free to practice in the comments.

For obvious reasons, I will x-post this everywhere.  The more citations I score, the more reputable I become; and the more reputable I become, the more my stamp of approval’s worth.  I think we have ourselves a win-win scenario here.  So what are you waiting for?  Start practicing already!
