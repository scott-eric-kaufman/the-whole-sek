I know the consensus is not to link to Amazon, but this is a public service announcement: today only, [all five seasons of the best show in the history of television can be purchased for $82](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001FA1P1W/diesekoschmar-20).

As of tomorrow, industry insiders tell me, everyone must be like the schmucks who dropped [$50 _per season_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ERXC2/diesekoschmar-20) to date and now contemplate buying the fifth season at the inflated rate because it’s $32 cheaper than the boxed set.

(_So I feel like less of a shill: there are shills and then there are [hilarious dissections of the most sublime shill ever](http://joeposnanski.com/JoeBlog/2009/01/07/snuggies/).  That is all._)
