## Public Service Announcement for people who do not yet share our pop culture obsessions

I know the consensus is not to link to Amazon, but this is a public service announcement: today only, [all five seasons of the best show in the history of television can be purchased for $82](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001FA1P1W/diesekoschmar-20).

As of tomorrow, industry insiders tell me, everyone must be like the schmucks who dropped [$50 _per season_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ERXC2/diesekoschmar-20) to date and now contemplate buying the fifth season at the inflated rate because it’s $32 cheaper than the boxed set.

(_So I feel like less of a shill: there are shills and then there are [hilarious dissections of the most sublime shill ever](http://joeposnanski.com/JoeBlog/2009/01/07/snuggies/).  That is all._)

Whatever you have to pay for it – pay it.

I did not watch the series as it played out.  I randomly YouTubed onto [the scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQbsnSVM1zM) in which McNulty and Bunk solve a murder using only variations of the word “fuck,” and decided that I would check out the pilot on iTunes.  I have no idea what it cost me, but within maybe 2 or 3 weeks, I had purchased and watched all five seasons.  

While I am sure that there is noteworthy competition, I would absolutely agree with you – finest television series ever, front to end was just wonderful -writing, acting, production, musical selections – everything was just great, great great, excellent.

I felt a little like a corporate shill writing this—Amazon sent me an email!  Amazon thinks I should tell people about this sale!  I must tell people about this sale!—but this is a product I can stand behind.  I believe in this product.  Every household needs this product.  A house is not a home without one of this product.

blume:  how many of these 5-season boxes do you need?  because, just as an informational warning, every couple married in the mid-1980’s received a minimum of three (3) fondue pots, just because they once had a good time eating fondue.  think about it.

on the other hand, neither ebay nor craigslist existed at the time, so we all had to resort to regifting.  which might account for the high rate of fondue pottage going on.

At least you could use three fondue pots at once. (Cheese, meat, and chocolate fondue!) I guess we could watch The Wire on both of our computers at the same time, but it seems that you could also just watch different DVDs from the same box set at the same time. No multiples needed.

_I love the Wire, but recently finished the German Heimat series, which I think beats the Wire for the “best TV show ever” prize._

You’ve piqued my curiosity.

_This is just one in a long list of shows I’ve never watched a second of for fear that it will further distract me._

What you should really fear is that once you watch it, all other television seems inadequate.  (Because it is.)

Here’s the Amazon link.  The potted description gets things pretty much right.  Less fun than the Wire, and some things are lost in translation, but more beautiful:

More beautiful than The Wire is not a very high bar to clear, is it?

**Robert Halford**

					

		

I dunno.  I thought parts of the Wire were very beautiful indeed, in a “glimmers of light against the darkness” kind of way, e.g., Naimond’s story, the moment at the end of Season 3 when McNulty realizes he wants to go back to being a street cop, and others.  Obviously not kittens and rainbows beautiful, though.

**ari**

					

		

Fair enough.  I somehow thought you mean visually beautiful.  And although The Wire was well shot, and certainly captured the feel of urban landscapes better than most shows I can think of, I hardly ever considered it lovely.  But beauty has deeper meanings, which I see now was what you meant.

I disagree, the best show ever was definitely Homicide Life on the Street; and as such I have not watched tv since; thus making me the centre of my very own small sub-cultural niche – where I never listen and am never wrong. 

The writer of this “new tv show” is obviously less talented than the writer of THE show.

Don’t bother retorting.

Seriously, I just bought this because I’m incapable of passing up such a bargain, even though I have never watched the show and really don’t believe in being committed to TV and only have a vague idea that I might be able to gift it. And made it even cheaper by signing up for the Amazon rewards card. I think I’ve just had an evening of bad judgment. 

I’m going to blame it on SEK being a shill. Or possibly on not really wanting to prepare for class.

I couldn’t make it past somewhere in the third season of _Homicide_. I might try to pick it up again some time when I can watch more episodes in a row close together.

I agree that _Homicide_ was gorgeous TV; as good as it gets in terms of story and ensemble.  I’d believe that _The Wire_  is also gorgeous TV, but can we stop with the “best ever” stuff?  It’s so undignified, so low, so wrong.  There has been quite a bit of perfect TV– &lt;The Prisoner_,_ _Ernie Kovaks_, some amount of _Seinfeld_, and others.  But it is ridiculous to compare those things which are best appreciated for what they are and what they individually represent as if there were some galactic competition.  There is no one best thing unless one narrows oneself and what one can accept to an unacceptable degree; I mean, when the muppets did Citizen Kane, it was perfect.  What more can one ask?  The muppets in Baltimore, I guess.

Homicide _was indeed awesome._

The first few seasons of _Homicide_ were awesome.  It really went off the rails at the end (particularly what they did to Tim Bayliss).  I think Melissa Leo leaving the show pretty much marked the end of the good _Homicide_.

I’ve only watched the first season of The Wire so far, and based on that, I’d say it’s probably the best recent TV show. But for me, it still doesn’t compare to the early Homicide. 

And besides, the best TV show of all time is Blackadder.

Yes, _Homicide_ was awesome.

But what many of you don’t seem to realize is that _Homicide_ was David Simon’s first try at television, and he was hemmed in by the network constraints at NBC.

_The Wire_ is by … David Simon.  Same creator, a lot of the same writers, but airing on HBO, with no shackles on them for content, or language, or occasionally happy endings, or needing to cast nothing but beautiful, mostly white actors as they wound up doing at the end.  

_Homicide_ is good.  _The Wire_ is fucking amazing.

_like saying you’re a huge Shakespeare fan but you don’t have any interest in reading this “Hamlet” thing people keep talking about._

Loved _Homicide_, can’t afford HBO and fully expect to see and enjoy _the Wire_ when it comes out on A&E (worked for _the Sopranos, anyway_) or some other network I can afford. 

But, as much as I respect much of Shakespeare’s work, “Hamlet” is crap. The main character is poorly defined and unlikeable, the action deeply unlikely, the culture all about misogynistic aristocratic privilege without real responsibility. I’ve seen it staged, seen a movie version or two, and I’ve never enjoyed it. I’ve read it in school, and nobody’s ever really explained what’s so “great” about it  with any clarity. “To be or not to be” is an OK speech, but really quite overwrought in context.

alright, the forces intent on making me watch The Wire are now conspiring, from my colleagues to my family to the blogs I read. I’ve held out for a while because I. Just. Don’t. Like. Cop. Shows.  So I’m not gonna drop $80 for it, but maybe pull a show down from Itunes and check it out.  As a lowly grad student I’d have to giuve up my tuna and ramen ration to afford the cable upgrade (I”m only half kidding) so I don’t see doing that anytime soon.

any love for Mad Men out there?  That’s the show that started really killing me when I discovered it, as usual, late.

Simon pulled numerous scenes from the book _Homicide_ and used them in _The Wire_, so we don’t really have to make a choice here.  (The first scene in the series, for example.)  I will say this, however: [this episode](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0604435/) may’ve been the finest hour of television ever, and it’s a _Homicide_ episode.  Not only that, it’s from an otherwise terrible sixth season.  (What is it with sixth seasons being terrible but containing just one gem?  _Buffy_ has “Once More With Feeling,” &c.)

_I’ve held out for a while because I. Just. Don’t. Like. Cop. Shows._

It’s not really a cop show.  The real focus is the American empire in decline.  Successive seasons of the show give detailed portraits of different aspects of the modern American city — the justice system, labor and industry, politics, public schools and the media, in that order.  The cops angle is just the narrative entry point to all those issues.

This is false, or at least implies teh false.  That is, David Simon did not create _Homicide_.  He wrote the book which inspired the show, and was a writer on the show, but Tom Fontana is to _Homicide_ as _David Simon_ is to The Wire.
