## Watchmen and the scene of reading (being a response to Anthony Lane’s review of Zack Snyder’s adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ novel)

(_Pre-preface: I didn’t intend on x-posting this, but I was asked why I didn’t so I am.  If I seem to have a complex about x-posting that’s because I do.  There’s something self-important about posting the same bit in three different places and I don’t want to seem self-important.  I recognize there’s some overlap in audience, but I honestly believe it’s not nearly so great as other people think.  Another way to ask this would be: how many of you read **[Acephalou](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)s** or [**The Valve**](http://www.thevalve.org/)?  Would it annoy you to see the same post in three places?  Now for the actual preface._)

(_Before I begin: Lane casually spoils the film, so do not click on that link if you want a virginal viewing experience._)

Anthony Lane would forestall serious criticism of his [_Watchmen_ review](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2009/03/09/090309crci\_cinema\_lane) by characterizing defenders of _the genre_ as “masonically loyal, prickling with a defensiveness and an ardor that not even Wagnerians can match.” Anyone who reads a comic not written by Art Spiegelman is a—but why go there? Lane’s acknowledgment that Moore wants nothing to do with Zack Snyder’s film seems a concession, but in the end he returns to throw a few roundhouses at Moore:

Amid these pompous grabs at horror, neither author nor director has much grasp of what genuine, unhyped suffering might be like, or what pity should attend it; they are too busy fussing over the fate of the human race—a sure sign of metaphysical vulgarity—to be bothered with lesser plights.

To belabor the obvious: _Watchmen_ is a book of the 1980s. Complaining about its concern with issues like containment, nuclear escalation, and mutually assured destruction would be akin to kvetching about the dowdiness of suburban American life in _Far From Heaven_—and [Lane did not](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/far\_from\_heaven\_haynes). So why fault _Watchmen_ for being insufficiently universal in its appeal? Why insist that a film based on a graphic novel be of the moment the former is produced instead of the one represented in the latter?

Because Lane is an ignorant bigot.\*

Not that I want to defend Snyder’s film. As will become apparent, I think the film will fail because it is fundamentally unfilmable. But for someone who complains about the lack of subtlety in film and novel alike, Lane punts some rather obvious points. Foremost among them, he attributes the flaws of particular characters to the author, as when he chastises Moore:

You want to hear Moore’s attempt at urban jeremiad? “This awful city, it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.” That line from the book may be meant as a punky retread of James Ellroy, but it sounds to me like a writer trying much, much too hard; either way, it makes it directly into the movie, as one of Rorschach’s voice-overs.

Why assume that Rorschach’s a proxy for Moore here?  Why _not_ assume Rorschach’s narration is intentionally blinkered and overblown?  Consider these panels:

[![Ror02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4a429970c-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4a429970c-pi)

Rorschach’s statements are—to borrow Lane’s characterization of the entire film—grimy with misogyny, but more revealingly, they are also self-evidently delusional.  Rorschach numbers himself among the psychologically healthy.  Even within the fiction of the novel, Rorschach’s narration belongs to “the crank file”:

[![Ror03](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01127919a2b628a4-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01127919a2b628a4-pi)

Yet Lane would have his readers believe that the self-important and overwrought prose of Rorschach’s journal stands as an indictment of Moore.  Mistaking the flaws of a character for those of his author is argument Lane would rightly criticize were someone else to forward it.  He would also take issue with a critic who denigrated as derivative a film which openly played with generic conventions.  For example, were someone to slag Todd Haynes for directing the aforementioned _Far From Heaven_ in the style of Douglas Sirk, I would expect Lane to dismiss this someone on the grounds that their unfamiliarity with the genre and period have led them to confuse the enlivening of a cliché for another unthinking repetition.  To wit:

There is Dan (Patrick Wilson), better known as Nite Owl, who keeps his  

old superhero outfit, rubbery and sharp-eared, locked away in his  

basement, presumably for fear of being sued for plagiarism by Bruce  

Wayne.

You want to talk about missing the point?  Because I could keep it up all day.  Only not about Lane this time: now I want to focus on Snyder.   I’m less concerned with his film than its conceit: that through slavish imitation Moore and Gibbon’s novel can transition from page to screen. The central concern in _Watchmen_ is with the experience of reading comic books.  The scene of reading is of obvious import: the youth reading _Tales of the Black Freighter_ reminds the reader that the thing in their hands was shaped by an escapist tradition.  As the world marches to war this kid reads about a marooned mariner who “saves” his home by becoming the thing he sought to save it from.  Moore interleaves this narrative such that it comments on events outside of it.

That is to say: _Tales of the Black Freighter_ reflects for readers of _Watchmen_ the process by which cultural artifacts acquire meaning in the larger world.  The message here is quite direct: escapist literature tells us something about the world readers want to escape.  To wit:

[![Pirate01](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4cb32970c-320wi "Pirate01")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4cb32970c-pi)

While the vendor boats about never retreating from reality, the black youth “retreats” into a narrative which speaks more directly to the situation in the world than any newspaper.  (_Spoilers to follow._)  While the newspapers track world-historical negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, _Tales of the Black Freighter_ narrates the story of a man whose good intentions lead to unspeakable horror.  The mariner’s plight directly parallels that of Ozymandias: therefore readers of _Tales from the Black Freighter_ better understand why the novel ends as it does than “well-informed” citizenry whose reading was limited to Platitudes of State and their daily repetition.

Moore champions the unserious—a category that often encompasses the whole of literature—and does so in a way particular to the medium of comics.  The average reader cannot follow the narrative complexity of a William Gaddis novel because it depends too heavily on a Jamesian ear for vocal peculiarities.  But the value of a Gaddis novel is not solely located in the virtuoso performances of its author: the complexity created by the overlapping narratives produces a more Talmudic world.  No statement exists in isolation.  Every comment is a commentary on every other comment past and future.

Hence Dr. Manhattan.

(_But as this post has gotten prohibitively long, I will save the rest of it for later_.)

In response to your x-posting question, I will say this, Scott: I read _The Valve_ and don’t mind cross-posting.  I used to read _Acephalous_ more, but I just figure that everything you post there is x-posted elsewhere so I don’t check it much anymore.  Clearly I am wrong in this assumption

[I read EotW and Acephalous, not the Valve. The discussions at E and A are sufficiently different that I have, at times, participated in both. The discussions at V are sufficiently literature/theory heavy that I have no idea what’s going on most of the time.]

It is interesting to note the NiteOwl/Batman connection: Moore’s comics have involved such different conceptions of the superhero (though there’s an interesting parallel between the government’s use of Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen and the government’s use of Superman in Dark Knight and their respective failures to solve the problems of the world despite their immense powers.) that I didn’t even notice the similarity until it was pointed out. There have been other bird-themed superheroes before, though — as someone who’s familiar with Hawkman, etc., it didn’t phase me much, where as Lane is clearly uncomfortable with the genre and actually unfamiliar with its idioms beyond the level of cliche.

Tom, I mostly keep the more day-to-day and pedagogical stuff over at _Acephalous_.  

Ahistoricality, I’ll touch on Manhattan tomorrow, but what’s really odd/pessimistic is this: even with a Manhattan, Russia still invaded Afghanistan.  In short, Moore argues that so long as these superheroes have a mind of their own—that is, so long as they’re not weaponized—the most they can do is forestall the inevitable.

yeah, the passage you choose really shows just how little he bothers to learn about the form that he’s criticizing, or more specifically the origins of the comic that the movie is based on.  Nite Owl is (like all of the Watchmen heroes) based on a Charleston character that was the rip-off of Batman that Lane thinks he’s so cleverly spotted, and then was re-made slightly differently after DC became uncomfortable with Moore’s revisions. ( i know you know that, and I figure everyone else here does too, so I don’t know why I wrote that.  Maybe a lifetime of reading comics makes me unable to resist the impulse to heavy-handedly engage in exposition while ostensibly writing dialogue?)   

What would be nice would be some kind of meta-treatment–I don’t know what medium, comics probably–that could incorporate Lane’s review into the layers, maybe as another example of what you don’t get when you consider “unserious” forms beneath your notice.  I mean, he thinks he’s critiquing Moore when he’s actually walked right into a trap door critique hidden in Moore’s book, one that only activates when it gets moved to a medium where it’s likely to be experienced and critiqued by people who don’t know anything about comics.

I’d love to see the rest of what you have to say.  I don’t read the other blogs you write at because…I don;t know, I’m a grad student with limited time, and just this one is dangerously engaging.

_Russia still invaded Afghanistan._  

I’m not committed to this argument, but one take on that has to be that Moore hasn’t fully thought through the implications of Dr. Manhattan existing, and how it would change the strategies of U.S. opponents.

[I read all three, and for posts I expect to have sufficiently interesting discussion, will follow the threads in more than one place.  For the record, I love the _hell_ out of what I think of as your heavy-duty-nerdery posts — e.g. this one, other recent comics-related stuff, etc.]  

I incline to agree with your assessment of the film’s likely quality.  I don’t think _anyone_ could adequately film 
Watchmen
, which was meant precisely as an exploration of what could be done with the medium of comics as opposed to other forms, and much less Snyder, whose previous work hardly inspires confidence.  But it certainly seems as though Lane had no such stuff in his thoughts, and merely found a highly anticipated comic-book movie to be a good excuse to mock the readers of comics.

Russia only invades Afghanistan, if I recall correctly, once Manhattan disappears after the press conference.   The existence of a superhero (not the costumed adventurers) _does_ markedly change the world:  1980s America won Vietnam, and is governed under the Nixon administration.  

As far as Lane goes, I haven’t (for obvious reasons) seen the film yet, so I won’t review his review until then, but given the director’s job on _300_, it wouldn’t surprise me if in the movie, Rorschach is taken as an author surrogate.

_I know you know that, and I figure everyone else here does too, so I don’t know why I wrote that._

I doubt everyone knows that—and I only learned it when I read _Watching the Watchmen_.  Edify away!

_he thinks he’s critiquing Moore when he’s actually walked right into a trap door critique hidden in Moore’s book, one that only activates when it gets moved to a medium where it’s likely to be experienced and critiqued by people who don’t know anything about comics._

But—but—but—_Watchmen_ wasn’t written by Spiegleman!  No way can it anticipate my critique!  (Or, as you say, it be the _very critique_ Lane thinks he’s so cleverly made.)  What galls me about this is that Lane can be very smart sometimes, then let snobbery snuff his critical faculties.  The talent is with the artist, not the medium.  (He’s been similarly critical of television shows in the past—talked about their inherent sloppiness because of the time they have for development.  It never occurred to him that different could be, you know, differently better.)

_I’d love to see the rest of what you have to say. I don’t read the other blogs you write at because…I don’t know, I’m a grad student with limited time_.

I remember those days!  They were so yore!  (Seriously though, I’ll x-post now that I know there’s interest.  I think the conversations are sufficiently different, and if nothing else, I can claim it’s a sociological experiment about audience.)  (Or something.)

_I’m not committed to this argument, but one take on that has to be that Moore hasn’t fully thought through the implications of Dr. Manhattan existing, and how it would change the strategies of U.S. opponents._

Actually, I think he had but is just deeply, deeply pessimistic.  (I’ll address that more via Manhattan.)

_For the record, I love the hell out of what I think of as your heavy-duty-nerdery posts — e.g. this one, other recent comics-related stuff, etc._

I’ve gotten a lot of this lately, and from a lot of people I wouldn’t think were otherwise interested.  I think there are many more secret nerds in history and literature departments than people suspect.  If only one of them was on a hiring committee . . . 

_I don’t think anyone could adequately film Watchmen, which was meant precisely as an exploration of what could be done with the medium of comics as opposed to other forms, and much less Snyder, whose previous work hardly inspires confidence._

Terry Gilliam spent six years trying before he came to share your conclusion.  HBO’s [_First Look_](http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/32714870.html) on _Watchmen_ inspires no confidence.  Snyder clearly doesn’t understand the material—and that is why he was able to make the film.  He didn’t realize the extent to which it can’t be filmed.  For example (and to preview the Manhattan post), with Manhattan Moore futzes with the convention of the scene-to-scene panel transition.  Normally, characters are in one place, the scene changes, then they’re in another.  By literalizing the transition, Moore calls attention to the convention; once this happens, the characters can’t handle it.  So every time Manhattan effects a scene-to-scene transition from _within the comic itself_, everyone along for the ride pukes uncontrollably.  (That’s also the beauty of the scene in which he mass-teleports the studio audience into the parking lot: Moore doesn’t show it, but Manhattan just created a world-horrible vomitorium.)  

And the above paragraph is why these posts are so long.  It’ll make more sense tomorrow, I promise.  

_Russia only invades Afghanistan, if I recall correctly, once Manhattan disappears after the press conference. The existence of a superhero (not the costumed adventurers) does markedly change the world: 1980s America won Vietnam, and is governed under the Nixon administration._ 

You’re right about Afghanistan, but that’s the rub: Manhattan can only forestall further Cold War escalation so long as he agrees to become a weapon.  I’ll talk tomorrow about how this might explain why he refuses to intervene when, say, the Comedian shoots a pregnant woman or Ozymandias does what he does.  I’m being dense again.  More tomorrow.

**[snarkout](http://www.snarkout.org/)**

					

		

In my view Moore is presenting fondness for comics in _Watchmen_ as symptomatic of a _sickness_. There’s not a single sexually healthy character in a mask, and I think Moore is conflicted about why he finds comics — with their black-and-white morality and weird juvenile obsessions — so appealing. Making a hero of Rorschach (who — Jesus, you’re a dope, Anthony Lane — is essentially pathetic in his grotesquerie) isn’t solely a fuck-you to his readers, but I think there’s a little bit of that in there. Only a man who loves comic books as much and as smartly as Alan Moore does could communicate his ambivalence so effectively, and I think that’s the aspect that’s going to be most wholly missing from Snyder’s adaption. There might be someone out there who could have played with Nite Owl’s sad-sack impotent self effectively, but it sure as hell isn’t going to be the director of _300_.

yeah, I read it as it came out, and read and re-read each issue.  I think there’s alot that I didn’t get, and some that I got emotionally but didn’t have the tools to understand intellectually.  Reading it all at once makes it easier to see the themes, but the experience of hanging on that comic and a few others (Love & Rockets, Cerebus, Moore’s Swamp Thing) was something else.  that was a crazy-good period for comics.

Lane is usually the best critic the N’Yawker has, but — bear in mind — he also taught himself to speak Elvish.

It’s never pretty when one species of nerd pisses on another species of nerdishness in order to make himself feel less nerdy.

**Julian**

					

		

Lane didn’t read Watchmen, but it still sounds like the movie is bad.  If Lane missed the point about Rorscach’s tragic self-absorption then maybe Snyder didn’t put it in the film.  The story might’ve been translated as a conventional boomsplosion blockbuster.  Or maybe Lane’s prejudices overpowered his ability to notice good storytelling.  I doubt it.

Then read the review, Julian.  I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the film is rubbish (and I would definitely be surprised if Snyder had a deft enough touch to show Rorschach and his worldview for all that it is), but Lane apparently feels qualified to judge the book on the basis of the film (plus his own ignorant preconceptions).  It would take the merest glance at the book to understand why it’s ridiculous to conflate it with McFarlane-style ‘badasses and chicks with big tits’ mainstream superhero comics, but I guess Lane wanted to make a clown of himself instead.

This somewhat less temperate response to the review is a bit of a giggle: [http://mountainofjudgment.blogspot.com/2009/03/anthony-lane-watches-watchmen.html](http://mountainofjudgment.blogspot.com/2009/03/anthony-lane-watches-watchmen.html)

_While the newspapers track world-historical negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, Tales of the Black Freighter narrates the story of a man whose good intentions lead to unspeakable horror._

I might be a bit thick; I never even noticed that, even though it makes perfect sense. Although one way the parallel breaks down (SPOILERS, although the warning probably isn’t needed around here) is that Ozymandias never comes to realize his unspeakable horror.

I thought the main subtext of _Watchmen_ was that it serves as both a traditional comic book superhero story and a deconstruction of them. Masked vigilantes team up to stop world-spanning machinations of a ruthless genius, but behind it all those masked vigilantes have sexual hangups and midlife crises and sometimes the bad guys win, and if they genuinely had superpowers they wouldn’t be able to relate to humanity at all and the course of history would quickly become unrecognizable. In that interpretation, I saw the _Tales from the Black Freighter_ interludes as homages to the non-superhero side of the comic book medium, which was once much more important than it had become by the 1980s.

And in the sense that _Watchmen_ is a traditional comic book story, it might be as filmable as any other. There still is the story about desperate, disparate heroes trying to stop an evil genius. The movie won’t be as good as the comic was, but nor does it have to be an utter disgrace like people seem to expect. We’ll see.

Snarkout:

That’s sort of how Moore does things, by going through a series of extreme takes on a topic, as a way of burrowing in on the truth. To give you an example of how I see his oeuvre dealing with superheroes:

1. V for Vendetta – construction of the superhero as terrorist; when the normal institutions of society fails and humanity is in the grasp of fascism, you (might) need the audacity of the deed to tear down inherently evil social structures. The hero becomes an anarchist instrument.  

2. Watchmen – deconstructing the superhero as an inherently screwed up model for human behavior when the normal institutions of society do exist, which appeals to and creates psychologically screwed up people and deforms human society. The hero becomes a fascist instrument.  

3. From Hell – possibly the construction of the supervillain? Not sure if this one fits.  

4. LoEG/Tom Strong/Promethea/Top 10 – Moore has prominently said that he thinks the “grittier, darker” fad went in a bad way, away from really thinking about what superheroes mean to just throwing in sex and violence to boost sales. His re-construction of superheroes tends to try to capture what was great about early superheroes, but in a different fashion each time: LoEG is about the nature of the hero as fiction and what happens when the fictional is made real, it’s also revealing the underbelly of the past and reconstructing “our heroes” as representative of the uglier side of Victorian culture while still being heroic; Tom Strong is about tapping into the sense of wonder and the belief in progress of pulp fiction, notably the title character uses reason as well as violence, seeks to resolve situations through constructing institutions rather than just beating people up, etc.; Promethea is the imagination as superhero, the desire for mystic revelation and self-actualization; and Top 10, a police-procedural is really about the nature of the ordinary hero, by valuing civil servants in a world where superpowers are totally banal.

“I know people think me callous, but I’ve made myself feel every death. By day I imagine endless faces. By night… Well, I dream, about swimming towards a hideous… No, never mind, it isn’t significant.”

StevenAttewell: There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on in his _Tom Strong_ spinoff _Terra Obscura_ as well, I think – sort of Moore’s explicit recreation of how we got from the four-color superhero comics of the ’60s to where we are now.

What a dumb review.  Obviously he’s not read the book, or at least looked at it closely, and the movie may well suck, but that was terrible.  You can’t help but know it will be terrible when he starts complaining about Bob Dylan playing, showing how he doesn’t know that this is there for a reason.  It’s all down-hill from there.  

\_why he refuses to intervene\_  

I’m not sure Dr. Manhattan can be said to “refuse” to intervene.  He doesn’t, and he knows he doesn’t, and maybe he even just knows that he will choose not to, if that makes sense, but I never get the impression of his refusing to do things.  He doesn’t know the future and then decide to go along with it.  Rather- he knows that he will not act, just like he knows he will be surprised in a minute.

SPOILER

“returns to normal”? Yes, except that either a) the entire world throws itself into a frantic effort to build up defences against the threat of non-existent giant telepathic alien attack, or b) Veidt’s plan is revealed via Rorschach’s diary and the richest man in the world is pursued for mass murder of half a million people.

The normal state of things (as represented in the comic) being turmoil, misery, and chaos.  Manhattan tells Veidt that nothing ends, right as he leaves him to create new life or whatever.  I probably stated it too glibly.  I think Moore’s viewpoint is that no amount of power or trickery can make us safe again.  And that that’s the natural and inevitable state of things.

The key sentence in Lane’s review is this:

“The problem is that Snyder, following Moore, is so insanely aroused by the look of vengeance, and by the stylized application of physical power, that the film ends up twice as fascistic as the forces it wishes to lampoon.”

I haven’t seen the film, of course, but I agree with Lane that the kind of lovingly detailed violence that’s a staple of graphic novels is indeed fascistic, sadistic fantasy wish fulfillment.

Now, perhaps Lane is an ignorant bigot because he doesn’t like to watch bloody enactments of rape and murder.  Or perhaps people who choose to spend their free time looking at murder, rape, and mutilation imagery are perverts.

Anyone want to have that conversation?

Bloix, my problem isn’t with Lane decrying the movie as pornographic in its fetishization (is that a word?) of violence. It probably does; I haven’t seen it. My problem is with that parenthetical phrase “following Moore”, which is just not true given what we know of Moore’s work, his blind spots, his views then and now, the actual construction of the comic, oh gods I could go on but should stop here…

The violence is not lovingly detailed in the original (unless you want to view the opening of the final issue as revelling in carnage as opposed to disgust with it). In my own reading of the source material, Moore’s point was to drag down these “staples of graphic novels” from glorified status to the banal brutality they would be in something approaching the real world. Whether he succeeded is open for debate, but tarring Moore with Snyder is just inane.

There’s something insultingly dishonest about this segue at the start of Lane’s piece, too:

“…there seem to be shelves of cod mythology and rainy dystopias, patrolled by rock-jawed heroes and their melon-breasted sidekicks. Fans of the stuff are masonically loyal, prickling with a defensiveness and an ardor that not even Wagnerians can match. One lord of the genre is a glowering, hairy Englishman named Alan Moore…”

Nowhere does he say that Moore is responsible for said cod mythology and implausible female physiques, but the implication is clearly crafted — and utterly misleading

Go on, make some more inferences about me from the nom de plume :-) I’m not actually a huge fan of the gore component in the comic series, my affection largely stems from selected parts of a certain run or arc in the comic’s history. If you saw the email address I provided, you could make some diametrically opposed inferences too.

A-ny-ways… “Violence in comics” is like “inhumanity in books” — whether it is justifiable, blinkered, pornographic, satirical or otherwise depends on the material in question, and the extent matters too. Most of the time I don’t particularly like it, and don’t think it serves much purpose beyond titillation or Tom-and-Jerry level escapism. Evidently I managed to give the opposite impression, which is unfortunate.

Hellblazer–agreed completely about the assumption that Snyder’s movie   accurately reflects the content, scope, themes, etc. of Moore’s original work, and what that says for Lane’s (lack of) rigor or honesty.  You don’t even have to have seen the movie to know that what he attributes to the book doesn’t reflect careful attention to or familiarity with the history and conventions of the form.  And this is a real drawback since that history and those conventions are a huge part of what the book is actually about.  

I’m happy to have a conversation about violence in graphic novels in general.  It’s a pretty short conversation for me: there’s too much of it and it’s bad and its boring and it’s a really bad thing for violence to be so ubiquitous it’s boring.  Bad for the audience, bad as a social articulation, bad, bad bad.

But that doesn’t really have much to do with Watchmen for me, except that what Watchmen did for me as a reader at 21 years old, which was initiate a conversation about, among other things, the implications of the violence in the generic form, the political implications and the physical implications.  That conversation didn’t get taken up, but you can’t lay that at Moore’s feet.  Not even totally at Frank Miller’s.  It’s like blaming Nirvana for Stone Temple Pirates.

Nice to see a well-put and intelligent rebuttal of an obnoxious and frustrating-to-read _New Yorker_ review.

As someone who loved the original novel and did not love the movie, I found Lane’s apparent belief that you can review a book based on the movie adaptation remarkably ignorant. Way to put him in his place.
