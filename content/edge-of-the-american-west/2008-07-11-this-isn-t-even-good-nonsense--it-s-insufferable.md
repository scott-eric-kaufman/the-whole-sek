## This isn’t even good nonsense.  It’s insufferable.*

 * Friday, July 11, 2008

On this day in 1930, the only man to [ingest every major work ever written](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/im\_almost\_tempted\_to\_believe\_him/) and survive, Harold Bloom, was born.  His feats of [speed and memorization](http://209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:uiJ32F\_2FQkJ:www2.arnes.si/~bjason/CANON.doc+%!H(MISSING)e+had+that+extraordinary+ability+to+read+a+book+almost+as+fast+as+you+can+turn+the+pages,+not+only+to+read+it+but+to+practically+memorize+it.%!&(MISSING)hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&lr=lang\_en&client=firefox-a) are legend, but even most literary scholars are unaware that not only has he consumed the entire Western Canon, he has written a magisterial tome about _each and every item contained therein_.  

In an April interview concerning the three-month lag between the publication of Thomas Pynchon’s [_Against the Day_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143112562/diesekoschmar-20) and [his anxious, Gnostic appreciation of it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555460623/diesekoschmar-20), Bloom confessed he finds it “increasingly difficult to remain abreast of major works of late because so many of them suck balls.”  Asked to clarify, Bloom refused to mince words: “When I declared [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061120057/diesekoschmar-20) the best novel in the history of ever, I must have been asleep.  It wouldn’t be the first book I’ve composed thus.”

When reached for comment, John Crowley was found on the floor weeping uncontrollably.  His agent, Richard Cummings, on a stepladder in the hall affixing a noose to the ceiling fan, was also unavailable for comment.

Bash Bloom all you want, but lay off John Crowley!

_Little, Big_, in particular.  Or suffer an epic beat down.

Best novel in the history of ever?  No.  But very, very good.

And he ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.

Your omission of the name of Bloom’s most influential work bespeaks a certain … anxiety.

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

I adore _Little, Big_ — although I like _Aegypt_ a bit more — but it doesn’t deserve the accolades Bloom’s lavished on it because _no_ book deserves the accolades Bloom’s lavished on it.

**[todd.](http://tonguebutnodoor.net)**

					

		

I had the same thought as urbino. We’re picking four authors, and we’re going to take DeLillo? I dropped the Lit. major as a sophomore and I know that’s a bad idea.

**urbino**

					

		

Urbino hearts SEK, too.  (And James Wood.)  DeLillo as our foremost “novelist of ideas” is a bit of conventional wisdom that makes me vaguely ill (an esophagus-borne digestive event).

Quoth Wood:

Brian’s rapt tone—bathetically close in impulse to Wordsworth on the Simplon Pass, or to Ruskin on Rouen Cathedral…

Or Henry Adams on Wenlock Edge.

One wonders how this turn in Bloom’s evaluation of _Little, Big_ will affect the 25th anniv. edition.  I assume — hope, that is — it’s gotten too far down the road for Bloom to back out, but one wonders what his introductory essay now says.

Oops.  I seem to have muffed the block quote tags.  Wood leaves off at the ellipses, and I pick up again.

Add one more to the Crowely file of Crowleyphiles, though I, too, prefer _Aegypt_ to _Little, Big_. I happened to be in NYC last spring when Crowley read from _Endless Things_, the novel that finally completed the series, at KGB; the joy that swept the crowd when he began reading was hard to describe, a feeling utterly foreign to the generally solitary pleasures of literature reading, yet irresistible and lovely.

Bloom’s claims regarding his feats of fast reading come in for some withering mockery in one of David Markson’s recents, but I can’t remember which.  One of the earlier ones.

Beat me.  I read it a few weeks ago partly because a bunch of you recommended it, and while I thought it had many beautiful sentences, it did a lot of dilly-dallying to no very earned end.  Pbbl.

And DeLillo is good, especially _White Noise_.

Which is why I didn’t mention that you all had let me down so epically by recommending that book. I only bring it up now because you’re getting all belligerent.

I wouldn’t object to your saying you were disappointed with it.  My belligerence was in play.  Mostly.  Bloom brings out the belligerent in me.  I agree with him about _Blood Meridian_ and with his former high regard for _Little, Big_, but in general I find him greatly overrated as a judge of English-language literature.

**[eric](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

I carry no brief for Bloom either way.  

_Little, Big_:  I think about halfway through I was disappointed in it, because I realized where it was going and how long it was going to take to get there (this was when he dropped the GIANT ANVIL with TITANIA’S NAME ON IT).  By the time I finished it I was no longer disappointed, I was just annoyed, especially because he awarded himself the right to be coy about Titania’s name.  Please, dude.

If you had read the subtitle on the table of contents (“Or, the Fairies’ Parliament”), you could have realized where it was going right away.

Or if you had read the post [I wrote just for you](http://waste.typepad.com/waste/2007/12/conference-of-t.html).

I got that it was a book about the Fairies, Ben.  It was treating the specific identity of the characters in such an anvilly fashion that was annoying.

And I read that post, and thank you.  I still like the post about the hippies better.

Was there an ass involved?  I don’t remember an ass.

Seriously, though, LB is one of those books that, if you’re not enjoying the ride, you’re going to have hard feelings about the journey.  It’s not strong on plot and payoff.  And part of the point — I _think_ — is to knowingly incorporate elements of various other literary fantasies.  It’s a mashup.

I read twenty pages of LB, because the blogosphere gushed so, but I couldn’t make myself keep going.  And I love Don DeLillo.  It’s almost as if literary taste is actually idiosyncratic, and the notion that we can form a definitive list of good books is an illusion that we can’t bear to give up.

Interesting that the landlord would comment that Pynchon is seen as a stoner hippy in his Pynchon review,  since I think there is a bit of stoner hippy in Crowley’s Little Big that might be characterized as self indulgence.  The same could be said of Aegypt.  I liked them both quite a lot anyway but I remember having had that reservation about both books.  Sort of  like Dude, don’t smoke so much while you’re writing.

**[Levi Stahl](http://ivebeenreadinglately.com/)**

					

		

Urbino’s right about _Little, Big_: you’ve gotta be ready to go with its flow; if you do, the payoff is lovely.

The _Aegypt_ series is somewhat similar, but the overall story is more rooted in realism and a specific time here on earth, so there’s more to hold on to; plus, Crowley’s ambitions are so much bigger that there are points when I set the books down and simply marveled for a moment. He manages in that group of books to marry very real observations of human behavior with incredibly large, era-spanning themes about knowledge, eros, magic, history, learning, and probably a dozen other things. 

Overlook just brought the first three volumes, _The Solitudes_, _Love and Sleep_, and _Daemonomania_, back into print. I can’t promise you’ll be convinced, but it’s at least worth taking a quick look the next time you’re in the bookstore. Especially you, Eric: it may not be your cup of tea, but it’s far likelier to be than _Little, Big_ was, methinks.

Also quite good is _The Translator_, which is a normal novel about the normal world.  Well, it’s set in a university, so not so normal.

**[andrew](http://thewayside.wordpress.com)**

					

		

From the Amazon “product description” on the page Scott links: 

John Crowley’s masterful Little, Big is the epic story of Smoky Barnable, an anonymous young man who travels by foot from the City to a place called Edgewood—not found on any map—to marry Daily Alice Drinkawater, as was prophesied. It is the story of four generations of a singular family, living in a house that is many houses on the magical border of an otherworld. It is a story of fantastic love and heartrending loss; of impossible things and unshakable destinies; and of the great Tale that envelops us all. It is a wonder.  

I take the fact that I could not imagine ever wanting to read this book based on that bit of copy as a sign that I have very different literary tastes from most in this thread. I have not read DeLillo, so I can’t weigh in on that debate.

People recommended LB (_Little, Big_, not LizardBreath) back in my days on rec.arts.books, say 1990.  I got about ten pages in and stuck.  That blurb reminds me of why.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

There’s a very specific way in which this blurb goes wrong.  I don’t really want to invest too much effort in trying to explain myself, but I’ll give it a shot.  _Little, Big_ is not about a place not on any map, a magical otherworld, a Tale that envelops us all, and other fatuous generalities.  It’s set in a very specific American temporary autonomous zone — the Western New York burned-over district, the Theosophists, the people who took pictures and looked in the borders to see if they could catch sight of fairies.  It’s marginal, but a specific marginality, a story of a particular loose subculture and what their success would have to look like.

That specificity is what saves it from, well, the normal reaction of people who would dislike that kind of blurb.  It’s not that you really have to be interested in that subculture — I wasn’t.  It’s that there’s a sharp edge under there.

One of the edges is that for the place-not-on-any-map, magical otherworld, Tale to succeed, the real-world U.S. has to break down.  Inside the community, everyone goes to Fairie; just outside the frame, starving people.

Well… I’m not exactly trying to say that the book is the best thing since sliced bread.  I’m trying to describe why, specifically, someone might dislike everything in that blurb and still like the book.

FYI, Crowley recorded an unabridged audiobook of _The Solitudes_ last year that is also excellent, since he’s a very good reader of his own prose (that being said, if it’s not your cup of tea it almost certainly will remain not your cup of tea even with the author reading it).

_I thought_ White Noise _particularly overrated._

I often like DeLillo, especially _Underworld_, but I heart urbino for this. _White Noise_ wishes it could be _The Atrocity Exhibition_, but it doesn’t have the guts. 

Beatdowns for those who don’t like _Little, Big_. This does not extend to _Aegypt_. It does extend to _Engine Summer_, which incidentally is short (but dense). What does everyone think of _One Hundred Years of Solitude_?

What does everyone think of ending posts on a dead thread with a question?

You fail to provide a link to or citation for the supposed April interview with Bloom, the link to Bloom’s “gnostic appreciation” of _Against the Day_ is spurious, and the final paragraph of your post (and probably the middle paragraph as well) is a fiction as cheap as your cynicism.  I understand your bad attitude is almost certainly a lost cause, but could you possibly rectify the earlier (c)om(m)issions?  With thanks.

_What does everyone think of One Hundred Years of Solitude?_

I’ve had that one for years, but haven’t gotten around to reading it.  _Love in the Time of Cholera_, however, I loved.

Speaking of getting around to reading things, and by way of demonstrating I’m not entirely disagreeable on subjects literary, I finally read _Gentlemen of the Road_, eric.  A hoot, is what it is.

_What does everyone think of One Hundred Years of Solitude?_

I loved it when I read it, but that was well over a decade ago now, and with the exception of _Ulysses_ and a few others, my experience with reading books I once loved has been universally bad.  

_You fail to provide a link to or citation for the supposed April interview with Bloom, the link to Bloom’s “gnostic appreciation” of Against the Day is spurious, and the final paragraph of your post (and probably the middle paragraph as well) is a fiction as cheap as your cynicism.

I’m not sure how to indicate that I’m making shit up than to say Bloom’s got an introduction to _Against the Day_, link to his introduction of _Gravity’s Rainbow_, put the words “suck balls” in his mouth, shove a famous author to the floor, suicide his agent, and title the post “[t]his isn’t even good nonsense[, i]t’s insufferable.”  Suggestions?

_What does everyone think of ending posts on a dead thread with a question?_

On this blog, there’s a brief window of opportunity, while your comment is still visible at the upper left (i.e., is among the most recent 15).  After that, it falls off the edge of the world and is not heard from again, unless a newer comment on the same post brings it within range once more.

I too have been mostly bored by Garcia Marquez, though _Love in the Time of Cholera_ likewise left a vague positive impression, and the movie of “No-one Writes to the Colonel” had a satisfyingly strong narrative structure.

I appear to be the only one amongst your readers to have noticed.  If you wish to trash Bloom, why not do so on the basis of what he actually wrote, and why posit spurious reversals in his opinions?  It’s not like there’s a lack of actual usable material.  What you gave us was a cheap shot, and god knows we’re all tempted to take cheap shots from time to time, but in a world rotting out from the core because there’s little else but that in the way of public discourse, why add to it?

Further to Vance’s point, when you ask helps determine who will answer.  I’m more early-to-bed, early-to-rise, and Ari is decadent.  And so on, for others.

_Yeah yeah. I appear to be the only one amongst your readers to have noticed._  

I did too, although I took the post’s title to refer to LB, not the post itself, and I was taken in Bloom’s “anxious, Gnostic interpretation” of AtD.  

_If you wish to trash Bloom, why not do so on the basis of what he actually wrote, and why posit spurious reversals in his opinions?_  

I think SEK intended to trash LB, and Bloom only incidentally for his praise of LB.
