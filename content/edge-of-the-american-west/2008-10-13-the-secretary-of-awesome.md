[Kotsko](http://heteronomy.wordpress.com/)‘s been on a roll of late, but given the relative lack of comments, I wonder if his sudden and unannounced move—I didn’t even [notice it at the time](http://heteronomy.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/a-slight-change/), but I was a [_wee_ preoccupied](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/this-blog-is-no.html)—didn’t lose him some audience.

In case it did, I urge you to check out his post on [what Ayers and Wright tell us about Obama](http://heteronomy.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/what-do-ayers-and-wright-tell-us-about-obama/), _i.e._ “[p]robably that he’s willing to work on a pragmatic level with people whose views and past activities he disagrees with, if that’s what it takes to meet a worthwhile goal.”  While you’re there, check out his divination of [the conservative boilerplate](http://heteronomy.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/73-of-right-wing-blog-posts-ever/).
