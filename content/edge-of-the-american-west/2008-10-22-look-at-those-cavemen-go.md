Via [Shahar](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/some-directors-do-mccain-attack-ads/), McCain ads in the style of John Woo, Kevin Smith and Wes Anderson:


The Woo (0:00) I could take or leave; the Smith (1:42) reminds me (yet again) how poorly _Clerks_ has aged; but the Anderson (2:21) is brilliant.  No more commentary from meâ€”I have a talk to 
write
 tweak a few minor points in.
