Via [Shahar](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/some-directors-do-mccain-attack-ads/), McCain ads in the style of John Woo, Kevin Smith and Wes Anderson:



The Woo (0:00) I could take or leave; the Smith (1:42) reminds me (yet again) how poorly _Clerks_ has aged; but the Anderson (2:21) is brilliant.  No more commentary from me—I have a talk to 
write
 tweak a few minor points in.

Yes, on the Anderson.  The Bowie song could have been better chosen, and of course Anderson has produced a much better [parody of himself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spCknVcaSHg), but quite nice anyway.  Maybe McCain _should_ have Bill Murray (in sadness mode) start playing him in comercials/public appearances.  Americans love a resigned-but-still-moving-forward-becuase-he-can’t-help-himself-or-think-what-else-to-do-really loser.

I thought the Smith was the best of the lot, actually.

I liked the Anderson one the best, but really, the three stand up better as parodies of the directors themselves.  Although, come one, if they played “Wild Wookie” or “Bezerker” as background music in the Smith bit, that would have been nice.

The Woo effort gets dinged for failure to include a “gun to gun standoff” and, even more egregiously, any doves at all.

But the palm-down gun fire!  Yay for remembering palm-down gunfire!
