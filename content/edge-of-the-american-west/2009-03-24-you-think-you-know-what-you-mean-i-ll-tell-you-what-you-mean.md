_No, no I don’t think you do._

You’re upset with me because I made you go to _Protein Wisdom_, aren’t you?

Or is it because I failed to mention Walter Benn Michaels?

Or you’re thanking me because you’re in The Greatest Fun camp?  

Or you’re wondering why on earth I followed all that, what with Obama being in office?  

Or that I’m bemusedly bitter about being banned and am expressing it alliteratively?

Kramer is a more respectable interpreter of meaning than Mssr Goldstein.  But, no, I write to commiserate.  Having been banned myself there and then reading 40 more comments and being called a “pussy,” I too saw the irony.

Now, I will admit, being called pussy by a dude with a Master’s in English is less insulting someone with a real degree (I kid you, Scott), the fact that he did so after banning me was…well, pretty cowardly.

Guess he knows how it feels.

I have no idear who nk is and I read and read. He’s damn sure not Jared Padalecki.

You know what else I think though? The whole _he threatened physical violence thing_ is really goofy. You peoples know what a threat of physical violence is. I really think you do cause y’all aren’t dumb or anything. So I’m getting annoyed with that a little. Partly cause it’s so twee, but also cause it’s puerile. Twee and puerile. So enough of that I think.

Enough of that cause it’s stale and… we needs to refresh everything I think. You are not with the zeitgeist, Mr. SEK, but you want I will help.

Geez, you posted this here, too.  You’re spreading the stupid all over, Scott.

I commented at Acephalous — I should have put that comment here, and this one there.  But oh well, since I’m here now: why did you ever think that Jeff G’s theory of intentionality was worth defending?  I seem to remember you thinking that it was at least a semi-reasonable theory to hold at one time, although you personally didn’t agree with it.  I remember thinking that although I’m interested in authorial intention, his version was so strong as to be ridiculous.  So what was it ever about Jeff G that was respectable?

_But why post it on this blog? Don’t you have a personal blog where you can post stuff like this (by which I mean inter-blog navel-gazing)?_

Because a couple of weeks back [we voted](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/watchmen-and-the-scene-of-reading-being-a-response-to-anthony-lanes-review-of-zack-snyders-adaptation-of-alan-moore-and-dave-gibbons-novel/#comments) and the decision was that I should x-post my non-historical interests over here.  Given that online political rhetoric is one of them, I felt obligated.  (And you people wonder why I have a complex.)

_why did you ever think that Jeff G’s theory of intentionality was worth defending?_

Mostly because my brand of historicism embraces a weaker version of it.  The more radical notions about Dead Authors set texts afloat in seas of context, whereas the version of new historicism I adopted acknowledges that yes, of course, texts can mean more than they were intended to, but just because we can’t ever know for certain what a text was intended to mean doesn’t mean we chuck intent overboard.  We can look at an author’s ethos, consider the rhetorical appeals he or she made, look at the history of said appeals and how they function in a given historical moment, then try to discover intent via the appeals an author made to the audience they had.  For me, literary study untethered from intent is as meaningless as formalisms unhitched from context.  I aim to understand why someone thought X at historical moment Y, and how (and to whom) they deliberately expressed their sentiments is central to that.

_I understand that, but there’s a long, long way from there to “a text means whatever its author intended it to mean” or whatever Jeff G claims to believe._

Sort of.  Academic criticism of the Dead Author thesis is typically considered conservative, and in the small stakes/big knives world of academic politics, proponents of resuscitation are lumped in with actual conservatives.  (As with, say, the entire sub-discipline of law and literature.)  So it stands to reason that any sort of literary savvy displayed by actual conservatives should work in that vein, but there’s no accounting for ideological drift.  What begins — what began, with Jeff, as a theoretical position about the importance of intent became this if-we-can’t-beat-Alinsky-let’s-co-opt-him mentality.  Of course, the Alinksy they adopted bears little to no resemblance to the campaign they claimed employed his tactics, but what can you do?  (Besides study it, that is, if you’re so inclined.)

**[Rich Puchalsky](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com)**

					

		

The difference is that historicism seems to me to be mostly about authors, while the strong-intent thing is mostly about texts.  There’s no problem that I see with responding to the Dead Author thing with “Hey, people actually wrote these texts, and they often intended them to mean something, or at least wrote the text for some reason, and we shouldn’t forget them or the context of their time when we study the text”.  These is a problem with “The text has a certain, specific meaning set by the author”, because it’s just not true.  Grouping those two together both as conservative seems like the kind of thing that some leftists do when they group everyone to their right together as neoliberal.

I’ll reply tomorrow, because I didn’t reply well the first time and you’re responding to my mush.

Martin:

_But why? Why think Jeff bloody Goldstein has anything interesting to say in 200-bloody-9? What’s the point?_

For the same reason I think Jack London had something to say in 1910, actually: the situation changes, so does the effect a particular speaker has on a particular audience.  This sort of thing interests me.  I take it it’s not everyone else’s bag — but I’m basically trying to keep track of rhetorical ploys in the moment, so I don’t have to go back years later and research them.  

Have I ever mentioned I’ve written a fairly extensive history of the pirate-software scene in the South during the early ’90s?  I did the same thing there, and, well, the same thing I do everywhere — virtually or otherwise — I stand there with my notebook and keep track of what’s going on.  I thought this might be amusing because of turned tables, but what can I say?  I’ve only been blogging for a couple of years, and sometimes missteps happen.  So I pulled the post.  

That said, I do think there’s something interesting going on at _PW_ right now.  They’re trying to start a movement — an OUTLAW movement — and while it’s childish and hyperbolic, it’s _interesting_.  During the Bush years, they sat high, chastised, and unironically deployed the sad rhetoric of hypermasculinity; now, they’re using the same rhetoric, but to different ends.  Which, of course, they would . . . but given that Obama’s victory was secured, in part, by online grassroots enthusiasm, I’m interested in tracking their rhetoric along-the-way.  Maybe something becomes of it; then again, maybe not.

Some readers seemed to have clicked all those links and read all those posts and comments and then resurfaced complaining that it had made them stupider.  But they still somehow had smart things to say about it all.  Whereas I clicked and read only maybe half, at most, and it’s made me so stupid I hardly know what to say.  (Which you must admit is unusual for me — usually I have something to say, even if it’s usually something stupid.)

So this is all I have to say: it was like getting a shower of tiny blowgun darts, straight to the face, each one tipped with a little crystal of frozen novocaine.  They were launched by tiny impish robots, all painted fire-engine red, who tittered metallically before receding rapidly into some higher dimension I felt I’d understood briefly once, when I was 12, during a dream, after I’d eaten a lot of pizza and read a huge pile of DC comics before bedtime.

Not that I mean anything by this.  Unless, of course, you know different.

“They’re trying to start a movement — an OUTLAW movement […]”

This has the flaw, for a research project, of being not sufficiently historicized.  The rhetoric appears to me to be a bog-standard outgrowth of Nixonland right-wing resentment, and as such it’s part of the standard alternation between eliminationist ranting in the years in power and faux-outlaw posturing in the years out of power that has charactered the right in the North since the start of the Southern strategy.  Dave Neiwert at Orcinus has been covering the specifically Internet parts of this, and has worked out some of the historical and theoretical connections.

SEK,  

I’m not clicking on those links and don’t happen to share your particular fascination for Rightwinglandia and its internecine disputes, but, as the old folks say, whatever turns you on. I am really interested, however, in your notion of revivifying authorial intent.  Might I humbly suggest that you do a separate post on it here, which, as recent methods discussions indicate, would quite likely be of interest to us history and philosophy folks as well.

Cause, frankly, I just don’t get it.  I get it from a literary craft angle: “Did the author succeed in doing what they wanted to do” requires the prior question, “What were they trying to do?”  I get it as a biographical question, come sophistimacated parlor game.  I don’t get it as a component of textual analysis, where it seems entirely beside the point.  And from a historical (and, I assume, historicist) perspective authorial intent would be relevant only to the extent that it, or various statements about it, circulated as one of the paratexts accompanying a work of fiction.  What am I missing?

**[Rich Puchalsky](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com)**

					

		

“I don’t get it as a component of textual analysis”

What kind of textual analysis?  There are some texts that don’t appear to make sense, even considered as history-less objects, without the reading having a feeling that an author is trying to do something.  Umberto Eco wrote about this, though I’d guess he wasn’t the first, as the implied author, and again about the model author that the text creates in the mind of the model reader.  But none of that necessarily has anything to do with the thoughts or intentions of the actual author.

Historicism seems like overrreading to me, in one sense.  The historical setting of the actual author does limit what can go into the text, but it doesn’t limit the reader, so there’s a complicated relationship between it and implied authorship.

**Urk**

					

		

Jpool, I’m probably out of my depth here, but one of the ways that I think about something that’s similar to authorial intent (tho more often with songs than books) is that “authors” are also part of an audience, writing from some history of their own reading/listening, writing to some audience that likely includes them to some degree.  It’s clearer with music where it’s obvious (tho not often enough acknowledged) that musicians are part of the audiences for other musicians, and to some degree imagine themselves as “audiencing” their own performances.  For me, some version of “authorial intent” gets at authors’ understandings of how their material makes meaning, which is not necessarily lesser to or less relevant than any other audience member’s understanding.  I’m thinking here of Raymond Williams saying [paraphrase] that he’s never alone in the room while he’s writing, and following from that, it seems like ignoring intent entirely means ignoring part of the social process where [I think] meaning occurs/maintains/transforms/whatever.

but SEK probably means something else, that’s smarter.  This is not really my kickball at all.

						“They’re trying to start a movement — an OUTLAW movement […]”

This has the flaw, for a research project, of being not sufficiently historicized. The rhetoric appears to me to be a bog-standard outgrowth of Nixonland right-wing resentment, and as such it’s part of the standard alternation between eliminationist ranting in the years in power and faux-outlaw posturing in the years out of power that has charactered the right in the North since the start of the Southern strategy. Dave Neiwert at Orcinus has been covering the specifically Internet parts of this, and has worked out some of the historical and theoretical connections. Such a perfect storm of dismissiveness followed wild assertions followed by name dropping.

Like a perfect parody of academic writing.

Here’s the thing, Rich. Rather than rely on what SEK tells you I mean by intentionalism, perhaps you should query me, or better, come join in one of the discussion.  My idea, you say, is, how did you put it? — so strong as to be ridiculous — only to those of a type who bring up Nixon and right wing eliminationist ranting and are so busy ascribing base motives that they use such as a reason to avoid the discussions altogether.

When I deal with intentionalism, it is within the frame of what constitutes interpretation, why do we call what we’re doing interpretation, and just what are we interpreting.

The idea that it is intent of some agency that provides a signfier its signification is hardly so nutty as to be dismissed with the rhetoric I’m seeing here.

In fact, all I’m seeing here is a dismissal of what I supposedly argue by those who take their cues from people like Dave Neiwert.

Code words.  Jesus, how very convenient that you leave it to yourselves to build the frame, then prove its existence by identifying the secret code that proves it.

And by “identifying” I mean, of course, inventing.  Because that’s what serves your purposes.

The way the “scholars” here are all so knee jerk dismissive speaks poorly of the field I’m guessing most of us here studied in some depth.

Where SEK has gotten me very wrong recently is the idea that he seems to think I don’t appreciate the subtleties or difficulties of textual analysis, or that I don’t appreciate many of the tools one uses to tease meaning from a text.

This is wrong.

All I’m arguing is that once we enter an interpretive situation in which we agree  the author had an intent (that what we are dealing with is in fact signs, and not merely signifiers), we then set about to try to decode the text _knowing it was intended to mean_.

How we interpret, once we’ve established that baseline, is to use every tool we’ve developed to help us reconstruct intent — from convention to code to inter- and intratexuality to structuralim (I happen to be trained in narratology, and in  literary texts, I often use that as one of my primary tools) to biography, to cultural dialogics, to historicity, and on and on.

But the goal, as far as my argument goes, is to best recover the author’s meaning — his use of language — if what we say we are doing is interpreting _the same text_.

Where I differ with some theorists is that they assume that, as one person here writes,  

I get it as a biographical question, come sophistimacated parlor game. I don’t get it as a component of textual analysis, where it seems entirely beside the point. And from a historical (and, I assume, historicist) perspective authorial intent would be relevant only to the extent that it, or various statements about it, circulated as one of the paratexts accompanying a work of fiction.

Why does one need paratexts to help divine authorial intent?  Why is what the text was intended to signal “entirely beside the point,” either from an historical or historicist perspective, or from any other perspective that presents as one of its goals “interpretation”?  

All interpretation requires intent.  Whose intent is privileged in the process is, to me, both the question and the rub.

What saddens me is that people here pretend this to be some intellectual forum, and yet I’ve seen responses that serve only to diminish my argument (without knowing it) or to dismiss me out of hand (for the crime of having been labeled by others a “right winger,” which identity I’m learning saddles me with baggage that those who are doing the identifying have given themselves license to strap to my back, as a way of preemptively putting me on the defensive).

The entire tone of this thread, in fact, is one that serves as a warning to those who may disagree with the characterizations presented here:  “keep out.”

If you wish to take issue with my arguments, I’m always glad to engage on that level.  But the kinds of comments here seem to me to be trying to establish erudition and superiority without having first earned it.

Rich mentions Eco, who was, to me, a major influence.  Early on, I used to discuss a “textual entity” that I posited existed between the historical author and the intention of the text.  Having hashed this out once with Walter Benn Michaels, he convinced me that I was adding an unnecessary set of layers — that in fact all of that proceeded from the historical author, who is ultimately responsible for creating signs, and so for creating an instance of language.

Receivers can, of course, do this as well — intend to see signifiers as signs, and in doing so construct a text — but to do so knowing that what they were encountered were signs to begin with, and then bracketing the agency who created those signs as unimportant to a text’s meaning, seemed rather much like a coup.

My early academic work centered around unreliable narrators, which is what began pushing me in the direction of how one is able to detect such.  Narratology proved an invaluable tool.  

I have never, ever said that textual analysis must be dedicated solely to divining intent.  In fact, I have written on many occasions that there are many valuable things we can do with texts that aren’t tied to intepretation of text-as-implied-speech act.

What I’ve been critical of is those who have found other useful ways to engage in textual analyses who then turn around and suggest that what they have done is interpret the text that the author created.  And I don’t think one can make that claim without appealing back to the author’s intent, captured in his significations.

To do otherwise is to privilege the receiver’s intent to make a set of signifiers do what they were never intended by the author to do.

It is privileging a reader’s cleverness over a desire to understand what the author was trying to convey.

— All of which opens up the field of literary studies to a number of niche fields.  Some of you seem to think I have a problem with that.  I don’t.  I just want it made clear that the assumptions about language that underpin certain theoretical stances with respect to the text-as-intended — to the text as a linguistic entity, rather than a set of squiggles or sound forms or brush strokes emptied of the very thing that makes them language in the first place — necessarily propose a notion of “interpretation” that most people would, when they found out what those underpinnings are, recognize as a threat to autonomy.

Again, I’m saddened that a group that evidently prides itself of intellectualism is so ready to dismiss me with self-serving nods to my physicality, or to my mode of rhetoric when it comes to dealing with those who, to be honest, have treated me as poorly as I’ve been treated in this thread.

Being haughtily dismissive and then following that up with a litany of jargon and a few well-placed name drops does not an argument or a discussion make.

If you have no desire to argue these things on the merits, just say so.  But don’t pretend you’ve done the more difficult work of fighting for your positions when  all you’ve really done is sought to diminish my credibility in order to maintain the kind of intellectual laziness that is all to prevalent in literary and textual studies these days.

I’ve come here in good faith to answer comments that were offered in a much different vein.

I’m going to repost on my site this rather lengthy, extemporaneously composed comment,  I invite Rich, Martin, and the others who claim an interested in textual analysis, interpretation, and how those jibe with intentionalism, to visit and give me the lashing I deserve.

As SEK now knows (but has yet to correct), I never banned him from my site.  I removed a trackback, noting I’d done so — which had the practical effect of letting everyone know a post existed that I didn’t want linked to my post.  

Here, a post has been removed altogether. And yet I don’t see SEK  writing about your hypocrisy or desire to chill his speech.

To those of you who read SEK’s original post, I’ll pose the same questions I posed to him:  where is the threat of violence?  He links to a comment of mine that hints of extralegal strategies for dealing with such nastiness aimed my way, but what he doesn’t tell you is that I had prior to that made it clear that I’d handle the situation like I always do:  namely, find and release the name of the anonymous commenter who publicly posted nasty lies about my family situation. My way of adding to internet “civility.”  Tough love, let’s call it.

Given that there are no instances of my having physically accosted anyone ever, and given that there are a number of instances where I’ve handled these situations in the way I describe, by what method of “textual analysis” did SEK arrive at this charge he’s leveled against me?  And doesn’t that matter?

Too, SEK leaves out key elements in the chronology of events.  Is this reframing of the historical narrative presented to get to the truth?  Or to help create a ground on which I’m to be indicted?

Again, does that not matter?

Can these techniques, whether out of sloppiness or malice, not be used against you?

SEK took down his own post.  To be honest, I’m not sure why, though I think it’s because he felt pressure from some commenters here.  That said, I shouldn’t speak for him.  Anyway, I believe the post is still up over at his place.  You can take a look for yourself.

“Like a perfect parody of academic writing.”

That’s good, since I’m not an academic.  Sadly your interpretive powers were not sufficient to detect that I was joshing SEK with my phrasing.  Although the connection to what Neiwert writes about is quite apt.

And no, I have no interest in commenting on your site.  You forget that people have seen an actual example of your interpretive method, the Ayers / Obama fling.  Nope, I’m not going to learn anything from anyone who could take that seriously; I’m only interested in why SEK took you seriously.

Rich and Urk,

I think I agree with what both of you are saying here, I’m just not sure that I’m agreeing with SEK, because I think he believes that what an author intended a text to say or how they intended it to function has some special meaning in its own right and that it’s our/his job to figure this out.

Rich, I’m certainly not arguing for a voluntaristic concept of meaning.  Some texts are more unresolvable than others (The kind of recursive narration that someone like Nawal El Saadawi does ensures that the text as a whole can’t be reduced to a singular meaning).  Like you said, texts are created by authors, and if they’re worth reading the author probably had a pretty good idea of how they wanted a text to function, but once they’re out in the world they’re their own thing.

Urk, that’s a really good point and I think it applies to literature as much as music (neither of which is my field, but historians do the jack of all trades thing).  Some of the most interesting stuff to come out the intersections of comparative literature and history in the last fifteen years (in African history, the work of Isabella Hofmeyer, Stephanie Newell and Derek Peterson is exemplary) has focused on communities (imagined and lived) of writers and readers in which literature is produced and consumed.

Urk, you’re saying it a lot smarter than I can today.  Have at it!

JPool, two quotes:

_And from a historical (and, I assume, historicist) perspective authorial intent would be relevant only to the extent that it, or various statements about it, circulated as one of the paratexts accompanying a work of fiction. What am I missing?_

And:

_I’m just not sure that I’m agreeing with SEK, because I think he believes that what an author intended a text to say or how they intended it to function has some special meaning in its own right and that it’s our/his job to figure this out._

Addressing the second first, I don’t think it’s our job to figure this out, it’s just what I’m interested in.  You know, the cultural transmission of ideas.  So, to make understandable the London reference above, in 1904 he tried to write a book that communicated his understanding of the Nietzschean Superman (_The Sea-Wolf_); in 1906, he tried again, only this time he wanted it inflected with a little more socialism (_The Iron Heel_).  How do I know that?  He was polite enough to write letters saying as much.  Edith Wharton obviously struggled with the evolutionary ideas available at the time, but wasn’t as polite as London, so sussing out whatever it was she did entails figuring out whatever it was she did it with.  We can only know what that was — that is, we can only know what she understood to be evolutionary theory — through figuring out what she meant to do with it.  I realize I’m four or five-orders removed from textual evidence, but I do my damnedest to let the texts speak for their authors (which is why my prospectus focused on Lamarckism, the dissertation itself non-Darwinian evolutionary theories).

I’ll organize this into a more coherent post tonight or tomorrow.

**[Rich Puchalsky](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com)**

					

		

But Urk is saying something different than what you’re saying, isn’t he, Scott?  Your description of what you’re interested in sounds like one aspect of the academic study of texts — using them as a means of studying the cultural transmission of ideas.  But that’s not usually what people mean when they talk about interpreting a text.  Keeping in mind that the text had an author who was part of a community of readers of similar texts (if the author was) seems different.

_I don’t think it’s our job to figure [out authorial intent], it’s just what I’m interested in. You know, the cultural transmission of ideas._   

Right, I think where I run into trouble is unstanding the connection of the first part to the second.  Your London example shows how you can figure out what he thought he was doing in revising his text (the authorial intent part), but it doesn’t explain why that would have mattered to the people reading his texts or if they even noticed (the cultural transmission of ideas part).  From this historian’s perspective, it feels like an uncomfortable slippage between (a certain kind of) intellectual history and (a certain kind of) cultural history, but maybe I’m projecting.  I’ll be interested to see the fuller post when it comes.

“Your London example shows how you can figure out what he thought he was doing in revising his text (the authorial intent part), but it doesn’t explain why that would have mattered to the people reading his texts or if they even noticed (the cultural transmission of ideas part).”

-but, is it a matter of his intent mattering to other people, or, is it a matter of our understanding of his intent informing to some (speculative) degree our understanding of their reading of the text because he and they are part of the process of the cultural transmission of ideas?  If the former, it’s a very limited case that only applies to certain kinds of known quantity author/audience relationships.  But if it’s the latter, i think it’s just a recognition of the fact that an author forms and communicates intentions based on some speculative, imprecise but not necessarily uninformed or irrelevant understanding of their (potential) audience.  And considering that the whole enterprise is a giant clutch of straws, it seems that these straws are worth looking after, less than some, more than others.

A lot of the issue here is to do with the whole question of why you care about the issue of “intent” in the first place. If you have an analytic philosophic interest, you’ll get into the x and o stuff about propositional content and so forth. Which is great — no snark, it is.

But then what if you have another project? (Eagerly  throwing past blog history over the boat) My interest in intentionalism was always kind of a side thing; I was interested in how Irish writers dealt with the problem of censorship. Censorship as a legal regime makes the issue of intent interestingly complicated; if you can’t say what you mean, or even say what you say you want to mean, how does anyone know what you mean? But they do! 

Long story short, I came to the idea that from an ethical point of view, you can’t dump intent when trying to decide what the hell a certain book means. But that’s like one rule among many for responsible scholarship; likewise, an important task is trying to reconstruct and understand the world in which such “intent” makes sense, in its often contradictory (or bizarre, or even drunken) valences. 

So I am most persuaded by the sort of approach Bourdieu takes in Rules of Art, that is, to see how the literary work fits in with all the other worlds with which it’s enmeshed. Whether this results in an all-size fits-all theory of meaning, I’m kind of agnostic. Whatever makes for a good, fun, scholarly, responsible, interesting result, you know? It’s all good.
