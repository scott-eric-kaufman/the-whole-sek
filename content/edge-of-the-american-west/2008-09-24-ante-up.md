Shouldn’t there be a muppets category here? I’m not objecting to “history and current events”, I’m just thinking of future generations.

I’m beginning to suspect that this entire blog is a piece of viral marketing from the Walt Disney Corporation.

How much is The Mouse payin’ you guys?

very impressive, and witty.

tho after the first minute of amusement at the juxtaposition, one is mostly left with the unrelieved dreariness of the soundtrack.

Unnamed monster # 1371

That’s some nice editing; hardly any cuts within a scene (though I suppose that floppy headed muppet speech makes it easier).
