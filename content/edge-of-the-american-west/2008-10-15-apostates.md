When Christopher Buckley “[bowed out](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-14/sorry-dad-i-was-fired)” of the magazine his father founded, _The National Review_, I expected there to be some blowback.  I didn’t expect it to be this bad—and I think tells us quite a bit about the tenor of the conservative mind at this particular historical moment.  [To wit](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-1/#comment-1526395):

Endorsing someone as far left as Obama is about as solid a repudiation of conservatism as you can get.  The argument for keeping him out of NR would be the same argument for a Christian Magazine keeping out a writer who endorsed Satan.

The logic is unimpeachable: McCain may not be Christ, but Obama’s certainly Satan.  Wait—did I write “unimpeachable”?  There’s peaches aplenty there.  [This](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-1/#comment-1526403) was the unimpeachable bit:


Obama did not write his own books; there’s every reason to believe that William Ayers “ghosted” most or all of them.

I kid, I kid.  It’s in the next sentence:

Obama is an Anti-American/Pro-Jihadi/Anti-Semitic/Anti-White Rascist Marxist Muslim FACT.

The commenter wrote _fact_ in all-caps.  I can see a lowly “fact” being reputed, but, by the foundational laws of typography, a “FACT’ is irrefutable.  [See](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526995)?

_NRO_ is one of the best sources for conservative thought on planet earth, and Buckley can go fly a kite, which under [Obama] he’ll have to obtain a federal and state license to own and operate. NOT KIDDING.

Wait—no it isn’t.  But this post is about Buckley, not Obama, and it is Buckley about whom a “BKennedy” (whose first name is no doubt “Bobby”) [writes](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-1/#comment-1526496):

Chris Buckley fails.  And his influency in English will backlash to hurt his dad’s magazine.

I know, I know: how many more fish can they stuff in that barrel, Scott?  But this post isn’t about barrels or even _The National Review_.  This post is about [elitism and elites](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-2/#comment-1526500):

hristopher Buckley and Heather MacDonald should mate, but have Michelle Obama offer to be the surrogate mother. Then Barack Obama can raise the child as if it were his own. They’ll name him John, in honor of Kerry, and in 30 years we’ll be blessed with the Perfect Snob.

This post is about us and them, with them [responding](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-2/#comment-1526548) to the above comment thus:

Typical black family.  LOL.

Which means this post is about [the Culture Wars](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-2/#comment-1526635):

I do know that we have NOT had 8 years of conservatism as [Buckley suggests]. And I know that electing an eloquent radical Marxist is not the way to advance the cause. It’s suicide. Good riddance to you, and Kristol, and McCain, and for that matter GWB. The hell with reaching across the aisle.  Where has it gotten us?  Until we recognize the enemy as the enemy, we will continue to be defeated.

Make that the _intra-conservative_ Culture War.  [To wit](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526710):

Christopher Buckley is another super-rich elitist, who can afford to behave and say whatever he wants.

No, I was right the first time.  This is about the Culture War, only the populists (such that they are) are throwing their intellectual elites (such that they are) overboard because the latter are [too centrist](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526731):

Look on the bright side[:] since McCain has failed to pick up the vaunted [independents] and moderates, perhaps no one else will be so hasty to try this strategy in the near future.

Why would they?  [After all](http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526761):

This is binary. A or B.

Which is why, in the post to which all these people are responding (as well as conservative sites in general these days) “nuance” is used as a term of opprobrium:

The gratuitous sneer about ideological diversity, as if The Nation or Salon was any better, makes me think his political leanings are a tad more _nuanced_ than he’s letting on, but if that’s the case then he probably shouldn’t have been given a column to begin with.

Because you can’t have nuance when everyone’s asked to pass “the litmus test.”

American conservatism eats its old.

All kidding aside, these people really do worry me.  There are so many of them, and they are so infuriated by reality when it disagrees with them, they simply reject it.  This is 20-30%!o(MISSING)f the American population.  I mean, WTF?  Where does a nation go with that fire-ant beswarmed millstone hanging around its neck?  

It’s the stupid, stupid.  The angry stupid.

I feel like the canonical example of ending a completely bats comment with an upper-case FACT has got to be somewhere on “[“Speak You’re Branes](),” but I apparently don’t have the search skills it would take to filter for capitalization.

You sort of have to admire someone who, after managing to stumble down a cul-de-sac of utter wrongheadedness, just doubles down with a FACT or a NOT KIDDING when surely the easy way out would be something like NOT LITERALLY OF COURSE BUT DAMNED IF IT DOESN’T FEEL THAT WAY SOMETIMES.

_This is 20-30%!o(MISSING)f the American population._ 

20-30%!o(MISSING)f the population _is_ plenty scary; that’s about the percentage of the public who are Bush Dead-enders.

But 20-30%!o(MISSING)f the population do not read America’s Shittiest Website®, let alone comment on it.

This country’s screwed up, but it’s not _that_ screwed up. And even the average Bush Dead-ender isn’t that obsessively nuts.

_This is 20-30%!o(MISSING)f the American population._

I have always assumed that about 10%!o(MISSING)f the population of any Western democracy are nutty in this way.  That’s about the percentage of the vote that people like Jean-Marie Le Pen get (and probably would in the US with a different political system that didn’t privilege two parties).  It’s when the vote gets much higher than that when the hand-wringing begins.

Buckley’s confession (it’s not really an endorsement in any meaningful sense) is interesting.  Like Brooks, it speaks in interesting ways to the contradictions in the Republican party: the uneasy alliance of economic conservatives, cultural conservatives and (the handful of) intellectual conservatives.  If you’re winning it’s a lot easier to put these differences to one side, than if you’re facing an impending loss.

It’s also striking because the more strategic thing would seem to be for them to treat Buckley the same way Dems were treating the imagined PUMA hordes, by trying to shame them into changing their votes.  “You find the new John McCain distasteful?  Well suck it up and fight for those tax cuts.”  (Or, whatever the ruling class says to each other.)  Instead they go idtastic and shout “Judas!” a lot.

As much as I am enjoying the spectacle, I would just like to say to Christopher Buckley: Fuck you, you fucking asswipe. \*Now\* do you understand the seething volcano of craziness and hate that people like you and your father tried to paper over while simultaneously bending it to your advantage? Cry me a fucking river, and then start working hard to help undo the damage you’ve helped do with your despicable lies and rancid intellectualizations. (Of course it doesn’t pay to go on like that on the Internet until after the election, so I won’t.)

_How could they not be, at this point in history, Ben? That’s a serious question._

Because most people in this country are less concerned with politics than you, me, or the crazies of the wingnutosphere.

They’re more worried about football or bass fishing or their families or their churches. And then once every couple years, they vote.  

And, yes, they basically buy into the general fearmongering about terrorism and the “gay agenda,” and are easily convinced that people like Barack Obama are elitists. Or they’re scared ’cause he’s black. And they feel they pay too high taxes, and the Republicans are for lower taxes, but the Democrats want higher taxes and want to take away their guns.  

But they haven’t given a lot of thought to whether or not Obama wrote his memoirs.  They probably still haven’t heard of Bill Ayers.  And they’re not obsessed with patrolling each other’s partisan or ideological purity.

I live in Oklahoma. It looks like McCain is going to win this state by around 30%! (MISSING)And Jim Inhofe will handily win reelection to the Senate. Yet Democrats still outnumber Republicans among Oklahoma. Our Governor, and most of our elected state constitutional officers, are Democrats.  Most Oklahomans are part of the 20-30%!o(MISSING)f the population we’re talking about. Yet many of those voters in this state are also Democrats.  Many Oklahoma voters are deeply politically ignorant and intolerant, but they’re not purists or ideological obsessives (though they will vote for purists and ideological obsessives like Inhofe, while also voting for bland centrists like our Governor, Brad Henry).

Let me give you an example. I have a neighbor who is a lifelong, rightwing Republican (I should say that my neighborhood is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic).  She really loves the fact that people in the neighborhood get along despite political differences. But she’s critical of those in the neighborhood who always want to talk politics because she thinks it divides people.

Now her politics–in terms of policies, party, and candidates–are probably very similar to the folks at NRO Online.  But in the way she handles dissent she’s profoundly different from them. And I’ve met a lot of people in Oklahoma like her.  Although one encounters plenty of Fundie intolerance in Oklahoma, one also encounters a lot of people who take a live-and-let-live attitude towards those who think differently from them.  Republican Party activists are pretty much as bad as you’d imagine them. But most people are not party activists.

If you tell Ben he’s right, he’s just going to want more cake.  Instead, whack him across the nose, hard, with a rolled-up newspaper.  That’ll teach ‘im.  But yes, he’s right.  My prescription?  Never read right-wing websites, watch FOX News, or listen to Rush.  Also, television cable news of all kinds.  All of that crap gets the blood angried up.

I know those Oklahoma Democrats, Ben.  (Not the specific ones in your neighborhood, but that larger population.)  They’re like the ones in Arkansas, Tennessee, etc.  They’re Democrats by tradition, but that’s about it.  By and large, they’re as conservative as any Republican anywhere.

As for your point that much of Bush’s 20-30%!s(MISSING)imply don’t follow politics that closely and don’t get into the fearmongering, they just follow it, I think this gets back to that essence vs. behavior thing.  I’ll retract my implication that they are crazies, when they vote with and for and otherwise support the crazies, it doesn’t much matter what they “are.”  Their civic behavior is what matters.

_Their civic behavior is what matters._

I agree. But their civic behavior includes more than just their votes in state and national elections.

Some actually vote on the right side of local issues.

But more importantly, civic behavior extends beyond voting.  And however awful their votes are, many are significantly better citizens than, say, Jeff Goldstein (to judge from his online civic behavior). 

And, Ari, I respond much better to positive reinforcement.  Get rid of that newspaper.  Use a clicker and treats.

Note also that we’re in the process of a generational shift in both parties.  This is the first election that I know of that has non-Vietnam-connected (i.e. who had no role in Vietnam at all–though I’m sure that Obama helped William Ayers lose the war) candidates on both tickets.

Part of the reason for the enthusiasm for Sarah Palin among the GOP base, I think, is that she is reflective of the newer population of Republicans (G\_d help us).  Same with Obama.

“the murder rate would be about 10 times higher than it is.”

yeah, or some other multiplier greater than 1. i agree.

what this shows about the effects of on-line discourse, i don’t know.

could be that it is degrading our ability to interact with those outside our own echo chamber, destroying our civic discourse.

or, could be that it is sparing us a lot of off-line murder.

i think yggles made this argument some time last year–that before we had flame-wars on the web, we had bar-fights and assault & battery. 

so long as people are able to switch dialects and decorum for the different environments, it may work out okay.

(in my own case, i certainly enjoy getting to use words on blogs that would be inconsistent with the dignity of my office in real life.

also, as an old man i enjoy keeping up with the new slang–i even know that i ought to have written ‘irl’ at the end of the last graf. being aware of internet traditions makes me a parasitic member of an in-crowd. 

i can’t pass for a young hipster in person–it’s just laughably incongruous. but on the web, i can try talking like one, and that gives me some sort of pleasure–perverse, but victimless.)

maybe there are three things: how you behave online (the goldstein issue), how you behave in real life (ben alpers’ neighbors), and how you behave in the voting booth.

i’m willing to believe that ben’s neighbors are far more decent in person than goldstein/nro/powerline are online. but so long as his neighbors vote ‘r’ in the voting booth, they are making possible the whole structure of wing-nut welfare that gives us the nros.

as well as giving us the policies that killed a million iraqis and stole 4 trillion dollars from our country. it’s just too damned easy, as a citizen of the u.s.a., to be a decent neighbor who facilitates global war-crimes, and never have the cognitive dissonance brought home to you.

_as well as giving us the policies that killed a million iraqis_

People who voted for Democratic Senators (a majority of whom supported the Iraq war resolution in October 2002) in 1996, 1998, and 2000 helped bring this about, too.

But I’m completely willing to believe that most Democrats are more decent than the policies their party has pursued over the last couple decades (which are, of course, less bad than the policies pursued by the Republican Party, which is why I tend to vote for Democrats).
