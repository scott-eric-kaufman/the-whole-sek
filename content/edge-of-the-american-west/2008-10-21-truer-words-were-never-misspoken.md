[Jonah Goldberg](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDk4MDFlM2E3ZjFlNDhjOTkzMDA4OTMyZDRkZjRiNWY=):

Her book is idiotic, irresponsible and grotesquely sweeping in ways mine doesn’t even come close to being.

I’m not sure which approach I want to take on this.  I’m torn between “But not for lack of trying, Jonah” and “You’re not giving yourself enough credit, my friend.”

I simply won’t give NRO traffic.  What book is he referring to?

Speaking of misspeaking, can’t the GOP find anybody to unseat Jack Murtha?  I mean, come on.  How hard can it be?  The guy’s a blue-ribbon jackass on the original pattern.

Reason magazine did a side by side [review of both books](http://reason.com/news/show/127429.html) a couple of weeks ago. I’ll never invest the time to read either book but I  would like like to see Wolf and Goldberg locked in a room and forced to debate. Of course, I’d settle for both of them being just locked in a room.
