(_**Up to the dating:** The stupid, it [along the lines of burns](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/proving-the-point-i-made-about-him-being-along-the-lines-of-a-rank-bigot-.html)!_)

Via someone named “[davenoon](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-beat-shit-out-of-some-kids-today-but.html),” I learn that someone named Dan Riehl recently encountered some black people who “[were technically _thugs_](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2009/09/a-912-experience-dangerous-times.html).”  What did these “technically _thug[gish]_” black people do?  “There was no confrontation,” Riehl informs his readers, but “there were maybe ten or so” of them in the bus, which is about nine or so more than is required to trigger a flight-or-flight response in folks like Riehl.  Somehow, he managed to keep it together long enough to hear what these “pretty young, not that big” black “kids” were saying, which he transcribed for the sensitive ears of his readers thusly:

Without resorting to the poor diction it was along the lines of, these are the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ.

Why these “pretty young, not that big [black kids who] were technically _thugs_” resorted along the lines of the poor diction Riehl employs is, I confess, a bit confusing.  Along the lines of this confusing is also why Riehl admits, mid-sentence, that he believes these black kids are “the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ.”  I could see along the lines of Riehl resorting to the transparent racism of equating Obama with the anti-Christ, but I can’t understand why he would attribute that belief to the “pretty young, not that big [black kids who] were technically _thugs_.”  

I believe the problem is that Riehl believes they are “technically _thugs_,” when clearly the problem is that they are only “_technically_ thugs,” meaning that they’re not thugs at all, but well-dressed young black conservatives on their way to celebrate Glenn Beck Day along with the likes of Dan Riehl.  But that is just me resorting to the good hypothesis about the poor diction without seeing what exactly what they said was along the lines of, which was this:

That McCain he wasn’t chit.

It seems Riehl needs glasses, because it sounds like he was seated in front of ten or so terrible caricatures of Latino gangstas or, given how poor his ear for dialogue is along the lines of, possibly the [Clay Davis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjh9Id6Id8) [family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QNB4wMH3PU) [reunion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QpWKu98h3I).  Fortunately for all involved, these kids who were only “_technically_ thugs” behaved as kids who are only “_technically_ thugs” do:

It went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed.

By “it,” Riehl means “they,” but don’t chalk that “it” up to poor diction: for Riehl and those like him, _all_ black kids, even when they’re “pretty young [and] not that big,” are “_technically_ thugs” and, as such, are undeserving of a pronoun that refers along the lines of people instead of things.
