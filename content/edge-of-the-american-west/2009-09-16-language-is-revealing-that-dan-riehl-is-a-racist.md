(_**Up to the dating:** The stupid, it [along the lines of burns](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/proving-the-point-i-made-about-him-being-along-the-lines-of-a-rank-bigot-.html)!_)

Via someone named “[davenoon](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-beat-shit-out-of-some-kids-today-but.html),” I learn that someone named Dan Riehl recently encountered some black people who “[were technically _thugs_](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2009/09/a-912-experience-dangerous-times.html).”  What did these “technically _thug[gish]_” black people do?  “There was no confrontation,” Riehl informs his readers, but “there were maybe ten or so” of them in the bus, which is about nine or so more than is required to trigger a flight-or-flight response in folks like Riehl.  Somehow, he managed to keep it together long enough to hear what these “pretty young, not that big” black “kids” were saying, which he transcribed for the sensitive ears of his readers thusly:

Without resorting to the poor diction it was along the lines of, these are the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ.

Why these “pretty young, not that big [black kids who] were technically _thugs_” resorted along the lines of the poor diction Riehl employs is, I confess, a bit confusing.  Along the lines of this confusing is also why Riehl admits, mid-sentence, that he believes these black kids are “the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ.”  I could see along the lines of Riehl resorting to the transparent racism of equating Obama with the anti-Christ, but I can’t understand why he would attribute that belief to the “pretty young, not that big [black kids who] were technically _thugs_.”  

I believe the problem is that Riehl believes they are “technically _thugs_,” when clearly the problem is that they are only “_technically_ thugs,” meaning that they’re not thugs at all, but well-dressed young black conservatives on their way to celebrate Glenn Beck Day along with the likes of Dan Riehl.  But that is just me resorting to the good hypothesis about the poor diction without seeing what exactly what they said was along the lines of, which was this:

That McCain he wasn’t chit.

It seems Riehl needs glasses, because it sounds like he was seated in front of ten or so terrible caricatures of Latino gangstas or, given how poor his ear for dialogue is along the lines of, possibly the [Clay Davis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjh9Id6Id8) [family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QNB4wMH3PU) [reunion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QpWKu98h3I).  Fortunately for all involved, these kids who were only “_technically_ thugs” behaved as kids who are only “_technically_ thugs” do:

It went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed.

By “it,” Riehl means “they,” but don’t chalk that “it” up to poor diction: for Riehl and those like him, _all_ black kids, even when they’re “pretty young [and] not that big,” are “_technically_ thugs” and, as such, are undeserving of a pronoun that refers along the lines of people instead of things.

						Along the lines of this confusing is also why Riehl admits, mid-sentence, that he believes these black kids are “the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ.”

I think you’re misreading Riehl here. He is saying that black kids are attributing this belief to the white folks riding with them. And the black kids are, allowing for hyperbole, surely correct.

Which still raises the question of why Riehl labels them thugs. Presumably because they employ disreputable literary techniques like hyperbole.

_I think you’re misreading Riehl here._

And _deliberately_, no less!  Yes, I’m misconstruing what he thinks he said, because he said it so poorly whilst along the midst of mocking other people’s diction, _i.e._ “Who’s down with O.P.D.?” “No, sir, not me!” “Who’s down with O.P.D.?” “Fuck no, not me!” &c.

_“Who’s down with O.P.D.?” “No, sir, not me!” “Who’s down with O.P.D.?” “Fuck no, not me!” &c._

I actually had to consult a tissue after the snort that produced. 

Flashbacks to Key West clubbing notwithstanding, I have to agree with you. The obsession with race in that article is a touch disturbing.

I see that Riehl has closed comments on this thread just after he posted an infantile rant. Sad. Truth doesn’t matter. Reality doesn’t matter. Pure, disethical (yeah, I just made up that dumb word, but it means something I want it to mean) sophistry.

Scott, you’re pulling your punches again. You left out one of the most perfectly garbled sentences ever attempted by a purported native speaker of the English Language (of blessed memory):

_I can’t say as I’m not concerned that America might not end up more racially divided than we’ve been in 30 years._

The most interesting idea, to me, is the notion “technically thug”. Such wording assumes a lot of things:  

\*In the mind of the writer, there is an objective, “technical” definition of “thug”.  

\*Such definition is employed in a “technical” sense, supposedly by experts in “thuggery”. (One wonders who these people are. The police?)  

\*The writer, himself, is not identifying with this group of experts, as he is not using that definition unselfconsciously but referring to it as “technical”.  

\*The writer recognizes that while “technically” correctly applied, the definition of “thuggishness” might be cover people who are not, actually, “thugs”.

Considering that most of us identify word “thug” with concepts like “mugger”, “cutthroat” or “robber”, I admire Riehl for his self-confidence. Not many of us would think that a few peaceful, law-abiding citizens can beat up about ten people who are  “technically” criminals accustomed to serious violence. Unless, of course, we were also accustomed to using serious violence against our neighbours.

I think that this apparent contradiction is most easily solved by noting that there actually is a “technical” definition of “thug”. It means a member of “Thuggee”, the network of Kali-worshipping fraternities, which, according to rumours, had the custom of performing human sacrifices in the 19th-century Northern India. So, you might think that a group of modern, devout Hindu youths dedicated to Kali-worship are “technically” thugs, while still feeling quite safe in their presence. So, this story is about an encounter with a group of Democratic Hindu youngsters.

Surely, this is the ideal forum to observe that if they were \*technically\* thugs, they’d be strangling people with silk scarves.  Since Riehl was presumably unstrangled at the time of writing, it seems likely that he is lying.

The idea of black religious conservatives believing Obama is the Antichrist isn’t actually that far-fetched (granted that they’re religious conservatives and believe all the crazy stuff religious conservatives generally believe).  According to some schools of thought the Antichrist is a counterfeit messiah, so if you believe the conservative talking points about welfare dependency, someone promising to help minorities but actually making them dependent on the government could seem a lot like a false messiah.

Or, to put it another way, you’re not an Antichrist unless you pretend to be helping people.  Obama is clearly either trying to help people, or pretending to help people, and if you are conservative enough to believe that government can’t genuinely help people, then the first theory is out.

Several commenters (including some on the right) have noted [the rise of the thug horde](http://cunningrealist.blogspot.com/2009/09/chimney-politics.html) narrative starting to come out of the right. This is an inelegant version of it, but echoes what is, I’m sure, the internal narrative of many on the right who can’t help but see race as both fundamental and divisive.

Because loudly insulting people in the third person tense is not at all meant to intimidate people is it? Where as white people who oppose Obama must be pearl clutching religious freaks. The idea that you Marxies have the gall to call anyone racists is beyond hypocrisy.

_The idea that you Marxies have the gall to call anyone racists is beyond hypocrisy._

You mean that no one should ever be called a racist, or that “Marxies” (whoever they are – Groucho and Harpo?) should never call anyone racist? And what is this undefined realm “beyond hypocrisy” called?

_Because loudly insulting people in the third person tense is not at all meant to intimidate people is it?_ 

When a white man declares that all young black men are, by definition, “technically _thugs_” (whatever, as Lurker points out, that means), calling him a racist isn’t an insult—it’s a statement of fact.  If racists don’t want to be called racists, they should try not to write things that reveal them to be racists.
