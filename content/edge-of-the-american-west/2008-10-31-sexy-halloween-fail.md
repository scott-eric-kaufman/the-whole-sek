## Sexy Halloween FAIL

The worst cold I’ve ever had?  The one that left me perched before a roomful of students, [unable to make words](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/post.html)?  I shared it with the wife.  So she’s spent her favorite holiday curled up on the couch “watching” [her favorite holiday special](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0019KAQEU/diesekoschmar-20) when she’s ripped from sleep by hack, cough or [Sukhee Kang](http://www.sukheekangformayor.com/accompl.htm).  (_Four calls so far today_!)  Like all decent people and ([irate dinosaurs](http://www.qwantz.com/archive/000874.html)), she abhors the sexification of Halloween:

Because the only thing she loves more than me is [one-third of Europe dead](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/syllabus\_bleg\_p.html), I dedicate [this Google failure](http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&q=%!s(MISSING)exy+plague+doctor%!&(MISSING)btnG=Search+Images) to her.  It’s comforting to know [some things](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Doktorschnabel\_430px.jpg) remain sacred.

That’s fabulous.  The next time I have to dress up — maybe after the kids are grown — I’m going to be a plague doctor.  Except with this mask:

My favorite thing about SEK is that half the time I’ve got no idea what the fuck he’s saying.

I’m going as Ashley Todd. Not sexy.

You should have your companion go as the specter of a large black man.

Sybil, that’s awesome. 

I am not doing anything on Halloween.

Didn’t mean to be opaque there: the wife loves plague and there are, as of now, no “sexy plague doctor” costumes out there.  I suppose it’s only a matter of time.

My comment wasn’t a veiled criticism.  I was serious.  Once I have time to go clicking on links, I’m sure all will be made clear.  But I sorta like the fact that I can’t quite tell what you’re talking about until I do go clicking.

It’s different from the usual case, where you can tell exactly what someone’s talking about and what they’re saying about it, with the links simply providing additional context or evidence or whatnot.

With you, I often can’t even tell what the subject under discussion is until I clicky clicky.  It’s like a puzzle.

Surely, The Little Womedievalist owns or knows of [my favorite tee shirt?](http://www.northernsun.com/n/s/1618.html)

I have yet to see a “Sexy History Prof” (TM) costume…

grackle, at some point, [Ancrene Wiseass](http://ancrenewiseass.blogspot.com/) linked to that very shirt, and the wife received one of ’em about a week later.  So yes, she’s a BD groupie.

urbino, I like my posts to be [like your namesake](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/index.html): “Which path leads to Raffaello’s birthplace?”  “I have to climb a brick ladder to get to [my hotel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicolocanestrari/2886993985/sizes/o/)?”  “The bar’s in the [bookstore](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sapo74/2743237295/sizes/o/), beneath [that building on the right there](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59436014@N00/1508414289/sizes/l/)?”\*

\*I think.  Urbino ain’t that big, but I sometimes confuse my plazas.  I only lived there two months, you know, and I spent one of them studying for my qualifying exams while my wife shacked with communists restoring medieval churches.

A bar in a bookstore is a fantastic idea.

That bookstore picture is hot, to boot.

Sadly, it’s not a bookstore _and_ a bar so much as a bookstore _then_ a bar.  The bookstore closes at 5 p.m., stuff’s moved around, then the bar opens at 8 p.m. with a line of liquor where the books used to be.  Granted, you delve deep enough into the bar—by which I mean, deep enough under the _palazzo ducale_—and you’ll be drinking in a booth comprised of bookshelves beneath an 800 year old courtyard with inlaid glass blocks the size of manholes . . . and did I mention how much I love Urbino?  I’ve tried and failed to write its Borges-esque awesomeness up properly, but maybe it’s time I tried again.  There’s a BLDGBLOG-worthy post in there, no doubt, if only I had half Geoffrey’s knack for architectural scenery.

Such attachment to the place!  One suspects you must have had an _Indian Summer_ experience there.  (Actually, it does sound/look quite awesome.)
