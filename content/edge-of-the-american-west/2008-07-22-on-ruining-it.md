## On ruining it

The oddest complaint I’ve read about _The Dark Knight_ is that its use of a philosophical stalwart, “the trolley problem,” makes the film predictable to a certain tribe of cinematic sophisticates — as if _all_ summer action films employ classic ethical problems and director Christopher Nolan’s execution was simply sloppy. High-minded as they’re meant to sound, such criticisms reveal the basic ignorance of the folks who mouth them: the purpose of stripping the problem of all context — of discussing “five people” or “a fat man” instead of “your Aunt Eloise” or “your dog Phil” — is to remove as much emotionally-charged information as can be removed from the larger ethical concerns under considerations.


Nolan deliberately presses against abstraction, dressing these bare philosophical bones with the accoutrements of character, then enlivening the situation by placing these characters in jeopardy. Knowing the various moral, ethical and political arguments about the trolley problem doesn’t _ruin_ the experience of _The Dark Knight_ any more than knowing how to play chess ruins your appreciation of an elegant endgame. (Unless, I suppose, you’re a fervert partisan of one proposed solution and Batman’s decisions disappointed you, in which case, take it up with him.)

If you want an example of too much knowledge _ruining_ something, consult the _Star Wars_ cycle — or whatever its legions call it — as George Lucas’ decisions to prequel _robs the only three decent films of all dramatic effect_. Consider the first-time viewer who decides, quite rationally, to begin watching the whatever-they-call-it with _Episode I_. In it, he learns Anakin Skywalker is quick-tempered but fundamentally decent-hearted. In _Episode II_ or _III_ — I’ve only watched them once and am not in a position to research fine points at the moment — he learns Anakin Skywalker _fathers twins_, one of whom is whisked away by some senatorial aide or whatever, the other to a small desert planet. I’m probably punting the details here, but it’s only because _I don’t care they’re irrelevant_. My point is future viewers of _Episodes IV_ won’t wonder who Obi-Wan _really_ is; won’t be surprised in _Episode V_ when Vadar is revealed to be Luke’s father; and will consider Vadar’s redemption in _Episode VI_ a return to form.

Lucas hasn’t added to his legacy, he’s added _spoilers_ to the only part of it worth preserving. A more interesting example comes from Iain M. Banks’ [_Consider Phlebas_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/031600538X/diesekoschmar-20), which comes from the “Death by Water” sectioned of T.S. Eliot’s _The Wasteland_:

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,  

Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell  

And the profit and loss.  

               A current under sea  

Picked his bones in whispers.  

As he rose and fell  

He passes the stages of his age and youth  

Entering the whirlpool.  

               Gentile or Jew  

O you who turn the wheel and look _to_ windward,  

Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you

Do you consider its titular allusion a spoiler?  For those who’ve read the novel, did it diminish your enjoyment?  Or is it obscure and/or clever enough to keep you guessing?

**ON-THE-HEELS UPDATE:** Not five minutes after posting, it occurs to me the better analogy between Lucas and Banks would be to the content of _Consider Phlebas_ rather than its title.  For those who haven’t read it, it’s the first in his series of Culture novels, but it’s told from the perspective of an opponent of “the Culture,” that vast, space-faring civilization whose idle, hedonistic citizens live dull utopian lives while sentient machines lift heavy objects.  The Culture’s reviled by Horza, the novel’s protagonist, because he believes it is only a matter of time before the sentient machines realize their human equals are intellectually limited, temporally finite meat.  This perspective is justified given the events and behaviors documented in _Consider Phlebas_, but subsequent novels reveal it to be an error born of Horza’s restricted purview.  Not that there aren’t seedy elements within the Culture, only that they’re not what outsiders — readers included — assume them to be.

Point being, the transition from the first Culture novel to the next is supposed to be a jarring shift in philosophical and narratological perspective — except no one reads _Consider Phlebas_ first, because it’s been out of print for years.  So when I read it yesterday, I couldn’t help but be underwhelmed, as I recognized Banks setting up his “GOTCHA!” but didn’t get to _experience_ it.

**EDITED:** To reflect I transcribe badly.
