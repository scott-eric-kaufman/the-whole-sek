## On ruining it

The oddest complaint I’ve read about _The Dark Knight_ is that its use of a philosophical stalwart, “the trolley problem,” makes the film predictable to a certain tribe of cinematic sophisticates — as if _all_ summer action films employ classic ethical problems and director Christopher Nolan’s execution was simply sloppy. High-minded as they’re meant to sound, such criticisms reveal the basic ignorance of the folks who mouth them: the purpose of stripping the problem of all context — of discussing “five people” or “a fat man” instead of “your Aunt Eloise” or “your dog Phil” — is to remove as much emotionally-charged information as can be removed from the larger ethical concerns under considerations.


Nolan deliberately presses against abstraction, dressing these bare philosophical bones with the accoutrements of character, then enlivening the situation by placing these characters in jeopardy. Knowing the various moral, ethical and political arguments about the trolley problem doesn’t _ruin_ the experience of _The Dark Knight_ any more than knowing how to play chess ruins your appreciation of an elegant endgame. (Unless, I suppose, you’re a fervert partisan of one proposed solution and Batman’s decisions disappointed you, in which case, take it up with him.)

If you want an example of too much knowledge _ruining_ something, consult the _Star Wars_ cycle — or whatever its legions call it — as George Lucas’ decisions to prequel _robs the only three decent films of all dramatic effect_. Consider the first-time viewer who decides, quite rationally, to begin watching the whatever-they-call-it with _Episode I_. In it, he learns Anakin Skywalker is quick-tempered but fundamentally decent-hearted. In _Episode II_ or _III_ — I’ve only watched them once and am not in a position to research fine points at the moment — he learns Anakin Skywalker _fathers twins_, one of whom is whisked away by some senatorial aide or whatever, the other to a small desert planet. I’m probably punting the details here, but it’s only because _I don’t care they’re irrelevant_. My point is future viewers of _Episodes IV_ won’t wonder who Obi-Wan _really_ is; won’t be surprised in _Episode V_ when Vadar is revealed to be Luke’s father; and will consider Vadar’s redemption in _Episode VI_ a return to form.

Lucas hasn’t added to his legacy, he’s added _spoilers_ to the only part of it worth preserving. A more interesting example comes from Iain M. Banks’ [_Consider Phlebas_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/031600538X/diesekoschmar-20), which comes from the “Death by Water” sectioned of T.S. Eliot’s _The Wasteland_:

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,  

Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell  

And the profit and loss.  

               A current under sea  

Picked his bones in whispers.  

As he rose and fell  

He passes the stages of his age and youth  

Entering the whirlpool.  

               Gentile or Jew  

O you who turn the wheel and look _to_ windward,  

Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you

Do you consider its titular allusion a spoiler?  For those who’ve read the novel, did it diminish your enjoyment?  Or is it obscure and/or clever enough to keep you guessing?

**ON-THE-HEELS UPDATE:** Not five minutes after posting, it occurs to me the better analogy between Lucas and Banks would be to the content of _Consider Phlebas_ rather than its title.  For those who haven’t read it, it’s the first in his series of Culture novels, but it’s told from the perspective of an opponent of “the Culture,” that vast, space-faring civilization whose idle, hedonistic citizens live dull utopian lives while sentient machines lift heavy objects.  The Culture’s reviled by Horza, the novel’s protagonist, because he believes it is only a matter of time before the sentient machines realize their human equals are intellectually limited, temporally finite meat.  This perspective is justified given the events and behaviors documented in _Consider Phlebas_, but subsequent novels reveal it to be an error born of Horza’s restricted purview.  Not that there aren’t seedy elements within the Culture, only that they’re not what outsiders — readers included — assume them to be.

Point being, the transition from the first Culture novel to the next is supposed to be a jarring shift in philosophical and narratological perspective — except no one reads _Consider Phlebas_ first, because it’s been out of print for years.  So when I read it yesterday, I couldn’t help but be underwhelmed, as I recognized Banks setting up his “GOTCHA!” but didn’t get to _experience_ it.

**EDITED:** To reflect I transcribe badly.

I believe that’s [“look _to_ windward”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look\_to\_Windward)….

Since I don’t know the book, I can’t guess what that would spoil.  But generally, there’s a big difference between a proleptic spoiler, where an earlier part of the narrative undermines your interest in a later part, and a merely allusive one.  Unless the book is a mystery, I don’t find that a bit of paraphrasable knowledge “from the future” damages it much.  Otherwise repeated viewings, etc.

Which blog to comment on?  This one, I guess, since I didn’t read your add-on before commenting on the other one.  I don’t think that Banks was really planning for the shift from one book to the next that you refer to.  _Use of Weapons_ was written first, although not published first, and both of them were rewritten before being published, so I don’t know whether he was always planning for them to come out in the order they did.  Also, every Culture book has some attempt to get you to see some seedy elements in the Culture, due probably to an authorial feeling that readers would get bored with a straight utopia.

Maybe you were just underwhelmed by _Consider Phlebas_ because it’s not one of his best books?  It has a few too many straight space-opera scenes for my taste.

It’s not a trolley problem, it’s the prisoner’s dilemma.

Well, it’s not a perfect example of the PD, since the Joker says he’ll blow both ships up at midnight, so there isn’t really a reward for coöperating with one’s counterpart.  But it fits that better than it does the trolley problem.

It’s not really a trolley problem.

Batman doesn’t have to kill Dent to save Dawes, or kill Dawes to save Dent.   He has to make a decision between the two, but that’s just a dilemma.

The people on the ships don’t really meet the trolley problem, either.  It’s not a case of kill one ship to save the other, because as ben notes, the Joker’s going to blow them up at midnight.

Anyhow, that’s not the right criticism of Lucas, because surely we geeks have watched the original _Star Wars_ trilogy more than once, and they were not spoiled simply because we knew how they would end.  The right criticism is that the mitichlorian Force bullshit ruined whatever mythology the movies had been developing, because detecting Jedis by a blood test is so, so dumb.

No, it’s not the trolley problem.  Furthermore, the trolley problem is so decontextualized and abstract that it doesn’t make any sense to anyone who’s not a philosopher — there’s nothing in it that relates to any conceivable real-life situation, even if “real life” is stretched to include fantast movies.

Never heard of the trolley problem before, but at the time I considered it a sort of prisoner’s dilemma, each side had an advantage in screwing the other first, and they each stood the chance of a more severe loss if they gave the other the benefit of the doubt. If they both cooperated, however, there was a chance for them to come out ahead.

I’m not convinced that _Consider Phlebas_ is setting up any kind of gotcha. The story is told in ironic mode: the reader may empathize with the hero Horza for his bravery, endurance and determination but is surely never in any doubt that Horza is on the wrong side in the war. This is made clear from chapter one, which contrasts Horza’s murder and impersonation of a government minister with Culture agent Balveda’s honest and open diplomacy. Surely this irony (which only deepens as the novel goes on) undercuts the possibility that Banks intended the reader to take seriously Horza’s beliefs about the human–machine relationship in the Culture?

(_Spoilers follow._)

_Batman doesn’t have to kill Dent to save Dawes, or kill Dawes to save Dent. He has to make a decision between the two, but that’s just a dilemma._

First, it takes this almost imageless page about 10 minutes to load, so I didn’t provide examples of people who thought they saw the trolley problem, but I read them last week.  I think John Wilkins, the Australian evolution/philosopher guy, linked to them.  The way these folks set it up was that Dent was the five people on one track — superficially more important — whereas Dawes was the single person tied to the other.  Batman had to decide to save more lives, or the more important one.  It becomes the trolley problem by virtue of their relative importance in Batman’s professional vigilante crusade.

But my larger point, though, is that it doesn’t matter whether it’s the trolley problem or not, because narrativizing abstract scenarios is a messy process _by design_, mucking up all the neatness of philosophical discourse with irrational, contextualized emotion.

_“fervert”_

The words on my screen are very tiny.  And I don’t have Firefox, so I’m not aletred whne I mispell smoething!  (Can’t download it neither, as that would take days.)

_I don’t think that Banks was really planning for the shift from one book to the next that you refer to. Use of Weapons was written first, although not published first, and both of them were rewritten before being published, so I don’t know whether he was always planning for them to come out in the order they did. Also, every Culture book has some attempt to get you to see some seedy elements in the Culture, due probably to an authorial feeling that readers would get bored with a straight utopia._

I knew he’d rewritten both prior to publication, which is why I assumed the shift was intentional and thought he meant to jar the sensibilities he created in _CP_.  As for him worried about becoming boring, well, isn’t that ungenerous?  I’d wager he was up to some larger critique about the necessary seediness of even the most technologically advanced utopian societies.  It’s a defeatist philosophy — especially as seen in _The Player of Games_, where the main character’s disgust at the seediness of his home planet is undercut by the narrator’s identity and the lengths it went to orchestrate the events in the novel.  

_It has a few too many straight space-opera scenes for my taste._

It did, but when I was reading the final one, I kept being reminded of _The Iron Council_: something about alien societies and 19th century imperilment is just attractive to the SF crowd.  

_the reader may empathize with the hero Horza for his bravery, endurance and determination but is surely never in any doubt that Horza is on the wrong side in the war._

I don’t think so.  Despite knowing the Culture to be the more preferable form of civilization from having read other books in the series — and I say this having finished the book yesterday, so these thoughts are fresh _and_ inchoate — there’s a real appeal to Horza’s complaints about the Culture.  Technophobia may not pass muster for those of us who write and comment on blogs, but there’s a point at which many people throw their hands in the air and cry “ENOUGH!”  Tedium, as anyone who’s ever been materially comfortable but clinically depressed, is vicious even if the world runs damn near perfectly.

_there’s a real appeal to Horza’s complaints about the Culture_

But does Banks intend the reader to take this appeal so seriously that the revelation in the later books that Horza’s complaints are unjustified amounts to a deliberate “gotcha”?

This seems rather far-fetched to me, since Banks undercuts many of Horza’s complaints within _Consider Phlebas_ itself, which ought to make the reader suspicious of Horza’s other judgments.

There has to be _some_ appeal to Horza’s personal justifications — if there were none then we would have nothing but contempt for him and the novel wouldn’t work so well. It’s from the conflict between his heroic (if vicious) character and his tragically misguided political alignment that the story gets its interest. (For me, anyway.)

I agree with Gareth Rees.  Horza isn’t  the kind of person who sits around and feels clinically depressed while the world goes too well — he’s the kind of person who rebels from his home culture (if I remember rightly) and travels around killing people.  His justification for being on the Idiran side is just a bit too self-justifying, without being unsympathetically so; he doesn’t want to be in a world where people like him don’t get to think of their actions as being important.

In my copy of _Consider Phlebas_ there is a piece of the poem.  I don’t think that Banks thought that the title would be a spoiler.  Heck, it is a Banks book, the odds of the protagonist living are, what?, 50%!?(MISSING)

The only book that might depend on reading most of the Culture sequence first would be _Look to Windward_, which is a sequel of a sort for _Consider Phlebas_ and has a character which is a reflection of Horza, but an opposite as well.

The ferries seems to be more prisoners dilemma but killing the accountant to stop the hospital explosion is the trolley problem.
