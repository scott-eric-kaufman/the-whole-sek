From the live-blogging of the Oscars at _Big Hollywood_, I present the themes of the evening:

Ready to deliver careless ridicule and remarks I will later regret…

**[That’s a Lot of Middle-Aged Chick Skin](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dtennapel/2009/02/22/thats-a-lot-of-middle-aged-chick-skin/)**

by Doug TenNapel

If you’re in your early 50s and you’ve breast-fed your 1.5 children you adopted from Chinafrica, please wear more clothes. I thought for a second this was the SAG awards.

by                   **** Bill Willingham 

No, Stage Right, I predict same sex marriage won’t be mentioned once. It’s called “freedom of marriage” now. Managing the language is the be all and end all of newspeak.

Think these social conservatives won’t spend the entirety of the evening saying embarrassing things about breasts and gay marriage?  Think otherwise:

**[[no title]](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/mlong/2009/02/22/58094/)**

by Mike Long

If Kate Winslet wins for The Reader, will there be separate awards for each of her breasts? Cos that’s pretty much what that picture was about . . .

**[What I Want to Say](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/mlong/2009/02/22/what-i-want-to-say/)**

by Mike Long

My lesson learned about live blogging:  There’s the stuff you WANT to say . . . and the stuff you think you better not say . . .

by Tim Slagle

BEST ACTRESS is basically a topless contest between Kate Winslet and Marisa Tomei[.]

**[Oh. My.](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jude/2009/02/22/oh-my/)**

by Jude

Meryl Streep’s daughter is making me re-think my politics.

IS THERE A BETTER NAME FOR THE GUY HOSTING THE GAYEST EVENT IN THE WORLD THAN JACKMAN?

Kate Winslet ranges all the way from partial to full frontal nudity.

Anyone notice the double entendre from the script for “Milk?” “Harvey lifts the bullhorn to his lips.” Ahem.

Meh, the Milk speech. “One day you’ll have equal rights?” You DO have equal rights!!! There is nothing that straight people can do that you can’t do, and vice versa. Straight people aren’t allowed to marry members of the same sex either.

where did [Sarah Jessica Parker] get those???

I think “The Duchess” was a working title for “Milk.”

**[Sarah Jessica Parker . . .] (http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bshapiro/2009/02/22/sarah-jessica-parker/)**

by Ben Shapiro

The ugliest woman ever to become a Hollywood star.  Including Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.

by Tim Slagle

Only three nominees for best makeup?

What about the guy who made Meryl Streep look like a woman?

**[Technical award II](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/rlconover/2009/02/22/technical-award-ii/)**

Sarah Jessica Parker just won Best in Show.

And [I want to see] Marisa Tomei—topless!

**[Uh oh](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jhudnall/2009/02/22/uh-oh-2/)**

Methinks future Oscar romance montages will be filled with gay images from now on.

Didn’t they have anything more form-fitting for Miss Beale?

Milk kiss. Gross!

**[[no title]](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dtennapel/2009/02/22/60518/)**

by Doug TenNapel

My children and I have now seen more men kissing tonight than married heterosexual couples. That’s kind of every night on TV, though.

**[I’m not a prude . . .] (http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/sright/2009/02/22/im-not-a-prude/)**

by Stage Right

But, it’s 6:45 and my 9 year old and 7 year old girls are watching this with me and they just saw two men kissing on the lips.

Why do I have to deal with this?

**[[no title]](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dtennapel/2009/02/22/60606/)**

by Doug TenNapel

Can we please have an Oscar show that is just three hours of men kissing?

**[Curious Case](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/rlconover/2009/02/22/curious-case/)**

by Rodney Lee Conover

Meryl Streep is definitely aging **forward**.

by John Nolte

Doug, I know [you wrote this] (http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dtennapel/2009/02/22/show-us-your-talents/)a few hour hours ago when the show started . . .

Let’s face it, the BEST ACTRESS is basically a topless contest between Kate Winslet and Marisa Tomei.

. . . but I was just curious about the context. Are you saying that like it’s a bad thing?

**[[no title]](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/mlong/2009/02/22/63298/)**

by Mike Long

what’s with the stupid you-go-girl speeches, actress to actress? this is like some sort of support group where every chick ends up in sync with each other’s period . . .

**[[no title]](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/sright/2009/02/22/63730/)**

by Stage Right

Oh Boy . . . here comes Prop 8 the musical all over again.

I decided not to include all the entries which consisted of variations of the title of [this link](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/ggraham/2009/02/22/meghan-mccain-you-are-hot/)—because the daughter of the Republican’s most recent candidate for President deserves better than the company her father panders to.  (Or not.)  But what really worries me about this all is that it might give lie to the idea that Kathryn Jean Lopez doesn’t deserve the title of “editor.”  Because if _this_ is what they write off-the-cuff . . .

For some reason, my response to this comes from the same emotional place as my response to the Congressional Republicans and that crazy CNBC stockbroker who ranted about the mortgage bailout.  It’s like the far right has just decided that nothing has changed, and they aren’t going to care if they become increasingly disconnected from where the rest of the country is.  In a way, I am happy about this kind of behavior, because it means that they are on a path to make themselves entirely marginal.  I mean, can you really take the House Republican Caucus seriously after all of that grandstanding — as though conservative policies had nothing to do with the shitstorm we are in?  Can you really take seriously a blogger who has chosen to watch the Oscars but who is offended by two men kissing?  On the other hand, like a true sappy liberal, I want to believe that we all have better selves that are, finally, capable of some humility and sympathy.  So much for that.

For a minute I thought you were doing the “shorter” thing, but a few spot checks (I don’t have the stomach for more) reveals that you are, in fact, quoting them. Fully and accurately.

I’m flabbergasted. 

I’ve met fifth graders with more class (and better jokes).

Sorry I did laugh at a few, even with the cruelty. But then the line about “Jackman” and “the gayest event” reminded me of a group of perverts and pedophiles of varied sexual persuasions and perversions that’s lead by someone named BOEHNER. They could easily put on a floor show tap dancing in diapers and probably have.

Somehow they don’t seem to have grasped a basic point of this internet thing, which is that you’re not having a private conversation with a small group of like-minded friends–the whole world, including your mother, gets to see your boorish comments.

**Michael Turner**

					

		

Yeah, they seem to think the internet is conservative talk radio. where it’s like you’re having a private conversation with a small group of like-minded friends–and the whole world, including your mother, gets to _hear_ your boorish comments.

They tell their mothers that it’s just entertainment.  You know, the guys who bite the heads off live chickens have mothers too.  At least no chickens were harmed in the production of this sorry spectacle.

I’ve been reading a certain amount of the theory of Laughter (with a view to teaching a course about it next year).  It occurs to me that one problem with this notoriously problematic field is that any theory needs to account for Oscar Wilde, Jacques Tati _and_ people saying ‘breasts!’ and ‘men kissing!’ and guffawing like baboons.

I’m still not seeing why these people aren’t more successful artists and entertainers.  I have to think the gay breasted Hollywood mafiosi are blacklisting them.

_I’m still not seeing why these people aren’t more successful artists and entertainers._

They’re too busy serving as the backbone of the moral majority, obviously.

I wrote this post without comment because, honestly, I’m not sure what to say.  The comments above about them not realizing that the world can read what they’ve written pretty much nails it, though.  I’m sure they’ll be arguing about the sexualization of their children next week, bemoaning about sex ed. or something without a wink of cognitive dissonance.

There appears to be some flaw in the coding of trackback comments: a missing divider of some sort. It’s been quite consistent for a while now.

The most (ok, only) interesting aspect of Big Hollywood for me is Bill Willingham’s involvement, because he writes,a href=”http://www.amazon.com/Fables-Vol-1-Legends-Exile/dp/1563899426/ref=pd\_bbs\_sr\_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235517147&sr=8-1″&gt; a great comic book.  And I always knew he was a conservative, and didn’t care, because he wrote comic books, not punditry.  But now that I’m reading his political commentary, it’s starting to complicate the way I read his comic books, esp. the gender relations therein.
