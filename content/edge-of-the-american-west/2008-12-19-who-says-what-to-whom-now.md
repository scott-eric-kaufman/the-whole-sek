Mark Helprin—author of my [favorite novel](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156001942/diesekoschmar-20) when I was a naive fourteen—published [another](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122965053466920579.html) well-written, ur-conservative editorials in the _Wall Street Journal_ today.  You can (and will) disagree with the sentiment, but you must admit that the man can control his clauses:

The pity is that the war could have been successful and this equilibrium sustained had we struck immediately, preserving the link with September 11th; had we disciplined our objective to forcing upon regimes that nurture terrorism the choice of routing it out with their ruthless secret services or suffering the destruction of the means to power for which they live; had we husbanded our forces in the highly developed military areas of northern Saudi Arabia after deposing Saddam Hussein, where as a fleet in being they would suffer no casualties and remain at the ready to reach Baghdad, Damascus, or Riyadh in three days; and had we taken strong and effective measures for our domestic protection while striving to stay within constitutional limits and eloquently explaining the necessity—as has always been the case in war—for sometimes exceeding them.

The children [on the] (http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFhYzM0OGM0MjAyYTc0ZWUzMjljMDVhZDlmMzQzNzY=)_[Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFhYzM0OGM0MjAyYTc0ZWUzMjljMDVhZDlmMzQzNzY=)_ think otherwise.  According to Peter Wehner, Helprin’s editorial is both wrong _and_ chock-full of “very sloppy writing.”  The above soundly refutes the sloppiness argument, but you should know better than to expect sound arguments from people who think “Charles Krauthammer [is] America’s best columnist and one of our finest  geopolitical thinkers.”  My favorite bits:

This is an example of  very sloppy writing on the part of _Helprin_…

I gather that _Helprin_ is lamenting the fact that we did not attack Iraq immediately after 9/11.  But we could barely attack Afghanistan immediately after September 11, 2001, and Afghanistan required a strategic innovation that _Halperin_ totally ignores…

Reading between the lines, his use of the word “eloquently” probably translates into “we need more speeches written by Mark _Halperin_.” It’s worth recalling, then, that _Helprin_’s most notable speechwriting achievement to date was penning Robert Dole’s 1996 acceptance speech, arguing that Dole would be our Bridge to the Past. The speech was a bust, and helped contribute to Dole’s loss to Bill Clinton…

_Helprin_ is right that many Democrats have been feckless.  But if everyone from George W. Bush to Democrats have been feckless—and surely _Helprin_ would throw in every other global ally on that spectrum, too—then _Halperin_ is saying everybody, but him, has got it wrong. This is akin to the man on the highway who is going the wrong way and talks to his wife on the phone about how many morons are going the wrong way.

However would he know what _that_ feels like?
