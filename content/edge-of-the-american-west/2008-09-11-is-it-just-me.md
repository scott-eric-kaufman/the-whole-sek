Mazel tov.  Tell your second reader to give me a call.  S/he and I should have a quick chat about professionalism and power relationships.

You helped me with my Third Reader, not my Second.  My Second Reader has a point, it’s just one I wish s/he’d informed me of before, you know, the end.  If it weren’t for the elation, I’d sort of be upset about it.  But, you know, ELATION!

Nope, I was talking about your second reader.

I shaved my beard, wait, hold on, how did you know I did that?  Not that [didn’t think about cutting my hair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoMdkyeZOqE), but I don’t think I can really make him\* change.\*\*

I was thinking he might catch him in the parking lot and whack him upside his head with a ream of copy paper.  It’s like a telephone book — no marks.

Yay! The submission hassles do seem to be par for the course, and they’ve given you a good story, but sorry your second reader was such a complete dick. I could only bear to have a drink with 50%!o(MISSING)f my committee by the time it was over. These people, I don’t know.

Congrats, Dr. SEK, BA, MA, PhD.  Now resolve to Not Do Unto Future Candidates what was done unto you by Reader #2.  Unless the little tyro is really asking for it.

So, speaking of submission/filing hassles, and Scott’s mention of his margins being messed up, what’s the deal with ultra-strict guidelines on such things as margins and spacing and whatnot? Did Big Caliper convince universities that unless all their dissertations were standardized, no one would read any of them, or something?

**md 20/400**

					

		

Margin requirements are either the M&Ms of the academic world or Kate Turabian’s—and all other dissertation secretaries—eternal revenge.  (Or something to do with finance.)

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

It’s because they have to bind them, so you need a cheating-undergraduate right margin.

Congratulations!  I have no memories of actually turning in my dissertation.  I recall being very elated about life for about a month, though.  I hope your “bounce” lasts a little longer….

Yeah, but that doesn’t affect the offset at the bottom of the text before footnotes begin, or whatever.

many, many congratulations.

i’m very happy for you.

believe it or not, this is actually the outcome that irascible old academics want to see. it actually counts as a happy day from our side of the desk, too.

just as parents sometimes seem as though they are intentionally blocking your future and fucking up your life? but actually they want you to grow up and be independent and happy.

so, i mean, at least some of your profs?  they are very happy for you today. i am, even tho i’m not one of your profs.

And while I am happy for you, I also really do want to block your future and fuck up your life.  That’s just how I roll.
