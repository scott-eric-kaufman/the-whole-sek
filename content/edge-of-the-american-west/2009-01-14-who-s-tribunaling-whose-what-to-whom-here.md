## Who’s tribunaling whose what to whom here?

Yesterday, I [was reminded](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/better-to-be-forgotten-than-remember-quite-so-fondly.html) of the odious John Ziegler, for whom David Foster Wallace’s suicide was a [once-in-a-lifetime self-promotional opportunity](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/).  “Which act offended me more?” I asked myself.  Ziegler attacking Wallace’s “[Host](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200504/wallace)” the day his death was announced, or the anonymous student Horowitizing about grades in a professor’s memorial?  

Offense being an unlimited resource, I decided not to choose.  The desire [never to waste brain](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/#22297) on John Ziegler again factored heavily into my decision, but then I read the [_Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/nyregion/13nyc.html?\_r=1&em) and learned that the world [conspires against me](http://www.howobamagotelected.com/).  Want more proof?  Click around that very-professional-from-the-look-of-it-website and [you land in my new least favorite place](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jziegler/2009/01/14/reaction-to-my-palin-interview-proves-the-point/), where you learn that

[t]he Governor’s measured, rational and accurate attempts to correct the historical record about the basis for which a Presidential election was decided were “reported” by the left as being “whiny,” “catty” and “delusional.” Folks, there’s a reason why there’s such a thing as a war crimes tribunal; some things you just have to get to the bottom of.

Finally, a prominent-ish conservative who understands the need for a war crimes tribunal—wait, _what_?

_the world conspires against me_

Or: I can’t help myself.  How would you compare the import of this stuff to, say, the [death of the exclusionary rule](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/washington/15scotus.html?hp)?

Vance, Tom Goldstein [agrees with you](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/the-surpassing-significance-of-herring/#more-8528) about the importance of this case, so you’re probably right.  That said, when I first heard about it back in February, I was confused about why the principle of U.S. v. Leon, a 1984 case which I’m ambivalent about, couldn’t be pretty directly extended to cover this case.  There are factual differences, and like I said Goldstein is probably right (because he’s smarter than me), but I still take that position.

Before I saw Vance’s comment, what I was planning to say is: SEK, did you see the Daily Show [response](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=215906&title=blamey-whinehouse) to clips from howobamagotelected?  Because if not, worthwhile.

I’m no lawyer — I was just reaching for the example of Real Right-Wing Threat that lay nearest to hand.

But do you play one on TV, Vance?

I’m afraid that would require wearing a suit.

Your first sentence is missing a copula.

From the _Times_ article:  

the court’s majority came to a conclusion that will most likely please those who complain about criminals going free on “technicalities” and alarm those who fear that the high court is looking for ways to narrow the reach of the exclusionary rule.

As one who is adamantly opposed to narrowing the reaches of rules, this alarms me very much indeed.

Really? All rules? It seems to me there’s a case to be made for the value of this specific rule. And if the defenders of law and order want to avoid losing cases on technicalities, the simple solution is to follow the damn rule. (In the case at hand, that means for one thing that when the warrant in question was withdrawn, the entry in the computer system should have been cleaned up automatically.)

I am also opposed to humor.

And the kind of sloppy writing that would paint the dispute as one between a party with important substantive concerns (criminals going free omg!), and a party with silly procedural ones (they’re narrowing our precious rule!).
