Yesterday, I [was reminded](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/better-to-be-forgotten-than-remember-quite-so-fondly.html) of the odious John Ziegler, for whom David Foster Wallace’s suicide was a [once-in-a-lifetime self-promotional opportunity](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/).  “Which act offended me more?” I asked myself.  Ziegler attacking Wallace’s “[Host](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200504/wallace)” the day his death was announced, or the anonymous student Horowitizing about grades in a professor’s memorial?  

Offense being an unlimited resource, I decided not to choose.  The desire [never to waste brain](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/#22297) on John Ziegler again factored heavily into my decision, but then I read the [_Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/nyregion/13nyc.html?\_r=1&em) and learned that the world [conspires against me](http://www.howobamagotelected.com/).  Want more proof?  Click around that very-professional-from-the-look-of-it-website and [you land in my new least favorite place](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jziegler/2009/01/14/reaction-to-my-palin-interview-proves-the-point/), where you learn that

[t]he Governor’s measured, rational and accurate attempts to correct the historical record about the basis for which a Presidential election was decided were “reported” by the left as being “whiny,” “catty” and “delusional.” Folks, there’s a reason why there’s such a thing as a war crimes tribunal; some things you just have to get to the bottom of.

Finally, a prominent-ish conservative who understands the need for a war crimes tribunal—wait, _what_?
