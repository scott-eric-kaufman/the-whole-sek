## When the blog explodes, we’ll blame it on a temporal anomaly

As I logged in to write a serious post, I was greeted by the following announcement:

[![blogexplodenow](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/blogexplodenow.jpg?w=490 "blogexplodenow")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/blogexplodenow.jpg)

I say we fire a [chroniton beam](http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Chroniton) at it and see what happens.

Don’t be too hasty.  An antichronitron might be more effective.

I think someone’s been firing them at me.

Silly, this isn’t a bad thing, this is a good thing! The magic folks at WordPress have managed to shorten two days into less than 6 hours!  

This incredible invention will allow me to actually meet deadlines, on occasion! Huzzah!

“a type of particle which is an expression of time”

An expression of time? So, “oh no, it’s 11 PM” — was that a chroniton? I’ll need some help comprehending the “anti-time” bit, though.

Personally, I’m surprised there’s such a thing as a smallest possible unit of time.  Nothing on Star Trek is weirder than quantum fizziks.

If this blog were to perish twice, implosion would too suffice.

Sure, there can be a smallest expression of time since there can be a smallest expression of space. Same thing? Then again, we haven’t actually found the smallest expression of space. Every time we think we do it turns out there’s something smaller.

I’ve got your vibrating string right here.
