## Black like us.

If [this story](http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-01-diversity\_N.htm) is correct, and of the 1,790 delegates to the Republican convention only 36 are black, then the Liberal Media of the United States of Hollywood gave face-time to _44 percent_ of the black Republican delegation during Giuliani’s speech.

That is to say, in an effort to demonstrate the blinding whiteness of the Republican Party, the evil MSM (a.k.a. CNN and MSNBC) cut to the faces of _.08 percent_ of Republican delegates during the fifteen (or so) minutes Giuliani spoke.\*

I think conservatives can rest their case.
