## Black like us.

If [this story](http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-01-diversity\_N.htm) is correct, and of the 1,790 delegates to the Republican convention only 36 are black, then the Liberal Media of the United States of Hollywood gave face-time to _44 percent_ of the black Republican delegation during Giuliani’s speech.

That is to say, in an effort to demonstrate the blinding whiteness of the Republican Party, the evil MSM (a.k.a. CNN and MSNBC) cut to the faces of _.08 percent_ of Republican delegates during the fifteen (or so) minutes Giuliani spoke.\*

I think conservatives can rest their case.

I think your arithmetic is off.  You’re saying 16 people were shown.  (Is that your count?  I don’t see it in the article.)  Out of 1790, that’s 0.0089, or 0.89%!((MISSING)a bit less than 1%!)(MISSING).

But the point stands even allowing for a few decimal places of hyperbole.

Well, on second thought…it depends on what we take it to mean when the network shows a black delegate.  Is the implicit message of the shot “The GOP looks like America?”  Or, “What are these people doing here?”

“His rise is remarkable in its own right – it’s the kind of thing that could happen only in America. [laughter]”

Anyone get the joke?

I’m puzzled too.  Is it conceivable he’s saying, “Only in America could someone so plainly unworthy go so far” — assuming the audience will fill in _affirmative action_ as the reason?

I note they also found at least three asians, and a hispanic couple.

In a sea of white, they found the only shining, happy, tan faces.

I remember hearing that a similar thing happened in 2004 or 2000 or both. The unbearable whiteness of RNCing must truly be unbearable.

_The unbearable whiteness of RNCing_

That’s awesome. I’m reading the Kundera version right now.

[…] The Edge of the American West on media coverage of black delegates at the GOP convention — Your Liberal Media focused on about 16 African-American delegates during the broadcast of Giuliani’s speech. That’s 16 out of a total of 36 African-American delegates to a convention of 1,790 delegates. […]

_I’m puzzled too. Is it conceivable he’s saying, “Only in America could someone so plainly unworthy go so far” — assuming the audience will fill in affirmative action as the reason?_

I conceived the same thing, so it must be conceivable.  Yes, I think the translation is, to quote Mel Brooks, “We’d like to extend this laurel, and hardy handshake to our new . . . nigger.”

I’m not sure how coded he was being, but “Only in America” was the music playing [at the end of Obama’s acceptance speech](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/28/barack-obama-democratic-c\_n\_122224.html) (it was also used, I think someone said, at the end of one the Republican conventions). Also it goes to the flap about Michelle Obama.
