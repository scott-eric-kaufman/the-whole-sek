. . . [phlebotnum](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/the\_mirror\_of\_f.html).”

That being what Bones would’ve said had he taken a look at the “red matter” in Spock’s ship.  Which is fine because, as Russell Arben Fox [notes](http://inmedias.blogspot.com/2009/05/whats-fate-got-to-do-with-it-or-only.html), the new _Star Trek_ film manifestly _works_.  I don’t share the qualms [Timothy Burke and his commenters are expressing](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=828) over the continuity issues raised by the film, because I care more about quality than continuity.  Moreover, I think what Abrams did there was damn clever.

(_If you ain’t yet seen the film but plan to this is where you should stop reading_.)

As every critic has said, the casting was inspired.  We didn’t see [Chris Pine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1517976/) playing Shatner playing Kirk or [Zachary Quinto](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0704270/) playing Nimoy playing Spock; moreover, the ensemble cast related to each other in a manner consistent with the original.  I think this is a testament to J.J. Abrams, who has proven, again and again, to have a deft touch with ensembles: _Alias_, _Lost_, _Fringe_.  Even when the stories break down into nonsense, the interaction of his characters remain a compelling reason to keep watching.  (Or so I tell myself for sticking with _Alias_ two years longer than any sane man should.)  Why am I talking about the cast when I said I’d be talking about continuity?

Because this cast had the task of replacing icons.  There can always be another Bond or Batman.  But another Kirk or Spock?  You need to do more than cast a Spock-alike to convince an audience for whom Nimoy _is_ Spock that Quinto can fill the role.  Which isn’t to say Quinto doesn’t look like a young Leonard Nimoy at times.  Because he does.  Frighteningly so.  But looking like Nimoy isn’t the same thing as being Spock.  So what did Abrams do?

He made himself another Spock.  The Spock who witnessed a Genocide Effect and may never stare down the Genesis Device.  Who knows what the future holds for this Spock?  No one . . . all the old stories belong to the crews of different Enterprises exploring a different universe.  By introducing a new timeline, Abrams need neither bend nor buckle under the burden of history.  Fans of the original continuity keep what they have (mostly) intact, whereas _new_ fans—charmed by the _new_ cast and _new_ direction—are introduced to the franchise via a plot contrivance _that allows them to understand why all the previous series and films seem to exist in a different universe_.

By making the breaking of the continuity the central plot point of the first reboot, Abrams ensures that new fans won’t be confused when they hear, for example, that Kirk had a long and healthy relationship with his father.  This strikes me as a genius move.

You’re right that the actors didn’t slavishly imitate their predecessors, but at the same time there were moments with a couple of them–Kirk and Spock are the ones I remember–when I found myself pleasantly startled by a movement or a gesture, one that made me sit up and realize that, for example, although I’d never _thought_ about how Kirk enters a room, Chris Pine knew _exactly_ how Kirk enters a room. Those moments were a joy to watch, as were all of Leonard Nimoy’s scenes.

You say you also stuck with Alias two years longer than anyone really needed to. . .and yet you pass over the opportunity for a Rambaldi gag with the red ball, opting for (the far inferior [my opinion]) Buffy reference? Shenanigans!

Absolutely.  That last look between Kirk and Spock demonstrated that Pine and Quinto had spent a lot of time looking in the mirror and practicing how Kirk and Spock look at each other.  That said, there’s a bit of a problem with that, since that’s the sort of look old married couples give each other, and in a sense, they haven’t earned it . . . but damn, did they nail it.  

_You say you also stuck with Alias two years longer than anyone really needed to. . .and yet you pass over the opportunity for a Rambaldi gag with the red ball, opting for (the far inferior [my opinion]) Buffy reference? Shenanigans!_

The difference being, on _Alias_ they _found_ bits of Rambaldi’s Variously Wonderful Devices, whereas Whedon’s phlebotnum was an unexplained means of situational development, _i.e._ phlebtonum’s a structural device, not a narrative one.  (And, as on _Buffy_, what I liked about the “red matter” was that they didn’t even try to explain it.  Leaving the ineffable well enough alone is oftentimes the best tactic.)

The guy who played McCoy was showing that the entire film.  The voice, the small muscles around the eyes, etc.  It was clear they all did their homework.

I’m usually not a fan of time travel plots, but I thought this one worked well enough, and now they can tell new stories with characters that fans already like.  

I do not know why Scotty needed an Ewok, though.  Leave that nonsense on Tatooine.

I have to agree with you that the “alternate universe” transition to a new franchise was executed brilliantly.  Abrams’ deft handling of the Star Trek near-myth sunk in over the course of days for me, as a tinge of disappointment at the film’s apparent fast pace gave way to subsequent realizations of just how much was packed into two hours, including the aforementioned subtle nods and gestures to the original series.  It’s rare for a movie to stick with me like this, and whether a testament to the richness of the Trek universe and/or to Abrams’ genius and/or to the inspired performances of talented young actors, this iteration of Star Trek has me wishing it was a weekly series and not just a biennial motion picture offering.

Yes, yes, but the black hole juice was pulled from a [Rambaldi ball!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller\_device). That’s a meta-phlebtomulligan on its own merit.

And I meant the “inferior” dig to attach to Buffy (in comparison to Alias), and not your reference (which was absolutely valid, but not what I’d have gone with), although that may be no less offensive.

Somehow or other, I completely spaced on that.  Probably because, in the end, _Alias_ wasn’t all that memorable, which brings me to…

_And I meant the “inferior” dig to attach to Buffy (in comparison to Alias), and not your reference (which was absolutely valid, but not what I’d have gone with), although that may be no less offensive._

What!?!  Line up the best 20 episodes of each and we can totally geek out, because there’s absolutely no way _Alias_ can hold its own on artistic merits against _Buffy_.  For one, _Buffy_ only had 2 sub-par seasons out of seven, whereas _Alias_ had 2 in five.  Besides, WHAT!?!

I like the addition of _Galaxy Quest_ chompers like elements.  Things that are totally overboard, yet somehow in keeping with the original series:

The man sized big ball of “red matter,” of which Spock only needs a drop to do his assignment.  Leaving plenty left over for future plot twists.

The ridiculously convoluted water tubing system. Apparently Star Fleet ships need to waste a lot of internal space on revolving water plumbing:)

_Besides, WHAT!?!_

Because Buffy never truly caught my interest, but I’d periodically check in, and the only episodes I wholeheartedly enjoyed are a number of the Season 6/7 ones that everyone else seems to hate passionately. Which gives me two-ish seasons of Buffy that were any good compared to two AMAZING seasons of Sydney Bristow wearing wigs and kicking butt.  

(is what!)

_I’d periodically check in, and the only episodes I wholeheartedly enjoyed are a number of the Season 6/7 ones that everyone else seems to hate passionately._

That’s because the sixth and seventh seasons were, shall we say, a little more scattered narrative-wise than the first five.  Lots of individually great episodes (“Once More With Feeling,” &c.) but a weak overarching narrative.  Whereas the second and third season (easily the best, although I like the fifth a lot, with its introduction of a central character who’s been there all along but we’ve never seen before) are much more serial.  The second and third seasons are equal to the first two of _Alias_, with the exception that Whedon always knew where he was going and there was an emotional pay-off; Abrams, however, doesn’t plan ahead and needs other writers to come in and make sense of his mess (like Brian K. Vaughn on _Lost_).  Not that I fault Abrams for this; in fact, it’s actually really interesting watching the early episodes of _Lost_ again precisely because Vaughn and company are picking up on (and making sense of) little plot-points that didn’t seem important the first time through.  But the second and third seasons of _Buffy_ are masterfully structured and brilliantly executed.  I can’t recommend them highly enough.  That’s not hyperbole, just a plain statement of fact.  It’s like _The Wire_ in that respect . . . and also in the respect that I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that some people aren’t built to enjoy it.  (I don’t mean that as an insult: there’s a lot of stuff out there other people insist is beyond wonderful that, no matter how hard I try, never clicks for me like it does for them.)

Well. This type of detailed and logical argument where new facts are learned is the way to persuade me, if you want to do that. However, I remember speficially disliking seasons 2&3 of Buffy the most (I’ll have to check synopses to make sure I’m placing the events in the correct years). But I have a friend with very similar tastes who’s currently watching the entire series on borrowed DVDs for the first time, so I’ll ask her whether she thinks a dedicated rewatch is worth my time. Because I do like good TV. 

Although bringing up Lost reminds me how much I loved the first two seasons and how I now haven’t watched it in years–there certainly _is_ something about the way I’m built that loves the first two crazy years of a show J.J. provides enough to forgive him for whatever comes later. I’ve often wondered what Alias and Lost would have been like if he’d kept a hands-on role. Better? Worse? Entirely different from the start, because he would be in for the long haul? And what does this mean for the Star Trek series (something I was never even remotely a fan of until I saw this movie)?

So many important questions of geekdom.
