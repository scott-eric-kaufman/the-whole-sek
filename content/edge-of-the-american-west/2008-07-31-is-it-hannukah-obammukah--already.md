The _New York Times_ hands conservatives [a dreydl](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/us/politics/30law.html):

“Look!” [one shouts](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzdlMmYxNWYxZTc1MGMzNTFjOGFmMzcxNDFkYjc2Yzk=), “Obama’s socialism is evident in [every](http://patterico.com/2008/07/30/a-window-into-obamas-constitutional-soul-nyt-publishes-final-exams-obama-gave-to-con-law-students-at-univ-of-chicago-law-school/#comment-365388) [question](http://patterico.com/2008/07/30/a-window-into-obamas-constitutional-soul-nyt-publishes-final-exams-obama-gave-to-con-law-students-at-univ-of-chicago-law-school/#comment-365371)!”

“Actually,” [another says](http://patterico.com/2008/07/30/a-window-into-obamas-constitutional-soul-nyt-publishes-final-exams-obama-gave-to-con-law-students-at-univ-of-chicago-law-school/#comment-365387), “it seems to me that the bottom line is not the questions he asked, but how he evaluated the answers. He asks for strengths and weaknesses of different possible positions in regard to gay marriage. That’s actually (both pedagogically and philosophically) a pretty fair way of testing. It not only gets at the student’s views, but also his ability to argue the question.  But–”

“But _what_?”

“–but am I paranoid, or just appropriately suspicious, of the care he took to avoid taking positions, not publishing, questioning but not answering?”

“Exactly!” they enthuse.  “Come play now let’s begin!”

The dreydl bounces on the formica and settles into a smooth spin.

“_GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL_!” they shout.

Gimmel it is.

“_[GANTZ](http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard\_cdo/aid/597264/jewish/Gimmel.htm)_!”

[The entire pot is theirs](http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWViZGIzYjQxZWQzMjMzMWU1OGJmNjRjODczZDU2NjQ=).  They can on-the-one-hand this:

There’s little for someone hoping to exploit an image of Obama as any kind of radical academic: His responses are two-sided, finely balanced, sober. He seems the typical disinterested law prof to me, perhaps worthy of congratulations for keeping his aloofness intact, despite an incendiary subject matter.

On the same hand as this:

[C]onsulting his own answer sheet, Lecturer Obama seems a lot like Candidate Obama, saying he has no right answer and not volunteering his own opinion.

Had the dreydl not been loaded — had they spun a _[nun](http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard\_cdo/aid/597263/jewish/Nun.htm)_ — they still would’ve won the pot.  If Obama had presented himself as a “radical academic” or evidenced an itch to indoctrinate, it would’ve been proof of Secret Socialism.  [All evidence aside](http://www.apostropher.com/blog/archives/004221.html), it would’ve confirmed his status as the most liberal 
Senator
 Congressperson in the history of America.

So because Obama took his position as a teacher seriously and graded with respect to the _quality of_ instead of the _ideology behind_ an argument; because he kept his personal politics out of the classroom, as these [very same conservatives](http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/) so adamantly desire; because Obama’s behavior accorded with their ethical standards, he shouldn’t be trusted.  That there’s _no conceivable scenario in which [Travis Kavulla and his ilk](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/michelle-obamas.html) would deem Obama trustworthy_ doesn’t mean his argument is intellectually dishonest.

Wait a minute now — _it does_.  Tendentious arguments _are_ intellectually dishonest.

Whatever.

Ante up already!  Who knows?  Maybe this time they’ll spin _[shin](http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard\_cdo/aid/597267/jewish/Shin.htm)_!
