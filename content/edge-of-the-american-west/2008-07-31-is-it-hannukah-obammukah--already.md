The _New York Times_ hands conservatives [a dreydl](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/us/politics/30law.html):

“Look!” [one shouts](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzdlMmYxNWYxZTc1MGMzNTFjOGFmMzcxNDFkYjc2Yzk=), “Obama’s socialism is evident in [every](http://patterico.com/2008/07/30/a-window-into-obamas-constitutional-soul-nyt-publishes-final-exams-obama-gave-to-con-law-students-at-univ-of-chicago-law-school/#comment-365388) [question](http://patterico.com/2008/07/30/a-window-into-obamas-constitutional-soul-nyt-publishes-final-exams-obama-gave-to-con-law-students-at-univ-of-chicago-law-school/#comment-365371)!”

“Actually,” [another says](http://patterico.com/2008/07/30/a-window-into-obamas-constitutional-soul-nyt-publishes-final-exams-obama-gave-to-con-law-students-at-univ-of-chicago-law-school/#comment-365387), “it seems to me that the bottom line is not the questions he asked, but how he evaluated the answers. He asks for strengths and weaknesses of different possible positions in regard to gay marriage. That’s actually (both pedagogically and philosophically) a pretty fair way of testing. It not only gets at the student’s views, but also his ability to argue the question.  But–”

“But _what_?”

“–but am I paranoid, or just appropriately suspicious, of the care he took to avoid taking positions, not publishing, questioning but not answering?”

“Exactly!” they enthuse.  “Come play now let’s begin!”

The dreydl bounces on the formica and settles into a smooth spin.

“_GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL_!” they shout.

Gimmel it is.

“_[GANTZ](http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard\_cdo/aid/597264/jewish/Gimmel.htm)_!”

[The entire pot is theirs](http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWViZGIzYjQxZWQzMjMzMWU1OGJmNjRjODczZDU2NjQ=).  They can on-the-one-hand this:

There’s little for someone hoping to exploit an image of Obama as any kind of radical academic: His responses are two-sided, finely balanced, sober. He seems the typical disinterested law prof to me, perhaps worthy of congratulations for keeping his aloofness intact, despite an incendiary subject matter.

On the same hand as this:

[C]onsulting his own answer sheet, Lecturer Obama seems a lot like Candidate Obama, saying he has no right answer and not volunteering his own opinion.

Had the dreydl not been loaded — had they spun a _[nun](http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard\_cdo/aid/597263/jewish/Nun.htm)_ — they still would’ve won the pot.  If Obama had presented himself as a “radical academic” or evidenced an itch to indoctrinate, it would’ve been proof of Secret Socialism.  [All evidence aside](http://www.apostropher.com/blog/archives/004221.html), it would’ve confirmed his status as the most liberal 
Senator
 Congressperson in the history of America.

So because Obama took his position as a teacher seriously and graded with respect to the _quality of_ instead of the _ideology behind_ an argument; because he kept his personal politics out of the classroom, as these [very same conservatives](http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/) so adamantly desire; because Obama’s behavior accorded with their ethical standards, he shouldn’t be trusted.  That there’s _no conceivable scenario in which [Travis Kavulla and his ilk](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/michelle-obamas.html) would deem Obama trustworthy_ doesn’t mean his argument is intellectually dishonest.

Wait a minute now — _it does_.  Tendentious arguments _are_ intellectually dishonest.

Whatever.

Ante up already!  Who knows?  Maybe this time they’ll spin _[shin](http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard\_cdo/aid/597267/jewish/Shin.htm)_!

But is he made out of clay?

 Seriously, good points; utterly Morton’s fork.

Legal scholarship is an inherently far-left discipline, as these things are reckoned noawadays, because a founding principal of legal scholarship is respect for the rule of law.

The facts that legal scholarship is based on the rule of law, reason, rationality, and precedent alone is to make it “far left” to some of the purveyors in the marketplace these days; far better to simply have “faith”…

 After all, that has worked so well for the current Administration with regards to disaster prevention and relief and strategic planning for coalition warfare.

 These people make Custer look thoughtful.

Also, [WTF](http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/a\_humble\_question.php)?  It’s just as well Ambinder doesn’t permit comments.

How is “presumptuous” anything other than “uppity” got up in fancy clothing?

Ambinder didn’t include an option for “he’s a politician running for President, what do you expect?”

The poll site [does allow comments](http://answers.polldaddy.com/viewPoll.aspx?view=results&id=827426), but Ambinder doesn’t catch anywhere near the amount of shit he ought to for this.

Colbert pointed out that McCain uses “President McCain” as a chyron in his commercials.  Where’s the concern over the uppity white man?

Well . . . here. I wanna string me up some whiteys. With glandular problems. And too much agin’.

_because he kept his personal politics out of the classroom, as these very same conservatives so adamantly desire . . . he shouldn’t be trusted_

Well of course; they don’t actually believe in professionalism.  They believe in ideology.  That’s what “conservative” means these days.

On the uppityness of John McCain, you can now read [this man](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/7/31/142834/892/240/560121).  (Hint:  He drinks a whiskey drink…)

_All evidence aside, it would’ve confirmed his status as the most liberal Senator in this history of America_

Thanks for the link, but Barney Frank is objectively not a US senator. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, should definitively refute the whole “most liberal Senator” being applied to anybody but himself, right?

I took the “most liberal Senator” to be a joking reference to Obama.

I was referring to the _National Journal_.  I’ll fix it.
