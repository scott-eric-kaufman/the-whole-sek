Kind of like when the same SEK post turns up multiple times in my RSS reader.

Genius. Penguin’s design, marketing, and editorial department seem to have been in a deep and productive mind-meld for the past year or two. They’re doing great things with all aspects of their backlist lately.

Wow, that’s totally amazing.  Speaking of great book covers, wait ’til you see Kathy’s history of conspiracy theories.  It’s really nice.  And you know what press does nice covers?  North Carolina.  I don’t know who does the work for them, but it’s just great.  Not as great as this, of course, but this is spectacularly good.  And while we’re on the subject, I really don’t think that battlefield courage translates well into graphic design.  But I could be wrong.

I bet all previous cover designers for that book are kicking themselves right now.

Almost all the covers in that set are really good.

Might I vent a little about the standard translation of the work under consideration? The German title is “Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit”, which, if you retain  “work of art” and “mechanical” for “Kunstwerk” and “technisch”, would be, most straightforwardly, “the work of art in the age of its mechanical reproducibility”, which differs from the standard translation (_vide supra_) in two obvious ways: we’re talking about the reproducibility _of the artwork_, and the reproduc_ibility_ of the artwork. An age of mechanical reproduction generally could be one in which art yet gave the slip to the reproducers, and an age of mechanical reproducibility is one in which the principle of the thing matters—all _can_ succumb—even if some particular works aren’t themselves reproduced.

“…of mechanical reproduction” might be less clunky than “—of its mechanical reproducibility”, but it says something quite different. Besides, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to learn that “Reproduzierbarkeit” doesn’t strike most German speakers as the most mellifluous word choice itself; why, then, should the translation improve, especially if the clunkiness serves a useful semantic purpose?

Wouldn’t “The Work of Art in the Age of Its _Technological_ Reproducibility” be more in the spirit of the thing?  I know it’s “technical,” not “technological,” but words don’t mean what they used to anymore.  That said:

_[A]n age of mechanical reproducibility is one in which the principle of the thing matters—all can succumb—even if some particular works aren’t themselves reproduced._

I’d argue Benjamin was more interested in the principle of the matter than the particulars.

As for why the Marxist clunkiness was removed from the title, well, I’m sure there’s a story there.  I vaguely recall it having something to do with Max Brod and the Muir’s Dickensian translations of Kafka, but I can’t quite remember the details at the moment.

So it’ll be nearly $10 for a small essay?

_I’d argue Benjamin was more interested in the principle of the matter than the particulars._

…which is why “reproducibility” and not “reproduction” would be better.

_Wouldn’t “The Work of Art in the Age of Its_ Technological _Reproducibility” be more in the spirit of the thing?_ 

I explicitly stipulated that we wouldn’t bother with the translation of “technisch”, but if you want to assert that the translation’s bad in another way, then you won’t get much argument from me.

_I know it’s “technical,” not “technological,” but words don’t mean what they used to anymore._

Thanks, Ernst.

Andrew,  

You’re right that the $10 price might seem a bit high on its face, but Penguin is targeting a couple of (I think) solid markets here: people who will just be snagged by the design and will pick it up without really noting the price and people (mostly young?) who recognize Benjamin’s name but don’t have _Illuminations_ or _Reflections_; to them, this _looks_ like a small, stand-alone book, and it has an extremely intriguing title . . . and there you’ve got the makings of a sale.

Besides, paperback prices ain’t what they used to be: it’s only the rare, long-out-of-copyright-yet-still-very-salient-book-like-_Lord Jim_ that you can get for under $10 in anything but a mass-market form. Your average now-in-paperback novel of around 250 pages tends to be about $14.

I blame you for this, Levi.  Because you hand out so many free books.

_paperback prices ain’t what they used to be_

This is why I pretty much don’t buy new editions/printings of old books anymore unless there’s a discount for some reason. If I do buy new, (not counting mass market) it tends to be Oxford World’s Classics because some of their list seems to sell for lower than Penguin’s. Don’t know why that is; could just be coincidence in what I was looking for.

While I’m on the subject of publishing, what really annoys me is the persistence of the  hardcover-paperback gap. I understand this when a book might not do well enough to make it to paperback but, correct me if I’m wrong, there are other books where the gap in editions is deliberate. Sometimes when bloggers and newspapers are reviewing and promoting a new book I’ll think I want to buy it and then I look at the cost and weight of the only edition available at the time and think, no way. Then when the book has gone to paperback, I figure I’ve been without it long enough to not really care if I get it any time soon, and figure maybe if I see it used or at the library I’ll get it.

Even that traitor Clark went out of his way to praise McCain’s service while trashing it.  The fact that ari hasn’t said a single word in this thread thanking the Senator for his service to his country indicates just what sort of an Islamomexiliberafascicommunist he is!

You forgot Canadian fifth columnist, which I think I’m going to have added to my business cards if I ever make full professor.

_Sex in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction_ would be a good title for a book about the effects of porn on sex lives, but
