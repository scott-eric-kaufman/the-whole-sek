(_An 
Acephalous_ [repost](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/baseball.html) mired in optimism but apropos of nothing.  I wouldn’t normally x-post this sort of stuff, but given the [encouragement on the previous thread](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/coalitioning/), it doesn’t seem out of place here.
)

In “[On Sad and Joyful Passions of Academia](http://itself.wordpress.com/2007/09/28/on-sad-and-joyful-passions-of-academia/),” Anthony Paul Smith writes:

I get that people are unhappy with their advisors, with the lack of support from the university, and from the seeming glacial pace of publishing … But the complaints, especially from those fully funded at institutions I would imagine are very exciting, foster a different sad passion within me.  They even foster a kind of resentment that they have been given this opportunity while I have to scratch out a future … yet they seem to enjoy nothing about academic work.

The best way to talk about academic work is baseball.  This goes without saying.

I played third base and shortstop.  I played them well.  I had sure hands and quick feet.  When the ball screamed off the bat, there was no time to think.  There was only time to react.

Move the quick feet.  Catch with sure hands.  Throw the ball.

In between pitches, I would look to the man to my left to make sure we knew our assignments.  Then the ball would leave the pitcher’s hand.  Then the batter would swing.

Move the quick feet.  Catch with sure hands.  Throw the ball.

In the infield I felt like part of a team.  I could look to my left and catch the second baseman’s eye.  I could look across the diamond and catch the first baseman’s eye.  I was a player among players.  We all knew how to react and how to react together.

Then one year my coach wanted me to play center field.  Being a team player, I consented.  I’d shagged flies during practice, and was better than most at going back on a ball.  So why not?

I left the dugout and jogged past my teammates.  Then I kept jogging until my teammates looked like toy soldiers.

I stood there.  I was still playing baseball.  Only alone.  Three hundred and ninety feet from home plate.  Two hundred feet from anybody else.

Short screaming or semaphore, I couldn’t catch anyone’s attention.  I was alone.

See home plate in the shot above?  No?  Click on the picture to enlarge it.  See it now?  Focus your attention on the tiny white dot near dead center.  There’s another to its right.  Either will work.  Zoom in on them.  Those tiny dots are twice the size of a man’s head.

Now imagine something an eighth that size come shooting from the crowd.

You track the ball.  You run intuitive [quadratic models](http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:NePxgrnqxwIJ:www.gpc.edu/%!E(MISSING)mcse/CourseDocs/Math1101Projects/project2DE.doc).

You run where you think it will land.  You compensate for drag.

The wind blows it to the left.

You run intuitive quadratic models.  You compensate for drag.

Or the right.

You run intuitive quadratic models.  You compensate for drag.

Or further behind you.

You run intuitive quadratic models.  You compensate for drag.

You adjust course.  You adjust speed.  All the while you track the ball.  All the while you calculate.  The ball hangs in the air for seconds.  You spend every last one of them calculating.

This is not about reaction.

This is not about moving the quick feet.  This is not about catching with sure hands.  This is different.

And you are alone.

[![Centerfieldlone02](https://i0.wp.com/acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldlone02.jpg)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldlone02.jpg)

And everyone is watching you.

All eyes follow your eyes following the ball.  You feel them.  The weight of them.  They’re relying on you to know how wide and fast to stride.  They trust the calculations you’ve made.  They trust in the ones you will.  Sometimes that trust is well-placed.

Sometimes not.

Writing a dissertation is like playing center field:

Your eyes light on something small launched at an incredible distance.  Time slows.  You calculate where it will land.  You compensate for drag.  You track it as it flies.  While sprinting.  You adjust your course.

You are alone.  Everyone is watching you.

Fear overtakes you.  You will lose the ball in the lights.  You will lose the ball in the high glare of a slate sky.  You will trip.  You will stumble.  You will fail.

You compose yourself.  While tracking.  While sprinting.  Your chest hurts.  Your legs ache.  Then:

The satisfying recoil.

You close your glove around the ball.  You gather your wits.  You throw the ball back to the infield.

Writing a dissertation is like playing center field with one difference:

No satisfying recoil.

The fear is there.  As are the calculations.  And the gasping.  And the aching.   Sometimes you exhilarate in your own breathless grace.

Certainly.  And sometimes you admire the ball descending its clean arc.  Of course.  But:

There is no satisfying recoil.  There is no salutary smack of ball on leather.  Not yet.

You are the [outfielder problem] (http://www.mansfield.osu.edu/~dshaffer/Shaffer%!P(MISSING)ublication%!p(MISSING)df%!s(MISSING)/Publications/Uncatchable%!B(MISSING)alls%!P(MISSING)aper.pdf)(Chapman, 1968; Dienes & McLeod, 1993; McBeath, 1990; McLeod & Dienes, 1993, 1996; Montagne, Laurent, & Durey, 1998; Oudejans, Michaels, Bakker, & Davids, 1999; Todd, 1981).

You await your solution.  But:

You’re still playing baseball.  You’re still having fun.  But:

You are unsolved and you are surly.

I know I am.

Looks like that link needs some attention, maybe a little TLC.

Try it now, Nick.  

For the record, though, I won’t apologize for being overly and/or overtly and/or overly overtly earnest.  This ain’t _Unfogged_.  We’ve earned our hangdog here.

Pretty convincing, Scott: but as someone who’s played a lot of center field (but never written a dissertation), I think you gave the joy of the chase short shrift. There are almost no feelings in sports I love more than that moment when the ball leaves the bat and you know–you absolutely _know_–where it’s headed. And you pick up your feet and go. Surely in writing a dissertation there are moments, here and there, that compare?

It’s been awhile since my dissertation year, but I don’t remember any joy.  Too exhausted.  Too much anxiety.  All I remember was being glad it was done, at the end, and always.

True dat. Probably no consolation, but I’ll say it anyway (as a parallel metaphor): the psychology of writing a dissertation is like moving a mountain of manure, one shovel at a time. You know that if you can get it moved from one part of the land to another, it’ll be transformed (by shifting context) from a large pile of shit that may eventually help new things grow. And it’s good work to do. But it’s a damned big pile, and it stinks, and all you’ve got is a shovel. If you thought about how many shovels-ful you were going to have to move, you might give up and go play video-games.

But you resolve to move just _that day’s_ part of the pile, and not think too hard about the total number of days remaining. And one day you **will** look up and find the whole pile is moved. And it is remarkable how swiftly that completion will yield unforeseen positive results, for yourself and others.

Chin up!

Looking at the outfielder problem, I’d be interested in seeing an attempt to develop a robot outfielder.

I believe the surprise poetry in the phrase “Baseball Outfielders Maintain a Linear Optical Trajectory When Tracking Uncatchable Fly Balls” makes it a perfect title for a math-rock composition, or a David Foster Wallace collection.

I too have written a dissertation — and then gone on to a non-academic career.  Let me assure you that the anxiety of autonomy you describe here does not diminish with either passage.

My 4-year-old daughter is afraid of bad dreams.  I’m not sure she actually has very many, but in the morning, she’s happiest if she can report having had no dreams at all.  Last night she came to me saying she couldn’t fall asleep.  I told her that if she does have a bad dream, she can choose to escape it by waking up and then changing position before going back to sleep (not a guarantee, of course, but I elided that).  And I told her my own most recent bad dream, in which I was gripped by a horrific, unending fit of farting, so disgusting that I could only escape it by waking up, assuring myself all was physiologically normal, and rolling over.

In other words, the anxiety will continue long enough for you to start reassuring others about it.  And then it will presumably keep right on.

I don’t know anything about baseball, but I rather enjoyed writing my dissertation. My friends called me weird.

Hated every minute of bookifying it though.

The robot would have to track the ball, move to the right place, catch the ball, throw it to the right place (based on the state of the game and the capacities of teammates), and also climb fences. This seems far beyond contemporary robotics.

Thank you for helping me explain my dissertation writing to my non-academic, baseball-loving father.

You’ve succeeded in both dredging up memories of the anxiety I wallowed in while writing my own dissertation and starting a continuos loop playing in my head of that John Fogarty song, “Centerfield.”

I just successfully watched a baseball game in the company of a HS baseball coach and a baseball-card collector. I said interesting things at the right time. The coach had coached one of the guys we saw on TV (the warmup catcher — not a roster player). He recommended a book to me about Minnesota Town baseball. Fun was had by all. Minnesota took the Yankee 2 games to 1. I still don’t accept either baseball or football as a metaphor for life, though SEK is a good person otherwise.
