## Panel Reminder: Public Spheres, Blogospheres*

Here’s [the who and the where and the when](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/conference-anno.html).  A wonderful time will be had by all.  As Ari will tell you, my slagging of Jonah Goldberg is unparalleled.  It isn’t like a [Sadly, No!](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/8193.html) slagging.   It is a very serious, thoughtful slagging that has never been made in such detail or with such care.   (Largely because I quote him at length, but still.)

\*Title edited because I can’t read posters.

_(Largely because I quote him at length, but still.)_

I would definitely go out of my way to hear someone quote Goldberg at length. Especially if it involved going to Irvine.

Anyway, I sincerely doubt that your critique was made with more care than [this masterpiece for the ages](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2007\_12\_16.html#007956).

You’re still bitter that I quoted Flippanter over you, are you?  Well then, um, deal.  (But seriously, folks, don’t come for me or Goldberg’s unintentional hilarity—come for the other people!)

I believe I had forgotten about that, and indeed barely now, reminded, remember that something like that took place.

But yes, very bitter.

By the way, I am going to have PK in hand the entire day.  Anyone who wants to provide entertainment for an 8-year old boy at any point will earn my gratitude, and his.  (He’s bringing a book and can play with my iphone, but that’s a hell of a long day for a kid to basically self-entertain.)

_I would definitely go out of my way to hear someone quote Goldberg at length. Especially if it involved going to Irvine._

And yet, I doubt we will see you there.  Alas.

If he’d rather self-entertain with a Wii and a couple of cats, I do have an apartment conveniently located on campus. 

(I should send this in an email, shouldn’t I?)

Vance, I blame Ezra.  [He](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better\_Than\_Ezra) ain’t better than nobody.

Oh, never mind!  My stupid car broke on the way down!  So I’m cancelling at the last possible minute because I am the flakiest flake in the entire goddamn cereal box.

Of course this \*would\* happen after I’d basically abandoned real anonymity, just for maximum mortification.  I hate myself.

That sucks, B.  I’ll pass it along to the conference folks.
