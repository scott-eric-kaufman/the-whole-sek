Here’s [the who and the where and the when](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/conference-anno.html).  A wonderful time will be had by all.  As Ari will tell you, my slagging of Jonah Goldberg is unparalleled.  It isn’t like a [Sadly, No!](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/8193.html) slagging.   It is a very serious, thoughtful slagging that has never been made in such detail or with such care.   (Largely because I quote him at length, but still.)

\*Title edited because I can’t read posters.
