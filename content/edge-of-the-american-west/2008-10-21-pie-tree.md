## Pie tree?

McCain’s new talking point confuses me:

Senator Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of the pie than he is in growing the pie.

How do you grow a pie?  It’s not by spreading the wealth around, that’s for sure, because spreading the wealth around is spreading the wealth around, my friends.  Raising taxes won’t grow a pie.  Victory in Iraq depends on not spreading the wealth around, because spreading the wealth around is unconditionally spreading the wealth around with unrepentant—wait, that was last week—with spreading the wealth around.  My friends, spreading the wealth around isn’t a new direction, and we have to fight for it and I have a hatchet and the scars to prove it.  We will stop overhead projectors and pork.  Obama can’t grow pies!  But he can and will be spreading the wealth around and you will know their names.  No more pork!  Grow pies!

McCain people, call me—I can keep this up forever.
