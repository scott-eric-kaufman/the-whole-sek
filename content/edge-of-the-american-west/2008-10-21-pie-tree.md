## Pie tree?

McCain’s new talking point confuses me:

Senator Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of the pie than he is in growing the pie.

How do you grow a pie?  It’s not by spreading the wealth around, that’s for sure, because spreading the wealth around is spreading the wealth around, my friends.  Raising taxes won’t grow a pie.  Victory in Iraq depends on not spreading the wealth around, because spreading the wealth around is unconditionally spreading the wealth around with unrepentant—wait, that was last week—with spreading the wealth around.  My friends, spreading the wealth around isn’t a new direction, and we have to fight for it and I have a hatchet and the scars to prove it.  We will stop overhead projectors and pork.  Obama can’t grow pies!  But he can and will be spreading the wealth around and you will know their names.  No more pork!  Grow pies!

McCain people, call me—I can keep this up forever.

As hard as this might be for Arthur Laffer and Jude Wanniski to accept, one **can** grow the pie by raising taxes, just as long as those tax revenues are then spent on things like inventing the internet (DARPA), rural electrification, bridges, transit — that is, on infrastructure and on Federal support for research.

What we have seen clearly demonstrated in the years since Reagan is that supply-side economics and lowering taxes on the wealthiest simply insures that they get most of the pie.

This is just another example of McCain’s elitist political shorthand getting in the way of connecting with regular people. Though it’s a legitimate theoretical concept, he says it in a way that is not accessible to voters who aren’t familiar with political theory. 

I’m not saying McCain is an elitist, or that I agree with the “growing the pie” philosophy, but I am saying this is part of the reason why McCain didn’t win any of the debates and has performed poorly in the polls.

As Joel indicates, it’s not hard to guess what theory McCain is adumbrating: lower taxes → enterprise → rising tide → floating boats. The only difficulty is in taking it seriously.

I’m not entirely sure a pie can float, so I’m not sure where McCaine’s going with this thought.

Who wants to grow a pie, anyways?  Are there people out there for whom an ordinary-sized apple pie is simply not enough, and who must stuff extra apples into it?  Really, what the people who say this mean is that there should be more pies.

And the whole concept of “your piece of the pie” is troublesome too.  When the pie is baked, do you have a piece of it all marked out? No, of course not.  It’s fair to divide the pie into equal pieces, one for each person.  But then you’re “interested in controlling who gets [pieces] of the pie”.  Huh.

As I pointed out to my students last month, the pie diagram, as seen in intro econ classes for the past 40+(?) years, is a cold war era framing.  The teacher shows two pies, a distinctly communist pie with equal pieces and a much larger capitalist pie with unequal pieces, and asks which is better.  That’s a false dichotomy, as the range of pies we are considering are more closer in size and still unequal (but some not as grotesquely as others) in portion.

In other words, like most economists, I’m voting for the candidate who hangs out with economists who have real training in the issues of this century, not the candidate who takes advice from a guy who took a managerial economics course once, 30 years ago.

I would, however, vote for an overstuffed apple pie.

you’re just trying to lure fafnir over here, right?

i mean, fafblog is the world’s only and original center for pie-blogging.

(though weebl and bob made an important contribution to the genre).

_McCain people, call me—I can keep this up forever._

What, pray tell, are you expecting them to say, offer or threaten? And what would you respond that they might consider positive or helpful?

What if the pie is a pork pie?  Do we still want to grow it, Senator Doughboy?

When John McCain was a POW, he did not have any “pies.”  He went five and a half years without pie.  He’d really like a slice, but has way too much honor to ask.  Besides, Obama’s pie-sharing will contribute to the obesity epidemic.

How many men ever went to a bake sale and would let one man slice off of the pie what’s intended for 9/10th of the people to eat?

If anyone mentions “[Cherry Pie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdDxz2bkfhE),” you know they’re guilty of making sexist comments about Sarah Pielin. Er. Palin.

Has anyone actually asked McCain where the money in his paycheck for being a Senator comes from?

It’s from guys like Joe the Plumber who pay their taxes. How is that not redistribution of wealth?
