(_By [request](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/dr-seuss-on-the-state-of-the-blogosphere.html), the parody of [this beloved book](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/dreeves/Fox-In-Socks.txt) that originally appeared in [the historical novel thread](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/historical-novels-underrated-or-no-are-only-ever-incidentally-historical/#comment-52554)_.)

What do I know about tweeting bloggers? Well . . .


When tweeting bloggers fight,  

it’s called a tweeting  

blogger battle.

And when they battle ’bout the future,  

it’s a tweeting blogger  

augur battle.

And when tweeting bloggers battle  

over augurs in a muddle,  

they call it a muddled  

tweeting blogger  

augur battle.

AND . . .

When bloggers battle bloggers  

in a muddled augur battle,  

and the tweeting blogger battle  

is about Barack Obama,  

they call this a  

muddled tweeting  

blogger augur  

battle ’bout  

Barack Obama.

AND . . .

When bloggers fight these battles  

over augurs ’bout Obama,  

and Obama’s being born  

in a Kenya or Jakarta,  

they call THIS a  

muddled tweeting  

birther blogger  

augur battle  

’bout Obama.

AND . . .

When Barack is being born  

in a Kenya or Jakarta,  

and the birther bloggers blog  

about Obama Mama augurs,  

and the dentist lawyer lady  

tells the muddled crying man,  

’bout the huddled battle tweeters  

massed along the Rio Grande . . .

_Stop it!  Stop it!  

Shut your trap, sir!  

I can’t listen to this crap, sir!_
 __ 

_FOX in News, our game is done, sir.  

It has been no fucking fun, sir._

is this a good place to note that researchers have discovered conan doyle’s giant rat of sumatra?

[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/09/07/giant.rat.papua/index.html](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/09/07/giant.rat.papua/index.html)

I do not like FOX in the news,  

I do not like the news they choose.  

I do not like them in a blog,  

I do not like their mental fog.  

I will not watch them on TV  

I will not let them tweet at me.  

I will not let them in my house,  

I would not feed them to a mouse,  

I follow not their muddled train,  

The problem is, I have a brain.  

I do not like them, SEK,  

But you, I would read any day.
