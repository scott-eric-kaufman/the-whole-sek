## Gays are like ninjas that way.

[Beyerstein](http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise\_/2009/05/thune-no-gay-justice-.html) and [Benen](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009\_05/018065.php) rightly point out that Jeff Session’s [magnanimous decision](http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/sessions-would-consider-gay-nominee-2009-05-06.html) not to automatically disqualify a gay nominee is an intellectually dishonest ruse designed to preserve the intellectual dishonesty of his fellow Republicans.  “We could imagine seating a gay judge, but their position on gay issues would align them with the far left and we think a moderate justice would better serve the needs of the American people.”  Not that they’d ever say that—but of course they would.  I yield the floor to the [gentlemen](chambliss.senate.gov/) from Georgia: “It’s something I’d have to think through with respect to whatever issues might be forthcoming that the court may have to consider.”  More interesting than the predictable hypocrisy of bigots are the reponses from Session’s compatriots:

“It’s not been part of the calculus for me,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I have never, frankly, thought about that situation,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the GOP standard-bearer in the 2008 presidential election.

“I’ve never thought about it,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.).

Why did it never cross their minds that a gay person might aspire to a position on the highest court of the land?  Most would say it has something to do with them being incapable of sympathizing with a good chunk of their constituency.  They wouldn’t be wrong.  But I like to think this befuddlement a sign that the rainbow cloaks and resplendent daggers of the great homosexual conspiracy learned how to hide in plain sight.  Instead of months of comminuted innuendo that amount to the fear that someone might someday marry his dog, conservatives will stroll blithely down the corridors of power completely unaware that a certain piece of legislation might be good for the gays _until it’s too late to do anything about it._

_Why did it never cross their minds that a gay person might aspire to a position on the highest court of the land?_ 

That particular thought has never crossed my mind, either.

Seriously?  I suppose maybe I know too many gay people who clerked for lesser courts but dream big dreams.

My comment directed to Ben.  Not SEK, who is clearly down with the gay gente.

You’d be surprised how little time I spend thinking about who, aside from me, might want to serve on the supreme court.

that is a pretty uncharitable interpretation of murkowski, mccain and corker said.  

this is so especially as regards murkowski and corker (omitted from corker’s comment “But I don’t look at things through that lens in regards to the type of position we’re talking about.”)  a more charitable interpretation that it has never crossed their minds whether or not they would vote to confirm a gay judge because that it is not a relevant consideration.  the answers are a partial dodge, so they can’t be quoted as saying “of course i’d vote to confirm a gay judge” with any caveat omitted.  

most of the republicans quoted in the article basically said what i think is the right answer, that sexual orientation should be irrelevant to a nominees confirmation to the court.  in reality, republicans may have trouble voting to confirm a gay nominee because, as you note, gay marriage is a hot button issue for their base and a gay supreme court justice would be likely to advance marriage equality for gays.

“comminuted”?

like, pulverized, ground to dust? 

why?

“comminuted innuendo that amount to the fear that someone might someday marry his dog”

That’s nothing.  One of my senators spreads more than innuendo about folks marrying reptiles:

I assume, once gay republican congress critters accidentally out themselves, that all their past votes are automatically switched because of course they voted the wrong way secretly to promote the homosexual agenda.

This gives a whole new dimension to the old ‘pirates vs. ninjas’ feud.

Inevitably, after anti-gay prejudice has become something that not even Republicans can acknowledge in polite company anymore, and the GOP transitions to pretending that they, not the Democrats, were for gay rights all along (“It was Bill Clinton who signed DOMA and DADT,” we’ll hear), some future Republican president is going to nominate a gay Clarence Thomas to the SCOTUS.  Fortunately, the venerable octagenarian Senator Barney Frank will be around to eviscerate him in the confirmation hearings.

\*but their position on gay issues would align them with the far left…\*

May I say a couple of words to Sen. Sessions? “Log Cabin”?  ^..^

Well, a lot of rumors have always surrounded Justice Souter . . .

I’m given to understand that even Clarence Thomas embraces tolerance of homosexual conduct within certain limited boundaries (specifically, that it be of the female-on-female variety, and that it be videographically recorded for the purpose of enhancing the heterosexual male masturbation experience).

I love [this exchange with Scalia](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=503540):

An audience member later rose to ask Scalia “whether you have any gay friends, and–if not–whether you’d like to be my friend.”
“I probably do have some gay friends,” Scalia said. “I’ve never pressed the point.”

And if it wasn’t under oath, it would be inadmissable anyway, right?

If you never press the point, is that like not inhaling?

Never crossed their minds? Is [Jim Hormel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James\_Hormel#Ambassadorship) ancient history? How about [Janet Neff](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/2007/05/the\_neverending.html)?
