## Gays are like ninjas that way.

[Beyerstein](http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise\_/2009/05/thune-no-gay-justice-.html) and [Benen](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009\_05/018065.php) rightly point out that Jeff Session’s [magnanimous decision](http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/sessions-would-consider-gay-nominee-2009-05-06.html) not to automatically disqualify a gay nominee is an intellectually dishonest ruse designed to preserve the intellectual dishonesty of his fellow Republicans.  “We could imagine seating a gay judge, but their position on gay issues would align them with the far left and we think a moderate justice would better serve the needs of the American people.”  Not that they’d ever say that—but of course they would.  I yield the floor to the [gentlemen](chambliss.senate.gov/) from Georgia: “It’s something I’d have to think through with respect to whatever issues might be forthcoming that the court may have to consider.”  More interesting than the predictable hypocrisy of bigots are the reponses from Session’s compatriots:

“It’s not been part of the calculus for me,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I have never, frankly, thought about that situation,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the GOP standard-bearer in the 2008 presidential election.

“I’ve never thought about it,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.).

Why did it never cross their minds that a gay person might aspire to a position on the highest court of the land?  Most would say it has something to do with them being incapable of sympathizing with a good chunk of their constituency.  They wouldn’t be wrong.  But I like to think this befuddlement a sign that the rainbow cloaks and resplendent daggers of the great homosexual conspiracy learned how to hide in plain sight.  Instead of months of comminuted innuendo that amount to the fear that someone might someday marry his dog, conservatives will stroll blithely down the corridors of power completely unaware that a certain piece of legislation might be good for the gays _until it’s too late to do anything about it._
