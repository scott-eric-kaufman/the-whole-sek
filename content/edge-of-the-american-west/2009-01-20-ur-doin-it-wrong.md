Next time you invite [John Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman\_music#Original\_recording\_information) to score an inauguration, make sure he gets it right.  If I may offer a suggestion:

There should be a version with outgoing music for Cheney.

I was looking for a version of “The Imperial March” to overlay the Cheney, but couldn’t find one that I could plug into my movie making software easily.  (By which I mean, “in under two minutes.”)

Can anyone point me to a transcript of the inaugural poem that preserves the linebreaks?

Every time I saw Cheney I made a Vader wisecrack, until even my wife was tired of it. When BHO shook the Sith lord’s hand after the Oath, I said, “Thank you Lord Vader.”

I’ll be glad to put all this behind me.

I actually really like the Simple Gifts. I know it was cheesy and basically just an arrangement of the Copland, but I thought it was both nice and appropriate.

I might be wrong, but I’m interpreting SEK as making a joke here–not a musical criticism. Someone please slap me if I’m wrong.

For the record, this music made me cry. That it was played by a  Jewish violinist, an Asian cellist, a black clarinetist, and a Hispanic pianist just made it more cool.

_basically just an arrangement of the Copland_

I think the Copland is basically just an arrangement of “Simple Gifts”.

1. I liked the joke, and i laughed when I heard it. Superman is awesome.

2. Fair enough Eric, but John Williams seems to be using a number of the same gestures/moments as Copland. Also, the instrumentation, especially featuring cello and clarinet, is very reminiscent of the Copland.

An addendum to the previous remark: I just listened to it again, and it kind of sucks. Superman would have been much better, though really they should have gotten a good/famous american composer.

Ninjaphilosopher is right, I think: this wasn’t Williams coincidentally deciding that “Simple Gifts” is the Quintessential American Melody, but Williams deciding to arrange a riff on Copland’s Quintessential American Symphony for that meticulously multiethnic quartet. There wasn’t an original thought anywhere in the piece, in conception or execution. 

Now if he’d reconceived it as a Jazz piece, ala Gershwin…. I might have forgiven it. As it was, it reminded me of the old Doonesbury riffs on Carter’s “Secretary of Symbolism.”

I have to agree with those critical of Williams. I love his music, but he seems to be having some issues with originality lately; the main theme from Harry Potter happens to be pretty much ripped, note for note, from Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake. 

Beyond that, I imagine Williams might have been thinking that the occasion called for something recognizable to the emotional string chords of most Americans, and for that, it was a really good choice. But wasn’t this a great chance to write something new that would uniquely conjure up images of this specific moment from now on? It deserves its own masterpiece.

**[Robert Zimmerman](http://reharmonized.an-earful.com)**

					

		

They’re not really arrangements–the word doesn’t do justice to either composer. Copland used “Simple Gifts” as the basis for theme and variations in Appalachian Spring. Williams was obviously evoking Copland, but other than using the same theme it was a pastiche of Copland’s musical language in general and Appalachian Spring in particular. That’s Williams’ gift. I thought it was beautifully done.

Yes, not only beautiful, but traditional and innovative, accessable to all, and so in all those ways very appropriate.  I liked the way it mirrored Obama’s long-standing invocations of the founders, Lincoln, etc.

Well, gosh, I guess I should have reloaded the page, because a bunch of stuff went up while I was typing. I’m not convinced that an short outdoor performance in the middle of winter from an acoustic chamber group playing for hundreds of thousands was a setting for a masterpiece. He had to do something that felt American and that would sound well in that setting.

Anyway, if the organizers had wanted an original masterpiece they wouldn’t (or shouldn’t) have hired Williams, they would (or should) have hired George Crumb or John Adams or John Zorn or some other high-concept composer. Williams did what he always does.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the announcer credited everyone involved with that performance except for Copland.  No matter what you think of the arrangement, that just stinks.

I’m dubious as to whether or not John Williams has ever had an original musical idea. Don’t get me wrong, I think his movie music is fun and dramatic, but original? I don’t think so. A better idea would have been to pare down the original chamber version of the theme and variations, and not have Williams in the picture at all.

Right, the question of whether any actual music was harmed in the making of that inauguration is tangential to the post. And everyone’s a critic even though you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make her drink. You can dance about architecture till you’re blue in the face, but I say _the time has come to set aside childish things._

It’s still not an “arrangement.”

I’ve been making Cheney-Vader jokes (_“He’s more machine now than man, twisted and evil.”_) for so many years that I’m actually a little sad that I won’t have much opportunity for them anymore.

Not that sad, mind you.  Just a smidge.

Um, it took me right back to primary school. Terrible singing ‘Dance, then, wherever you may be; I am the Lord of the Dance, said he… la la la la (as everyone but the teacher forgets the rest of the chorus)’ + really bad dancing. And that just ain’t right at a presidential inauguration.

Okay, guys–Williams is a gifted arranger, a facile if not terribly original composer, who cobs from Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, most of the Romantics and anyone else whose work suits his job in hand.  And “Simple Gifts” may be over-familiar.  But what did you expect? First-rate perfoermers can make a silk purse of almost any piece of music and Williams’s pastiche was far from a sow’s ear.

Well, maybe it would have been nice to hear “So Long, Saddle Pals” playing over Bush and Darth Strangelove as they faded from view.  Almost as nice as the sounds of police sirens racing after Cheney, stopping him before he flees to Argentina.

i am completely ignorant about music and tone deaf to boot, and when the “classical music” began yesterday i groaned and settled back to endure it till it was over.

to my surprise, i enjoyed it quite a bit!

Given Aretha Franklin’s and Elizabeth Alexander’s performances, criticizing the instrumental quartet seems misplaced. I’d be happy listening to that foursome playing almost anything.

I saw a post elsewhere that part of the reason for selecting a Copland-inspired (influenced? derived?) piece was that Copland was denied the opportunity to perform at one of DDE’s inagural because of his PAF, or something akin to it…

So why not play some Copland? 

Contra Robert Zimmerman (!), I think John Adams would have been quite capable of a direct and entertaining address to a wide audience — take _Short Ride in a Fast Machine_. But his métier is the orchestra, and as Ralph suggests, the charisma of the individual players was obviously an important part of the effect aimed at here.

[PAF](http://www.all-acronyms.com/PAF)???

Copland’s great, I love his stuff, entirely appropriate (they used “Fanfare for the Common Man” as the herald music for Carter’s entrance). But it would have been more appropriate to admit up front that it was a Copland schtick, rather than calling it a John Williams piece. I was so surprised, frankly, that I was entirely distracted from the quality of the playing (also, the sound balance was off, I think: the clarinet was inaudible in the later sections, though the guy was clearly playing for all he was worth). It’s too bad, because (as Ralph suggests) Perlman could play Oscar Meyer Weiner jingles and it would be worth listening to.

_as entertainment for the great unwashed, it worked._

If you liked Williams’ piece, you should try the original “Appalachian Spring.” It’s better.

Vance is right, but his point isn’t really contra mine–I didn’t say anything about what John Adams couldn’t do. I just picked a few well-known composers who could have been counted on to project their own original musical personality. Adams would have been a great choice.

I heartily second the recommendation to give Appalachian Spring a listen. It’s a fabulous piece of music. But for that occasion I vastly prefer Williams’ pastiche to the idea of an excerpted and arranged version of the Copland. That would have been heartbreaking. The balance issues Ahistoricality points out are one of the reasons that raw Copland or some other more original/ambitious piece wouldn’t have been the right thing.
