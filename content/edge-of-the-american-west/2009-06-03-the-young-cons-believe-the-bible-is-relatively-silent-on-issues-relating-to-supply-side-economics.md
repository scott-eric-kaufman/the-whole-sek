Laughing at the “Young Con Anthem” because neither “Serious C” nor “Stiltz” have skillz is all well and good, but there’s more to their awfulness than the sort of schadenfreude you get watching the first two weeks of _American Idol_.  For the uninitiated:


This breed of rap is all about establishing and maintaining identity, which you do by asserting your authenticity and questioning that of other rappers—either by attacking it whole cloth (coastal feuds) or its legitimacy (street credibility).  The Young Cons talk up their own game like some white Wu-Tang.  Ideally, these assertions of identity should be such that when they “[manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDBJXZjmLro).”  (Let that play while you work and your dull life will turn into a [Jim Jarmusch film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=resUyjKmOj0).)  What makes the Young Cons so tellingly awful is that they sat down to forge a statement of identity, _produced something entirely incoherent_, then looked upon their words and declared themselves ready for battle.  Their awkward juxtapositions and clumsier delivery foreground conservative schizophrenia:

Bail out a business, but can’t protect an infant.

My conservative view is, drill baby drill,  

You can say you hate me, but I’m praying for you still.

The Bible says, we’re a people under God,  

AIG was hooked up by Chris Dodd.  

A classy gift ain’t an Ipod.

Then there’s the lyric people have held up to the most mockery:

Three things taught me conservative love:  

Jesus, Ronald Reagan, plus _Atlas Shrugged_.  

Saving our nation from inflation devastation,  

On my hands and my knees praying for salvation.

They’re not talking about coalitional politics here—the necessity of compromising with constiuency X despite their outlandish positions on Y in order to [get disappointed by someone new](http://www.cafepress.com/edgeofthewest.278096071)—they’re claiming _as their authentic identity_ the ideological incoherence of political coalitions.  They haven’t put the cart before the horse so much as glued the horse to its side and demanded it be pulled down the mountain; then later, as they sift through the gore and gristle that had been their horse and cart, they turn to us and say, “We meant to do that.”

One last thing: is Scott Johnson “[almost certain that this is the first time the word ‘inherently’ has made its appearance in hip-hop](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/05/023678.php)” because he can’t understand a word black people say or because he’s never even tried to?

The title comes from their [home page](http://theyoungcons.com/).  Also, if this video mysteriously vanishes into the same hole that every version of Amy Ray’s cover of “Romeo and Juliet” did, I’m throwing in the towel.

I thought it was “Stiltz” because he was tall…. (yes, I watched it. Once you’ve been to a few folk club open mike nights, your tolerance for “earnest but crappy” goes up a fair bit. [_Thanks for catching that. I’m not sure whether to blame my tired mind or failing eyesight for that one. — SEK_]

I would have been a bit more impressed, I think, if they’d subverted the medium a bit more: not only shooting in a classroom, but actually moving conservatively, instead of awkwardly. There’s nothing that says you can’t rap while you stand at a podium, is there?

The fact that Reagan lies safely in the past surely makes it easier to idealize him.

And surely, SEK, it would be malicious not to credit Johnson with the encyclopedic knowledge of hip-hop he implies. You deconstructionists, always reading in bad faith.

I remember in the late ’80s there was a track getting radio airplay of Ronald Regan rapping. All I remember was that there was a lot of record scratching and clips of him saying “Well…” and “Nancy!” in a loop. I’d love to dig that up.

Too much Twain, it seems: “We could do a prodigious trade [in portrait-painting] with the women if we could foreground the things they like, but they don’t give a damn for artillery” (_The American Claimant_ 153).

But that’s just me being silly, because [I do it all the time](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%!A(MISSING)http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)acephalous.typepad.com%!F(MISSING)+foreground&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a).

There are earlier examples of the [podium rapping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDiUnSXUqZ0).

“Serious C”  has a little bit of flow.  Too bad he can’t rhyme.

Also, shouldn’t these guys be able to afford better lighting?  This is like the cable access of conservative rap.

_It plods, it plods!_

That’s how I finally figured out it couldn’t be a joke — it’s genuinely, boy-scoutishly _dutiful_.  I’m still slightly incredulous, though I’m sure you could find even neo-Nazi hip-hop offered in dead earnest if you looked hard enough.  (With better production values, too?  How not!  They have their proud traditions to uphold!  Paging Leni (“Seriusch R”) Riefenstahl.)

As to Powerline’s gibe that this was probably the first time “inherently” appeared in hip-hopｌｙりｃｓ, well, [15 seconds of searching lays waste to that theory, which I found implausible on the face of it.](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%!A(MISSING)www.ohhla.com+inherently&aq=f&oq=&aqi=)

Those guys are cute, but I wouldn’t want any of my sisters to marry one of ’em.  (My married sisters are all hitched to Reagan Republicans, who at least make some kind of half-sense, half the time.)

I actually possess–in a far corner of one of my closets–the 45 of Ronald Reagan rapping.  I can’t recall the song’s name, but it was by the Pee Bee Squad.  My favorite line was, a la Musique, Reagan saying, “push, push, in the George Bush.”

Blame my lack of familiarity with the genre, especially the visual aspects. No surprise that a neophyte’s idea of subversion has already been done to death. 

Still, if you’re going to use a classroom as a rap venue, they should _use_ it. Or perhaps I’m applying Chekhov’s gun to the wrong genre again.

Of course it’s not the first time “inherently” appears in hip hop.  And of course, “inherently” doesn’t appear very often in any contemporary lyrics at all (total Google time has now increased to 30 seconds).  The again, having one lonely thought, not confirming its relevance or accuracy, and refusing to ask any meaningful follow-ups keeps George Will in the national spotlight.  Maybe we should understand adherence to that form as a kind of professional ambition.

_And of course, “inherently” doesn’t appear very often in any contemporary lyrics at all_

No, but here’s where Powerline flashed it’s cluelessness: sure, hip-hop lyrics use words like muthahfuckah somewhat more than, say, your average Christian radio station, but anyone with even a casual acquaintance with the form knows that it sports a higher vocabulary of _other_ low-frequency words as well.

And isn’t that what conservatives really hate about libruls, too?  That we say “fuck” a lot, but also “trope”?

Powerline got no dope trope, but they got enough rope . . . .
