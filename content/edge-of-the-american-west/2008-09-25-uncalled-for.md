I would appreciate it if everyone would hate on:

1.  [Mr. Bady](http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/) for sharing [this](http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2008/09/manuel-mets-sus.html).
2.  Mr. Manuel and Mr. McCain for making it possible.

Since there’s hate to share, some should be extended to Tatsuya Ishida for this:

That’s totally awesome.

Why am I getting a late start this morning?  Because of my deep concern for this nation’s financial crisis.  In fact, I think I’m just going to cancel all my classes and keep PK home from school until it’s all been resolved.

Following my forward-thinking Mets, my dissertation is on hold until the financial crisis has been solved and the world is rid of war, poverty, and prejudice.

Hey, my Bears have suspended their run for the Super Bowl title for a very long time!  How patriotic is that? :)

Out of patriotism, I had suspended my usual daily program of self-loathing in deference to the very serious crisis that besets our national economy. Now, however, SEK has forced me to get back to it. Gosh, I hate myself.

I think I might suspend grading until my own financial house is back in order. Though getting fired might make that more difficult: anyone want to bail me out?

I wish I had thought of this first re: White Sox/Twins.  ‘Cause that’s very funny.

Glad you like it, Rich. Sinfest is one of the most professional webcomics and yet one of the ones least likely to be syndicated (at least eleven rejections thus far).

As long as we’re whining about baseball, I hadn’t realized [until today](http://pedantspot.blogspot.com/2008/09/word-of-day-is-timeous.html) that the Yankees were even worse than they look once you look at their Pythagorean Expectations.
