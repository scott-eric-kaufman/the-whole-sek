(_[An unrelated link](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/because-ive-bec.html) for those who’d prefer to laugh **at** rather than **with** me._)

What’s wrong 1) with the modern conservative movement and 2) pandering to it?  [This](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/29/palin-for-america-a-true-conservative/#comment-427346):

I told my wife this morning we can now go vote on November 4th. McCain is not as stupid as we right-wingers thought he was.

Ain’t it sweet of him to enfranchise his wife?  Now she can join the 909 (of 7,500) citizens of Wasilla who elected Sarah Palin mayor and the 114,697 (of 683,478) citizens of Alaska who elected her governor.\*  I know I’m being unfair.  This in no way reflects on Palin, who is [her own woman](http://www.palinforgovernor.com/), who possesses [strong feminist credentials](http://www.palinforgovernor.com/), and who would [never let any man speak for her](http://www.palinforgovernor.com/).

* * *

\*Ignore as irrelevant the fact that the equivalent of the _entire state of Alaska_ (655,923) voted Obama into the Senate.  Because no matter what, come what may, roam if you want to (only don’t), the important thing to remember is Obama lacks executive experience ([whatever that is](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian\_wings/2008/08/more-on-executi.html)).

I’m distressed that you’d read fourteen whole comments into a Malkin thread.  I hope this means you’ve finished and defended your dissertation, gotten drunk a half dozen times, checked the air in your tires, cleaned the lint trap in your drier, etc., etc.

Nope.  Turned in my last chapter, am polishing my introduction, and am tired unto inarticulateness.  But angry!  I had a whole post about tokenism I deleted because I’m not that intemperate, damn it, I just am.  (And inarticulate.)

My goodness, those comments are horrid. Where are the liberal trolls! I can’t find a single moderate liberal-liberal blog that is not infested with conservative trolls. You definitely picked the most unintentionally ironic of the bunch. Ugh…I was just telling my wife how nice it would be to actually have a president I voted for in power (Only been eligible to vote in ’00 and ’04…). If McCain manages to win beyond all reason, I’m not quite sure how I’ll react. It’s so hard being optimistic as it is, being an endemically cynical member of gen-Y, I don’t know when I’d recover.

If you’re ever tempted to read Malkin, let alone her comments, you should turn off the computer and immediately call a shrink.

_Where are the liberal trolls!_

Malkin’s site used to limit commenters to people who’d registered, and registration was only open for brief periods, unannounced in advance, so generally available only to her faithful. (I’m not making this, up, I swear: I couldn’t if I tried!) Moreover, she’s consistently maintained the right to remove any “hostile” or “abusive” commenters, by which she means anyone to the left of, as the saying goes, Atilla the Hun. 

There are liberal trolls (or at least Trotskyite ones) with the intestinal fortitude to go into that pit, but the gates are barred.

I laughed at you.  You’re the only person I know who could write that about that.  And I don’t even know you.

Oh, yeah, and Malkin — what’s up with that?

Wow. I had a pretty serious case of trichotillomania about twelve years ago. I remember sitting against the wall in my philosophy of religion class and denuding the right side of my chin. My stylish goatee didn’t look all that great before that episode, but this did not help.

More to the point of your post, though, here’s another champion comment from the Malkin thread:

“great looking AND hunts? whats not to love??”

I don’t know . . . the soullessness, maybe?

Hey, guy. Nice of you to look up the population of Alaska and assume they are all legal registered voters.  Anyone under 18 must have missed a golden opportunity in your book.

You have your head up your behind, man.  Leave the politics for people who at least can recognize that not all of the population can legally vote at least.
