But you can call me Scott. You may remember me from my star turns as “[electrician](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442262/)” in _[Brick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/)_ (2005) or “[electrician: Los Angeles](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442262/)” in [_The Kid Stays in the Picture_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303353/) (2003), but that’s not the _real_ me.   _[This](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html)_ is the real me.   (But _[this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html)_ will be my legacy.)   I know what you’re thinking.   Why would Ari and Eric invite a guy who studies literature to join them on the edge of the American West?

I don’t know either.

I don’t “do” history.   I’m an historicist.   Understanding the difference between the two would require I provide you a detailed account of why the items on [this list](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/today\_seems\_to\_.html) are on it, but such an account would desecrate the very thing it describes.   (Sins of non-omission make the [Baby Greenblatt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen\_Greenblatt) cry.)   This is because historicism is less about evidence and attentiveness and archives and more about Hayden White and Michel Foucault giving me permission to [make shit up](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/dissertation\_ar.html).\*

I want to thank Ari and Eric for giving me the opportunity to play truant at [two group blogs](http://thevalve.org/) until I finish my dissertation. I’m truly honored they esteem my drivel enough to let it sully their good names, and will do my best to disappoint their justifiably low expectations.

\* 
Consider [my dissertation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/get-out-your-re.html#more).   Done?   Now consider the fact H.G. Wells wrote [a book about the future](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19229/19229-h/19229-h.htm) in which he claims nothing needs to be done about the “swarms of black, and brown, and dirty-white, and yellow people, who do not come into the new needs of efficiency,” because the ethical system of the New Republic will employ “the method that nature has followed hitherto in the shaping of the world, whereby weakness was prevented from propagating weakness” (298).   How is that _not_ social Darwinism?  Or this:

For a multitude of contemptible and silly creatures, fear-driven and helpless and useless, unhappy or hatefully happy in the midst of squalid dishonor, feeble, ugly, inefficient, born of unrestrained lusts, and increasing and multiplying through sheer incontinence and stupidity, the men of the New Republic will have little pity and less benevolence. (300)

How is _that_ not __ social Darwinism?   Because I say so.

Okay, audition’s over.  God, that sucked.  Could somebody get rid of this guy?  And get me a bottle of ice-cold water while you’re showing him the door.  No, not cold, you incompetent wretch, _ice_ cold, as in fresh from the highest peaks of the Sierras.  Wait, the literature kid is still here?  This is getting embarrassing.  Somebody call a car service already.  Before he starts to cry, okay?  And where’s my goddamn water?

_…a multitude of contemptible and silly creatures, fear-driven and helpless and useless, unhappy or hatefully happy in the midst of squalid dishonor…_

I’m new to this making shit up thing, so just so I’m clear: he’s talking about American conservatives, right?

You know, I could’ve done better if WordPress didn’t open another tab for _every single edit I made_.  My computer’s barely five months old and your blog’s already eaten all its RAM.  I can’t work on the Leading Edge Word Processor anymore!  

_That’s it_.  I’m on strike.  Who’s with me?  Vance?  Andrew?

It’s good to see your inimitable style cropping up here, Scott, where previously we had to make do with the clear and straightforward prose of the two historians.

**Vance Maverick**

In that second passage, Wells tries to say that the Untermenschen are inferior _even though_ they’re breeding.  For a Social Darwinist, that’s having the cake and eating it.

I’d probably join you in your strike if I were in the office, reading this on Firefox under Linux.  But here at home, under good old XP, it’s quite tolerable, and my solidarity has delicquesced.

Speaking of meat, elsewhere, and clear and straightforward prose, here, I just saw a commercial for _[Wanted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4pWuFv48Zk)_.  Where are the New Critics when we need them?

See, I said “New Critics.”  To make literature boy feel welcome.  I’m nice like that.  I really am.  You could learn a little something from me, Ben.

I may be a sap, but I think [this is rather well-done.

Huh, that’s pretty darned cool.  I’ll put it up as a post tomorrow, especially if you remind me.  (Unless you’ve got something to say about it, in which case send me an e-mail, and you can post.)

No, nothing coherent, just deixis.  (Parents of small children may notice a link from the Jacob Lawrence to [Ezra Jack Keats](http://www.ezra-jack-keats.org/characters/index.html).)

Ezra Jack Keats is king of the Kelman household.  Seriously, everyday is Ezra Jack Keats day around here.  Except when we make time for  [Eric Carle](http://www.eric-carle.com/home.html), whom we also revere.

**Vance Maverick**

Carle is good too.  Tangentially, every time I read his bio, I wonder what his family was up to, moving from the US to Germany in 1935, and staying for the duration.  But the books are sweet.

The Eric Carle museum in Massachussetts is a fine, fine museum.

Also popular chez nous: Arnold Lobel, [currently featured](http://www.picturebookart.org/Lobel) at the Carle museum.

I got no time for Lobel. The _Frog and Toad_ stories are just utterly, uninterestingly sappy.

Thanks, Ari, I’ll check that out.  Though the relentless mildness and sweetness of the Lobel is not (really!) as dire as TMK finds, we could use a change.

**[The Modesto Kid](http://www.readin.com/blog/blog.asp)**

Also: if you are reading Lobel right now your kid(s)’re probably a little ways away from this attention-span-wise; but Grahame’s _Wind in the Willows_ is most engaging, and features a toad.

She’s 4.  By the time she gets to WitW, I’ll be glad to let her read it alone.  And actually, she’s not interested in toads or frogs per se — what grabs her are dragons.

_what grabs her are dragons_  

Mine’s 4, too, and the mere first line of _The Jabberwocky_ sends her flying from the room with a horror movie-style scream.  I would feel bad about that, but she does always come back to hear the rest.

My prose is as clear as a diamond of the first water, Scott; should it at first appear daunting, that’s only because all the splendors of the English language scintillate in its brilliant cut.
