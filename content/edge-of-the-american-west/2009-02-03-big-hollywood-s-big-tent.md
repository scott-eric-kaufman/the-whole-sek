Ancillary to a point I would’ve made had [this](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dtennapel/2009/01/31/republican-is-the-new-punk/) been worthy of a reply:

For those keeping score at home: those are the faces responsible for everything plastered on _Big Hollywood_ as of 6:17 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.  We’ll see whether they can’t rustle themselves up a token before tomorrow.

But… they apparently have Dr. Manhattan posting.  I suppose he’s not punk, just besuperpowered.

Given that our political economy can assimilate pretty much any and every kind of resistance or transgression, the right answer to “which political party gets to claim the mantle of punk?” is “who gives a shit?”

Debbie Schussel counts twice — as the token woman, and the token lobotomy patient.

I immediately thought of [this](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/10/23/cowie).

Most people grow out of their rebellious phase.

The cognitive dissonance on display in that article is astounding, but Ahistoricality’s link is a good antidote. U2 and Springsteen as emblems of rock rebellion? More like whiny protest and faux populism. There wasn’t a hint of rebellion in any of the acts at the inauguration.

It’s weird how the wingnuts simultaneously invent stereotypes of liberals to ridicule, then attempt to adopt those same stereotypes for their own use.

The stereotype: “Liberals don’t stand for anything, they just rebel.” This becomes: “Liberals refuse to reflexively rebel against authority, like us authentic rebel conservatives.”

_Several of them look bluish to me._

Blue skin correlates well in the US to far-right political views.

A line to savor.

More broadly, I find any attempt to push “rock is rebellion” beyond metaphor breaks down fast. This attempt is especially grotesque, of course….

Pete Seeger singing the “other verses” of “This Land is Your Land.”  Look at his grin as he starts singing it.  That’s the grin of someone who answers to nobody.  

For the rest, your point stands.  But Seeger was bloody awesome.

Whadya mean, scrape up a token?  They already gotta chick, so that’s one minority right there.  Why would they need more?
