KATRINA!

[Katrina](http://moderateleft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/bush-katrina.jpg)?

KATRINA!

[_Katrina_](http://www.whnpa.org/events/bush\_katrina\_ap.jpg)_?!_

KATRINA!

_[KATRINA](http://www.first-draft.com/images/2008/05/28/brownbush.jpg)!?!_

KATRINA!

Words fail me.

Fortunately, I have pictures.   Stare at this picture:

![katrina](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/katrina.jpg?w=490 "katrina")

Now do [this Google Image Search](http://images.google.com/images?q=bush%!k(MISSING)atrina), find that picture and click on it.  I’ll wait . . .

. . .

. . .

. . . now don’t you feel better?

**EDIT:** YMMV but [I see this](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/ymmv.jpg).

Jindal’s point, so far as I could tease it out, was that “government is the problem” — it was the problem in Katrina, and it’s the problem now. So the fact that a picture of GWB being the problem now links to the smiling face of the new leader is exactly what he means to convey.

Tangentially, do those pictures of Bush in the plane looking down on Louisiana actually convey either incompetence or the reverse? They seem pretty neutral to me.

Vance, competence after the fact equals . . . (And I haven’t forgotten the posts I owe you.  I’ve just been 1. dead to humanity [via virus] and 2. slaving over more drafts than any man should bear.)

jessemerle, I hope you’re being . . . sarcastic?  Not sarcastic?  My Katrina-related humor/aggression runs so deep and black it’s difficult for me to tell sometimes.

Maybe I should ask, what do those pictures of Bush looking through the little windows, with the light of day seeping into the gloom of Air Force One, actually convey? [See](http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall/) ([via](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/elsewhere-photographers-at-the-court/)).

Of course it’s loaded, Vance, but as Morris himself would attest: some loaded pictures speak to the truth, others don’t.  I think those shots of Bush squinting through the little window from 15,000 ft. pretty well reflect the administration’s response.  I mean, the day before he was [all](http://moderateleft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/bush-katrina.jpg), but then the utterly predictable happened and he needed to show he cared.  The fact that the shots were sanctioned before and approved after the fact lend credence to the extent to which, as [Kayne said](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pVTrnxCZaQ) . . .

No offense taken (and obviously you don’t “owe” me any posts). We’re being a little too elliptical here for me to be sure we’re engaging properly….perhaps I should backtrack and speculate that competence or otherwise wasn’t the point of those photos, but rather “Message: I care”.

Hope the virus and the drafts relax their grip soon….

Yes, government is the problem.  Government caused the hurricane by building too many wind turbines.

I’m torn.  Did Jindal sound more like [Kenneth the Page](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIXyofOwUo&feature=related) or [Mister Rogers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wROwWvq6zvw)?

The one thing I haven’t heard anyone comment on was the “Oh God” that was audible right before Jindal walked into view.  I watched both addresses on MSNBC, so maybe it only happened on that channel, but it really sounded like Jindal made the comment right before he spoke, and not in the beseeching for help manner.

This one really cries out to be anatomized.

During Katrina, I visited Sheriff Harry Lee, a Democrat and a good friend of mine. When I walked into his makeshift office, I’d never seen him so angry. He was yelling into the phone: “Well, I’m the Sheriff and if you don’t like it you can come and arrest me!” I asked him: “Sheriff, what’s got you so mad?” He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters. The boats were all lined up ready to go, when some bureaucrat showed up and told them they couldn’t go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration. I told him, “Sheriff, that’s ridiculous.” And before I knew it, he was yelling into the phone: “Congressman Jindal is here, and he says you can come and arrest him too!” Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and go start rescuing people.

OK, so what’s the take-away, Bobby?

There is a lesson in this experience: The strength of America is not found in our government. It is found in the compassionate hearts and the enterprising spirit of our citizens. We are grateful for the support we have received from across the nation for the ongoing recovery efforts. This spirit got Louisiana through the hurricanes and this spirit will get our nation through the storms we face today.

OK, but what does this mean for economic stimulus planning for Lousiana?  It’s forehead-smackingly obvious: Louisianans need to start printing dollars for themselves and using them to buy things.  And if Washington calls that counterfeiting, the state can just secede and develop its own nuclear deterrent.  How’s that for a spirit of self-reliance!

Southern Juche.  The Kim Jong Il play.  The parallels can be drawn out further still: with Louisianan’s level of meth production, they could supply that drug to the rest of of the country, just as North Korea does for Japan.

Why didn’t I think of it before?

Also, ‘government’ is the problem.  The sheriff is in business for himself?  Because most places that’s a government function.

_The sheriff is in business for himself?_ 

In Louisiana, anything’s possible.

Some people just like to walk around with guns and tell people what to do, and would do so even if they weren’t being paid. It’s like being in academia: sometimes they pay you to have fun!

No dice, Ahist.  It’s just [liberal blogger B.S.](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0209/Jindal\_aide\_Story\_was\_set\_after\_Katrina.html?showall) that Bobby lied.  But since you liberals are such uber-parsers, here is the story again, with a few **boldface** grammatical filigree touches added, so that even _you_ can’t avoid the interpretation that any sensible person would arrive at.

During Katrina, I visited Sheriff Harry Lee, a Democrat and a good friend of mine. When I walked into his makeshift office I’d never seen him so angry. He was yelling into the phone: ‘Well, I’m the Sheriff and if you don’t like it you can come and arrest me!’ I asked him: ‘Sheriff, what’s got you so mad?’ He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters. The boats 
were
 **had been** all lined up ready to go – when _some bureaucrat showed up and told them they couldn’t go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration._ I told him, ‘Sheriff, that’s ridiculous.’ And before I knew it, he was yelling into the phone: ‘Congressman Jindal is here, and he says you can come and arrest him too!’ Harry **had** 
just
 told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and start rescuing people.

I can’t believe I have to spell this out for you liberal grammar nazis.  Jindal wasn’t there, except for later.  He hadn’t just ever been there, before, but he was after.  The part about how the Sherriff didn’t find out about regulatory issues with his decision until a week after the decision, about how those boaters couldn’t do what they actually went ahead and did . . . . Oh, it’s impossible to explain these things to you people, why even try?
