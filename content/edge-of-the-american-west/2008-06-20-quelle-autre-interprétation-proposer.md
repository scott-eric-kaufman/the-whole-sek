Scott McLemee [may bite his thumb](http://www.artsjournal.com/quickstudy/2008/06/the\_estragon\_code.html) at Valentin Temkine, the French schoolteacher who claims to have cracked the Godot code, but I think he’s onto something:

Godot, whom Vladimir and Estragon are waiting for, is a Resistance smuggler, who is supposed to smuggle them out of occupied France into the Italian zone. The two of them are Jews on the run who come from Paris’ 11 _arrondissement_. They are probably waiting to be rescued in the spring of 1943 on the dry, limestone heights of the Southern Alps, somewhere like the Plateau de Valensole.

My French is terrible, but here, roughly, is what Temkine says:

_Waiting for Godot_ is very nearly a fable of the occupation.  People sleep in ditches and aren’t surprised to be beaten.  A man and his servant, laden with possessions, are in flight from somewhere to somewhere.  Everything was different “a million years ago, in the nineties.”  And two people are to meet a third whom they know only by a single name, a code-name as it were; they don’t know why they’re to meet him, but it matters.  If the assignation fails they’re to try again in 24 hours, meanwhile hanging about as inconspicuously as possible.  It takes little insight to recognize details from some tale about Resistance groups[.]

Like I said, my French is terrible … which is why I quoted Hugh Kenner [recapitulating](http://books.google.com/books?id=CS7lEYCPKEUC&pg=PA290&dq=%!h(MISSING)ugh+kenner%!+(MISSING)%!w(MISSING)aiting+for+godot%!&(MISSING)ei=IP9bSKuQMYisswPetIi\_DQ&client=firefox-a&sig=3Qx\_xnNcZOSMcJWocNP\_2FuBkU8#PPA290,M1) the argument he first made in 1973’s [_A Reader’s Guide to Samuel Beckett_](http://books.google.com/books?id=J4tJAAAACAAJ&dq=kenner+%!a(MISSING)+reader%!s(MISSING)+guide+to+samuel+beckett%!&(MISSING)num=100&ei=VAtcSIXIBYGMtAODhIC\_DQ&client=firefox-a).  Few understand the compulsion to “make it new” better than Kenner — his [best work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520024273/diesekoschmar-20) embodies the ethos it describes — but enlivening moribund themes, forms or arguments entails more than mere repetition.

Because, as we all know, repetition breeds zombies.  (The unenlivened dead arise, chase away the interlopers and hold mandatory office hours, &c.)  Grouse away about [Google eating brains](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google), it _should_ have a beneficial effect on the duplication of scholarly arguments.  [See](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!w(MISSING)aiting+for+godot%!+(MISSING)occupation)?

\[_I planned on writing about someone declaring they can prove Homer was a woman, complete with links to Samuel Butler’s [**The Authoress of the Odyssey**](http://www.archive.org/details/authoressofodyss00butlrich) (1897), but it turns out someone has [already staked claim](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393057887/diesekoschmar-20) on my insufficiently absurd example.  I’m not sure whether I feel chastened or depressed, but I do know that I don’t know how to finish this post now.  I should just stop.  I can’t go on.  I’ll go on.  Or not._\]

It struck me the other day that the classic monster movies of the ’50s might have embodied our political anxieties of the day.

Much as I’d like to initiate some serial snark in which we all discover conventional wisdom — who am I kidding?

When I was writing my London chapter, I realized that _Call of the Wild_ and _White Fang_ are complimentary novels — one’s about the socializing power of civilization, the other the rapid degeneration that happens when society disappears.  

This boldly novel reading will win me tenure.

I was about to snark, then I recalled that my dissertation succeeded in putting an old debate from the 50s into contemporary terms without any additional content.  I think DARPA invented a machine for that a few years ago.

Strange, when I look at the upper left-hand column, I see two comments by Ari.  And they say there’s no conspiracy!

Well, it was new to \*me\*.  

The London thing, though, I figured out when I was like 12.  Sorry, SEK.

No problem.  Now that I have tenure, I don’t need your approval.

**[John  Emerson](http://www.idiocentrism.com/barbary.htm)**

Samuel Butler, like the vast majority of wrong-thinking people, was right. He made a fortune in New Zealand on sheep. He was sort of a gentleman, but not really. He was a confirmed bachelor. It was often or usually impossible to tell whether he was serious, for example about Homer being a woman.

**[jim](http://moody.cx)**

Scott, I’m afraid, is right.  There is a massive difference between the statements:  (1)  “Conditions under the occupation inform the _mise en scène_.” and (2) “The tramps are two Jews from the _onzième_ waiting in the Southern Alps to be smuggled into Italy in 1943.” The first is unexceptionable; the second over the top.

Note that Kenner weasels:  _Godot_ “is very nearly a fable of the occupation.”  Which means, I take it, that it isn’t actually a fable of the occupation, but that if one wanted to write one, one could use the characters, many of the scenes and even some of the language more or less unchanged.

Why the antagonism? Beckett was a [member of the Resistance](http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000433.html). That two scholars, decades apart, reach the same conclusion based on this well known biographical part. This seems, in retrospect, like a fairly obvious reading (though I never thought of it myself) but just because it’s obvious doesn’t mean that the merits and implications shouldn’t be examined. I mean, should Macbeth not be read from the theory that it was written to curry favor with the new Stuart monarch? More obscure interpretations aren’t necessarily better.

Anti-antagonism (protagonism) and Anti-obscurantism will get you nowhere here, especially in a comment about a Beckett play.
