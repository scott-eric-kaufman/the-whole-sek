In the comments to ari’s [post](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/who-are-they/), [Martin G.](http://pen-to-paper.blogspot.com/) [noted](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/who-are-they/#comment-26285) his fondness for [Bérubé](http://www.michaelberube.com/)-style _agon._  I couldn’t agree more.  That is, after all, the point of the [copy-pasta post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/the-fish-in-jon.html) everyone incidentally linked to the other day.   But a proper political _agon_ requires some ground rules: first and foremost, a commitment not to [Rorschach](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/watchmen0626.jpg) your interlocutor with a [Godwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%!s(MISSING)\_Law) to the balls.\*  Such strictures are, however, unmanly.  Manly men—[_real_ Men](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/man-books-for-m.html)—cede every ounce of their intellectual authority to the Man who wrote [The Most Important Book Ever](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385511841/diesekoschmar-20):

*   [A]s Jonah [showed us](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-583750) in _Liberal Fascism_ . . .
*   I [recommend](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=11020#comment-323651) Jonah Goldberg’s book _Liberal Fascism_ . . .
*   Why worry about people using it to invoke “Godwin’s Law”? As if that is anything more than an internet convention used as shorthand to [dismiss arguments](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-583821) like those made in _Liberal Fascism_.
*   Goldberg’s book has [opened a door](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-584623) to enlightening . . .

And when Really Manly Men are challenged, they choke back the tears, tighten the gasket on that whine, and project, project, project.  To wit:

*   The man whose posts regularly range in 4,000 word pastures [writes](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13622#comment-582112) “[a]s for SEK, he just likes to hear himself talk[.]”
*   The man who valiantly [complains](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13622#comment-582035) that others “want to freeze me out from their linkfests” [writes](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13622#comment-582123) “[SEK’s] entire blog is predicated on traffic.”

Really Manly Men don’t [care about traffic](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=6223).  [Not](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13498#comment-567635) [one whit](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13250#comment-536375).  The people who care about traffic are the ones who never mention it.  We’re all about listening to ourselves talk, ignoring the “self-” of our importance, and [guilting our readers into giving us money](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13524).\*\*  Once upon a time, I thought it possible to discuss things with Manly Men whose Knowledge and Foresight allow them to see [The Coming Socialism](http://thepoorman.net/2008/11/04/i-will-not-live-blog-i-will-not-live-blog-i-will-not-live-blog/).  Then the Manly Men drunk deeply of the Manly Book, realized the Womanly Challenge before them, and told their [less Manly compatriots](http://patterico.com/2008/11/11/ed-morrissey-lets-not-act-like-the-unhinged-left/) to [\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-584372).\*\*\*

All of which means I was as right as I was wrong: whatever you might say about the boorishness of Manly Men, they were once far less stupid.  Now that Goldberg’s spoon-fed them Kool-Aid, they feel history vindicates their abject paranoia.  The Democrats won this election cycle, certainly, but we ignore idiocy at our own peril.  I’m not saying _all_ our time ought to be devoted to slapping the sluggish—that’d leave no time to marvel at [the spectalurness of our failure](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/11/sek-and-the-cas.html)—but as stupidity trickles down, we can’t rest on Obama’s laurels.

* * *

\*Rorshach’s “power,” for those unfamiliar with [_Watchmen_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234?ie=UTF8&tag=diesekoschmar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0930289234), being raw brutality of the Pol Pot variety
.  

\*\*
Because, you know, we’re “important,” i.e. the only ones who can “break away from partisan cheerleading and closely examine the kernel assumptions of the several mainstream political ideologies in order to tease out how and why those ideologies either conform to, or break with, our founding principles.”
  

\*\*\*
And despite their hate-hate affair with their own voice, they only linked to themselves [five times](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635) while doing so.

The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, “Save us!”

…And I’ll look down and whisper, “No.”

Super manly quote from a super manly watch-man.

man, i have always had the impression that dealing with that guy is the fastest way to learn the wisdom of dogberry, who wisely saith that he that toucheth pitch shall be defiled.

weird, i was mousing over the links to try to avoid going to them, and the amazon link for jonah’s book ends “diesekoschmar”–i think that’s a euro-macaronic for “this nightmare”.

_Super manly quote from a super manly watch-man._

Except, you know, he only wanted a mommy!  (Such are the debts of hyper-masculinity.)

_Rorschach is not a hero._

I thought the Pol Pot reference would make that clear.  (That said, he’s an extremely interesting character, inasmuch as Moore’s playing with the idea of Freudianism being the gateway wound to madness.)

_SEK, pearls before swine, buddy. Unless you enjoy batting these kittens around._

This was sort of my “to my right, those capable of rational debate; to my other right, those who forgot to declare to their common sense and now believe Obama’s the next Stalin” post.  Pat Frey’s a conservative to my right with whom I happen to disagree; Goldstein’s aping his man-crush Goldberg in the monkey house, parceling the blame like so much unaimed spittle from his lips.

SEK: for the _agon_ before he was against it.

Can we _really_ trust him with our blogosphere’s slap fights?

That’s actually my Amazon code—I know, I know, **evil**, but _convenient_ thanks to Firefox—and it comes from _Pnin_:

Pnin, in silence, his face working, one palm still on the wet bar, had started to slither clumsily off his uncomfortable mushroom seat, but Wind put five long sensitive fingers on his sleeve.

‘Lasse mich, lasse mich,’ wailed Pnin, trying to beat off the limp fawning hand.

‘Please!’ said Dr. Wind. ‘Be just. The prisoner has always the last word; it is his right. Even the Nazis admit it. And first of all—I want you to allow me to pay at least one-half of the lady’s passage.’

‘Ach nein, nein, nein,’ said Pnin. ‘Let us finish this nightmare conversation.’

Hey, hey, just because he doesn’t have a power doesn’t mean he’s not a hero. Though, in Watchmen, you can argue that none of them are really heroes, due to their \*actions\* at the end.

And, I believe that our friend Walter just wanted a _daddy_, coupled with a _better_ mommy.

You and Freud both.

_Though, in Watchmen, you can argue that none of them are really heroes, due to their \*actions\* at the end._

My kids are arguing this _right now_.  (Most of them, at least.  And I’ve prepped them well, what with showing them the first few issues of _Detective Comics_ featuring Batman, in which he was a rich guy who went around beating up poor people during the Great Depression.  My students are flabbergasted by the question of who the audience for this could’ve been.)

I didn’t—Nabakov did!  The original’s “_diese koschmarische Sprache_.”

Indeed.  He’s not a hero because he’s psychotic.  (I think ‘none of them’ is generally the answer to ‘who is the hero?’, too.)

So, I take this as a continuation of Ari’s thread in which Martin G. applauded the vigilance of _agon_.  Is this remotely correct?  Not snarking, but I sometimes have trouble translating your prose into an English, the meaning of which I can understand, but if I get your drift, you are advocating commerce with those you deem reasonable and some variant of hostile response toward those you don’t.  Is this a fair approximation?

I was thinking about this whole post today and it came to me sort of aphoristically :  there’s no sense in arguing with Howard Stern,  which wraps it up pretty well for me – if they aren’t serious, don’t waste your breath, more shortly (and pithier) what Dana said.

I know nothing of the comic in question, but, in general, have we not had psychotic heroes before?

“Pat Frey’s a conservative to my right with whom I happen to disagree; Goldstein’s aping his man-crush Goldberg in the monkey house, parceling the blame like so much unaimed spittle from his lips.”

That’s what all that was about?  I clicked a few links, against my better judgement, and saw Jeff Goldstein and Patterico being mean to you and each other and generally doing what they do and I realized that this was like getting unpleasantly drunk and drinking more in the hopes that it would make sense.

Patterico is just as bad as Goldstein, you know.  The one time I commented on his blog turned into a hate-fest in which people were looking up my contact information.  He’s a Bush dead-ender and if you stick around anywhere near him, the same exact thing will happen to you as does over and over when you “engage” with these people.

_Get thee to a library!_ 

I was just looking into this. (The words seem interesting enough, if not the pictures.) But in San Francisco at least, _Watchmen_ is evidently too popular for this — 90 holds on 10 copies or so.

Go to a comic book shop and buy it.  Worth it.

_I know nothing of the comic in question, but, in general, have we not had psychotic heroes before?_

I was a little too quick.  Yes (Batman can’t be sane, really), but they weren’t really personifications of retribution like Rorschach is.

I can’t believe all these people who have never read _Watchmen.  What next — they’ll be saying they never read Gaiman’s_ _Sandman_?  Or _Hamlet_?

No Gaiman, either.  _Hamlet_ — you mean that Mel Gibson movie?

_Yes (Batman can’t be sane, really)_

He was the first one to come to mind, but then I decided I wasn’t quite sure he would qualify as full-on psychopathic, either.
