In the comments to ari’s [post](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/who-are-they/), [Martin G.](http://pen-to-paper.blogspot.com/) [noted](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/who-are-they/#comment-26285) his fondness for [Bérubé](http://www.michaelberube.com/)-style _agon._  I couldn’t agree more.  That is, after all, the point of the [copy-pasta post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/the-fish-in-jon.html) everyone incidentally linked to the other day.   But a proper political _agon_ requires some ground rules: first and foremost, a commitment not to [Rorschach](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/watchmen0626.jpg) your interlocutor with a [Godwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%!s(MISSING)\_Law) to the balls.\*  Such strictures are, however, unmanly.  Manly men—[_real_ Men](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/man-books-for-m.html)—cede every ounce of their intellectual authority to the Man who wrote [The Most Important Book Ever](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385511841/diesekoschmar-20):

*   [A]s Jonah [showed us](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-583750) in _Liberal Fascism_ . . .
*   I [recommend](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=11020#comment-323651) Jonah Goldberg’s book _Liberal Fascism_ . . .
*   Why worry about people using it to invoke “Godwin’s Law”? As if that is anything more than an internet convention used as shorthand to [dismiss arguments](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-583821) like those made in _Liberal Fascism_.
*   Goldberg’s book has [opened a door](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-584623) to enlightening . . .

And when Really Manly Men are challenged, they choke back the tears, tighten the gasket on that whine, and project, project, project.  To wit:

*   The man whose posts regularly range in 4,000 word pastures [writes](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13622#comment-582112) “[a]s for SEK, he just likes to hear himself talk[.]”
*   The man who valiantly [complains](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13622#comment-582035) that others “want to freeze me out from their linkfests” [writes](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13622#comment-582123) “[SEK’s] entire blog is predicated on traffic.”

Really Manly Men don’t [care about traffic](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=6223).  [Not](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13498#comment-567635) [one whit](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13250#comment-536375).  The people who care about traffic are the ones who never mention it.  We’re all about listening to ourselves talk, ignoring the “self-” of our importance, and [guilting our readers into giving us money](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13524).\*\*  Once upon a time, I thought it possible to discuss things with Manly Men whose Knowledge and Foresight allow them to see [The Coming Socialism](http://thepoorman.net/2008/11/04/i-will-not-live-blog-i-will-not-live-blog-i-will-not-live-blog/).  Then the Manly Men drunk deeply of the Manly Book, realized the Womanly Challenge before them, and told their [less Manly compatriots](http://patterico.com/2008/11/11/ed-morrissey-lets-not-act-like-the-unhinged-left/) to [\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635#comment-584372).\*\*\*

All of which means I was as right as I was wrong: whatever you might say about the boorishness of Manly Men, they were once far less stupid.  Now that Goldberg’s spoon-fed them Kool-Aid, they feel history vindicates their abject paranoia.  The Democrats won this election cycle, certainly, but we ignore idiocy at our own peril.  I’m not saying _all_ our time ought to be devoted to slapping the sluggish—that’d leave no time to marvel at [the spectalurness of our failure](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/11/sek-and-the-cas.html)—but as stupidity trickles down, we can’t rest on Obama’s laurels.

\*Rorshach’s “power,” for those unfamiliar with [_Watchmen_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234?ie=UTF8&tag=diesekoschmar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0930289234), being raw brutality of the Pol Pot variety
.  

\*\*
Because, you know, we’re “important,” i.e. the only ones who can “break away from partisan cheerleading and closely examine the kernel assumptions of the several mainstream political ideologies in order to tease out how and why those ideologies either conform to, or break with, our founding principles.”
  

\*\*\*
And despite their hate-hate affair with their own voice, they only linked to themselves [five times](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13635) while doing so.
