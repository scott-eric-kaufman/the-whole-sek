## Arguments against (dissertations as) vanity publishing

Tracking down a citation for the still unfinished dissertation of mine, I came across the title of a book likely to be sufficient.  The book had the title of __ [_The Comprehensive History of Psychology_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/8120808045/diesekoschmar-20).

“I only need to know what the _e_ and _b_ in the initials of E.B. Titchner’s name stand for,” I thought to myself.  “So the first link to a book returned by Google Book Search should be ample discrimination for my scholarly purposes.”

When I read the “[Brief Life-Sketch of Edward Bradford Titchner](http://books.google.com/books?id=dXZnwvs6gYIC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=%!e(MISSING).b.+titchner%!&(MISSING)source=web&ots=GVe7YJL1pC&sig=NvoXvtF01fdTx6J45uEGHNbWCI4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA122,M1)” I learned I was wrong.  A discriminative act resulting in this book lacked sufficient discrimination.  What I learned was:

Titchner was born in the English town of Chichester.  His family had little money.  With the help of scholarship, he got admitted into Malvern College and then entered into Oxford University from where he took his bachelor’s degree.  This also completed his training as a physiologist.  But he was dissatisfied with what he had learned till now.  Therefore, he went to Germany at Leipzig University to get training with famous Wilhelm Wundt.  He studied with Wundt for 2 years, that is, from 1890 to 1892 and obtained his doctorate degree in 1892.  His dissertation was on binocular effects of monocular stimulation.  Although Titchner spent only two years with Wundt, he (Wundt) made a great impression on him—an impression which was never obliterated.

After returning from Leipzig, Titchner became an extension lecturer of Oxford.  He would have liked to remain at Oxford but the English were not ready to show any sympathy or even were not ready to accept the “new” psychology of Titchner.  Therefore he decided to immigrate to America at Cornell University where he remained for the rest of his life, that is, for nearly thirtyfive [_sic_] years.  […]  During his thirtyfive [_sic_] years [_sic_] brilliant career at the Cornell University [_sic sic sic_], he established his system, wrote articles and books and guided research students.  […]

During the last years of his life, the interest of Titchner turned from psychology to numismatics or coin collecting.  He died in 1927 probably [_!_] due to a brain tumor.

Although Titchner was such an Englishman who never gave up his British citizenship, he was very Germanic and much like his teacher, Wundt, even in having a beard [_!_].

Knowing that someone, somewhere thought this should be published is a powerful mental enervation.  I can finish the dissertation which will have been written for seven years, that is, from 2001 to 2008.  Then I think I should compose a profoundly amusing quiz for you readers in which I present passages about Francis Galton, cousin of the famous Charles, from my Twain chapter alongside excerpts from this book and have you guess what is their origin.  Here are two sentences maybe or maybe not written by me:

Like Darwin, [Galton] also believed in these families in past there must existed a great variations of mental abilities and the outstanding ones were able to survive and pass on to the next generation.

Despite his misgivings with the efficacy and applicability of analysis as means of identifying criminals from a database of strangers, for the time he worked under the inspirational thrall of the book, he it seems had adopted the applied essentialism of its argument.

Which one do you think wrote which?  I decline to answer because the results of my experiment may cripple me with the depression.

The first one is bad, but the second one isn’t so hot itself, so I’ll say that hopefully you didn’t write either.

If, however, you wrote the second, I hereby offer my editorial services. Reasonable rates.

You wrote the first sentence, right?

Fun game!  Good times!

oh, i’d a said it was obvious that the second was yours, from an unrevised draft. the first makes mistakes that are characteristic of a non-native speaker of english, as does the tichner excerpt. the second sounds like a native speaker, just one who needs to revise out the jargon.

_I can finish the dissertation which will have been written for seven years, that is, from 2001 to 2008._ 

Surely this is the length of the doctoral program, right, not the diss?

I agree with kid, because the word order in the first looks like it belongs to another language.

Ever the follower, I’m going to have to agree that the second paragraph is yours.  And if it’s not quite up to your usual standard, you can take some solace in the fact that a dissertation is only, after all, a draft.  You’ll have plenty of chances to revise in the coming years!

_You’ll have plenty of chances to revise in the coming years! [/sunny optimism]_

It’s touching that you find this optimistic.

SEK, I don’t think you need to revise out the jargon from the second sentence (I only count one piece, anyway), just to change some words. ‘with’ s/b ‘about’, insert ‘a’ before ‘means’, ‘for the time’ s/b ‘while’, move ‘it seems’ before ‘for the time/while’ (and insert ‘that’), drop ‘inspirational’.

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

That was too easy, it seems.  Yes, the second sentence is mine — like many recently drafted sentences I write, it lacks prepositions and conjunctions.  Apart from removing “inspirational” — it’s one of two words Twain used to describe _Finger Prints_, the other being “thralldom,” so doubling down there makes sense — I like Matt’s advice.  (Not to mention the show of faith in my ability not to have composed the first sentence.)

And dana, yes, that’s my time in the program.  But it seems like I’ve been writing the dissertation the whole time, somehow.  I blame exotic physics.

A follow-up: I don’t want to sound defensive, but where’s the jargon in the second sentence?  I’m hoping it seems jargony because it’s out of context, but (he says, in dissertation voice) as I demonstrate, Twain followed Galton in the belief that fingerprint analysis had some serious flaws — so-called “doubtful fingers” liable to be interpreted by different analysts differently due to slopey whorls and whorly slopes — so there’s the “efficacy.”  And _Pudd’nhead Wilson_ shows the limitations in its applicability, since it takes a, well, here’s the graph:

Pudd’nhead Wilson could be considered a philosophical experiment of fantastic generosity: it is not Bertillon’s Paris or Galton’s London, but Dawson’s Landing, a small town where the appearance of one woman of unknown provenance and two tourists with pretensions to minor royalty is cause for alarm and sensation.   For decades, its chief litigator has collected, indexed, and archived the fingerprints of everyone in town; moreover, he “often studied his records, examining and poring over them with absorbing interest until far into the night” (21) and can recognize the prints of some community members on sight.  Grant this town all these advantages—a perfect storm of print evidence, archival availability, and uncommon powers of observation—and the identification of a criminal via print analysis still (and again) depends on a guilty party calling attention to a deformity visible to naked, untrained eyes.

The “(and again)” is a reference to an episode in _Life on the Mississippi_ in which fingerprint identification takes the back seat to a missing thumb.

Or is it the “applied essentialism”?

he wasn’t sure it would work, or would work on a large database of strangers. but he never questioned the book’s premise that the print is essential to the person.

I think you wrote the second one, while very tired.  I’ve done much the same.  I once at 6 AM declared that the Declaration of Independence was a “connoted literary work.”

Jargony? The two consecutive and long dependent clauses sound very academic. Actually, it might be more effective to make the first independent, perhaps by deferring “despite” to the beginning of the following clause: “He had misgivings about … Despite these misgivings, though, so long as he worked…”

And “efficacy and applicability” sound like the kind of writing Edward Said used to call “bone-jarring.” Try “He felt analysis was neither effective nor applicable to identify criminals…”

(And then we ask, “How can analysis not be applicable?” Why don’t you just cut “applicable”? Can you tell I used to work in a writing center?)

But this is a dissertation! You’re not writing for fourth-grade readers. Just finish it.

M-wei has identified the necessary changes; it’s not jargony at all.

My first thought, after having cosinged you to the second passage (the first one doesn’t read ESLy to me, just poorly constructed; undergrads write like that all the time), was that it seemed like a victim of sentence compression, repack it into two and you’ll be happier and suffer less arm-strain as you carry them out to your car.

Yeah, I think it’s the “applied essentialism” that sounds like jargon, as though it were a specific term that I/we just aren’t familiar with.  I suspect, though, that you meant it as a straightforward descriptive modifier, in which case it seems like an unnecessary distinction.  In context it probably sticks out less.

Smooth over as best you can and be done.

**JPool:** _the first one doesn’t read ESLy to me, just poorly constructed; undergrads write like that all the time_

I won’t speak to the first part of that, since there are likely more ESL teachery situations than there are teachers, but I have to lurch at the second half. Really? You get undergrads, native speakers, who write like that? I teach nothing but freshmen, and I’ve never encountered that kind of writing outside of a second-language situation. I’m not saying it’s not possible–I’m just wondering what situation produces that.

yeah, jargony is probably not the right way to say it.

but the important thing is: you’re not trying to win style prizes. make the changes matt w says, and it will be perfectly fine. finishing is the only thing that matters here, not what random jerks on the internet think about your prose style.

Jason B: I think you must teach in a rare and wonderful place.  Not only have I run into EFL undergrads who have turned in prose like that, _I_ have first drafts that look exactly like that, because I’ve accidentally left words out or composed sentences from two directions and not yet gone back in and smoothed them down.  Thankfully, I’ve slowly learned to revise and improve my muddles; undergrads, particularly procrastinating sleep-deprived ones, not so much.
