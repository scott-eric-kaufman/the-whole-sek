On this day in 1907, the second greatest proselytizer for the strident, oversimple libertarianism of high school debaters, Robert Heinlein, was born.  Second only to [_The Fountainhead_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452286751/diesekoschmar-20) in importance to adolescent males whose genius isn’t appreciated by authoritarian parents, [_The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312863551/diesekoschmar-20) informs readers [_How [to] Find Freedom in an Unfree World_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452286751/diesekoschmar-20): chunk definite articles, catapult space rocks at Middle America, and embrace Ho Chi Minh.  As my colleague [Adam Roberts](http://adamroberts.com/) [argues](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/moonisharsh.htm):


We might take this further, a note the many parallels between the ‘Loonies’ and the Viet-Cong. Heinlein may have been a pro-war signatory on the famous Galaxy double-page Vietnam advertisement, but his sympathetically portrayed, anti-American Loonies, who are essentially farmers, and who live in elaborate tunnel-systems that prove impossible for invading troops to infiltrate, have much in common with the South-Eastern enemy. More to the point, the whole scenario of a war between Earth (a large, populous, technologically-advanced world) and the Moon (a small, technologically-backward nation of farmer struggling for independence) presents a penetrating commentary upon the international events of 1966.

This is not Bob Barr’s Bob Heinlein.  Granted, it’s a damned clever interpretation, but I’m more inclined to agree with my colleague [Adam Roberts](http://adamroberts.com), who [claims](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333970225/diesekoschmar-20) that after 1960, Heinlein sacrificed the virtues of his early work

to a strident, even desperate ‘puppet-master’ authorial persona, which harps incessantly and sometimes unpleasantly on a narrow range of ideological concerns: the importance of individual liberty conceived in the American libertarian mode, with a pendant mistrust of ‘government’ and a fetishisation of authority as such.

Difficult as it for us, as adults, to read novels in which characters break the fourth wall to deliver lectures about politics, the anti-authoritarian appeal of the libertarian rants of Heinlein’s not-even-veiled surrogates shouldn’t be overestimated, as the only alternative explanation for his continued popularity among the adolescent set is that 70 percent of his work is _made of fucking_.\*

Not just any old fucking, though, but [_polyamorous-underwater_-fucking](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441788386/diesekoschmar-20), a practice whose appeal to bookish 16-year-old minds can’t be exaggerated.  There’s also plenty of [rape-fucking](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034530988X/diesekoschmar-20), which is mildly disturbing until you remember that by novel’s end it becomes _marriage_ fucking, at which point you overdose on disturb and vow never to use your penis again.  Especially when compared to the [respectful, nuanced treatment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/comic\_book\_rape.html) of rape by _Chris Claremont_.  The mind reels.\*\*

My point, as you’ve probably surmised, is that this day in 1907 saw the birth of an author whose adolescent philosophy was disseminated in books chock-a-block with puerile male sex fantasies, a fact Penn & Teller would call bullshit on except, [you know](http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/penn-teller.html).

* * *

\*Hence the title of the post, borrowed from a letter 
Joseph
 [**John**](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/i-wish-that-son-of-a-gun-would-take-that-other-hand-out-of-his-pocket/#comment-14287) W. Campbell, arguably the most powerful editorial voice during the Golden Age of science fiction, to Isaac Asimov:

I’ve got a Bob Heinlein novel on hand now [_The Door Into Summer_], for decision, that’s got me worried and bothered. Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish that son of a gun would take that other hand out of his pocket.

\*\*I know, I know, this is a family blog.  But there’s no other word for what Heinlein and adolescent males the world over fantasize about.

I’ve never read any Heinlein, but I’m for any post that uses “_The Fountainhead_” and “strident, oversimple . . . adolescent” in the same paragraph.

**[CJS](http://coyotebanjo.com)**

					

		

Yep, I’d have to agree about Heinlein. He could spin a yarn, and he had a remarkable ability to draw male (and female) characters who adolescent males would find incredibly appealing–but the bastard was a perpetual adolescent himself. Like Rand, one hopes to outgrow those kind of fantasy projections.

_Do you maybe not mean John Campbell?_

I did.  Problem was, when I consulted Adam’s _History of Science Fiction_, I couldn’t resist rereading his damning-with-faint-praise account of Lucas.

_Not just polyamorous-underwater-fucking, but time-travelling incestuous fucking. I mean, the guy wrote an entire goddamn book on the theme of incest. WTF?_

I had a whole bit about Lazarus Long and what would compel someone to write a novel in which the near-immortal protagonist made the exact same mistakes like clockwork every sixty years for 700 pages, but then I thought, “That’s piling on.”

Given these as primary materials, I’d like to posit the thesis that the Heinlein _oeuvre_ features much coition.  Could I get a dissertation out of that?  Assuming I use the word “_oeuvre_,” I mean.

Heinlein went from writing completely chaste boys adventure novels that happened to be set in space to writing weird sex romps and odd satires of religion.  

urbino, I think that is worth a couple of Ph.D. dissertations, at least.  And, hey, you get to spend lots of time in Santa Cruz reading the man’s papers.  What better place to read about odd sex and weird religion?

_Heinlein went from writing completely chaste boys adventure novels that happened to be set in space to writing weird sex romps and odd satires of religion._

Probably due in large part to the changing market and his relationship with his editors.  IIRC, all of his juveniles were sold to the same publishing house and edited by the same woman.  Once he got big enough that he could branch out, he was free to write what he wanted.

And the juveniles weren’t \*completely\* chaste.  He still managed to sneak the occasional sexual reference in.

Why do I know this?

Considering that the revolution would have most likely gone nowhere without [Mycroft Holmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycroft\_Holmes\_%!c(MISSING)omputer%!)(MISSING), I wonder what part the computer would play in the Viet Nam analogy; or the libertarian aspect, for that matter, as they can hardly be accused of being self-reliant.

As someone who enjoyed _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, as well as _Job_ (one of his “odd satires of religion.”), I should say that it is possible to read and enjoy this fiction without a perfervid over analysis ruining it.  Just like I enjoyed the cinematic “Fountainhead” even though I find Mrs. Rand’s philosophy over-simplistic twaddle.

What a very sad neo-Puritan pronouncement. But in my adolescence fucking wasn’t fatal.

I can tell y’all for a fact that _Stranger_ was just as popular among females as among males back in the mid to late 60’s. 

Yeah, Bob got tedious later on, but Valentine Michael Smith was a true culture hero for a while. Of course, like I said, back then fucking wasn’t fatal.

““the famous Galaxy double-page Vietnam advertisement” Huh?”

_Galaxy Science Fiction_ was one of the major genre magazines of the 1960s.  A bunch of people took out a double-page ad to express support for American involvement in Vietnam, and Heinlein was one signatory.  ‘Famous’ may overstate the case here, I concede.

Mind you, that first paragraph of mine SEK quotes is sloppy stuff: “We might take this further, **and** note  … have much in common with the South-**East Asian** enemy …”

If I recall, I read a late Heinlein book and noticed, oh, after a few pages into the first chapter, that perhaps his editor was taking advantage of an oldster in the throes of senility.

I haven’t read it in a million years, but I think _Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ was actually a pretty good book.

While as a teenage boy I appreciated the 70%!f(MISSING)ucking plot of _Stranger in a Strange Land_, the asymmetry of the fact that the women would sleep together but the men wouldn’t bothered me.  It didn’t really make sense in the context of the novel.  But this probably means that I hate sex.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

Yeah, Walt has it.  Older guy sleeping with lots of younger women while no older woman gets to sleep with lots of younger guys is just a repeated accident of Heinlein’s books — nothing to see here — and if you don’t like it, you hate sex.

“I can tell y’all for a fact that Stranger was just as popular among females as among males back in the mid to late 60’s.”

And a lot of my best friends are black.  If you say anything about 60’s racism that wasn’t seen as racism at the time — that even may have been an advance over old-style 50’s racism — they’ll get on your case.

Heinlein (like many other authors) is/was a wildly mixed and not entirely savory bag in terms of personal philosophy.  Also, toward the end of his career he wrote with both hands in his pocket too much of the time, recycling characters (particularly Woodrow Wilson Smith, aka Lazarus Long) and working out his twin fascinations with incest and solipsism.  That said, I’ve found much to enjoy in his novels and stories over the years and a few things to admire, cherish and even pass along to students.  His short-story-within-a-novel, “The Man who was Too Lazy To Fail,” (Time Enough for Love) seems therapeutic for students weho think that they have to make much obvious effort (hence spin their wheels).  Also, his late novel “Job: A Comedy of Justice,” holds up pretty well.  No trace of any of the Howards in there and as a critique of the “bottom line” of any faith claiming a special dispensation, it’s pretty sharp.

So, was he great?  at times.  Was he a hack?  at times.  Could he write a mean story?  More often than the rest of us, I’d say.  One interesting observation I’ve seen elsewhere is that in the 1930s he was something of a lefty-progressive, as was his second wife Leslyn.  After he remarried, he turned toward the libertarian right, where he mainly stayed for the rest of his days.

Thanks for the link to the Panshin, which I plan to read today. Yesterday I read 300 pages of Thomas Disch SF criticism, and while Disch mostly agrees with the crowd, he did give _Friday_ a good review. I haven’t read _Friday_, and with the exception of _Time Enough_ didn’t read any Heinlein written after 1965. I won’t claim the “Lifeline” thru 1965 stuff is much more than the juvenelia Disch as describes it, much of it politically offensive, but I wouldn’t tear _Double Star_ or the _Green Hills of Earth_ collection from my adolescent’s hands in horror.

12-yr-olds read some dreck, and there is worse out there than early & mid period Heinlein.

PS:I do like me a preview.

Browsing these books in Amazon, I keep clicking “Surprise Me!”, but it doesn’t seem to work.  In any case, this has reminded me of reading _I Will Fear No Evil_ when I was 7 or 8, a memory I had essentially buried (though scanning it now, a surprising amount seems familiar).

PS:Having just finished Disch on SF, I think it is important to understand that all of the New Wave (Disch, Delany, PKD) started off as adolescents with the Golden Age writers:Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, Van Vogt and probably the 2nd wave of the early fifties, and chose to make the writing of SF a career. Delany specifically mentions two Heinlein influences:the black protagonist of _Starship Troopers_, and “the door dilated”. Since both Delany & Disch emphasize the unity of style and content in writing, and that “ideas” are only words + reader’s imagination, I might suggest that the wide open possibilities of what could be done with language in SF was a critical factor in their decisions.

Of course, some people in the 50s probably read Costain and Ross Lockridge and became different kinds of writers.

Heinlein certainly had a formula that worked well for his readership (for many of the reasons mentioned). And at times I think it really came together well on many levels (_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ is my personal favorite of his). But in the end I think it was mostly just adolescent pseudo-libertarian wish fulfillment with a surprising authoritarian streak masked as meritocracy (and even Mistress had lots of that, he just pulled it off in an amusing over-the-top way. Fatuous stories like “The Roads Must Roll” are his tell.

_Stranger_ is certainly an interesting artifact and a telling one with an interesting reception, but in the end I think it supports SEK’s thesis.

Incidentally, Ray Davies is doing a series on Frank Tashlin’s 50’s unsuccessful transition from animation to film that may be relevant.  

SF is poetry, most of it very bad, but all of it, like Coleridge’s Xanadu, using language to create impossible images in the reader’s mindseye. I should quote Panshin to explain what Heinlein did in 1939-41 that laid the essential ground for all the better writers to follow. But just look at his stories of the period and compare them to Verne, Wells, Stapledon, EE Smith, Campbell and you might see how important he was. And he hadn’t even reached his peak.

Hmm, wonder if those are what [this seemingly rather complete FAQ](http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/rahfaq.html#0302) is referring to here:

_Note: The two girls’ stories (“Cliff and the Calories” and “Poor Daddy”) were long believed to have been written under a pseudonym. They were not, and it is amusing/amazing that no one discovered them prior to Heinlein’s inclusion of the first in Expanded Universe._

It shows them as being published as R A Heinlein.

_What a very sad neo-Puritan pronouncement. But in my adolescence fucking wasn’t fatal._

I do believe this is the first time anyone’s accused me of being neo-Puritan.  How does one frame a comment?  

_He sneers at Heinlein’s sexual philosophy through the entire piece_

To get technical, I allude to it in the title then spring it on you in the third-to-last graph.

If you think I’m being a Puritan because I point that there’s oodles of sex in books beloved by adolescent males for what they claim to be purely philosophical reasons, you’re missing the point.

The book I read yesterday was _On SF_, 2005 which seems, from the ToC, to share content with _Dreams_, but not completely. I am a little confused.

Still reading the Panshin, which I have probably read before, but don’t remember. In further defense of Heinlein, Henry at CT is asking for suggestions for books on American politics. If we look at American novels about process, politics, revolution, ideology, there are famously very few good ones written after WWII. Okay, maybe a lot, Vidal, Robert Stone…

But anyway, there are so many SF novels and stories that have political main themes or subtexts (world building, how does a matriarchy work, etc) that it is hard to imagine the genre without it.  

There are certainly other antecedents for imaginative political fiction, but Erewhon and Brave New World are not as readable and entertaining as Pohl & Kornbluth or Banks or (cast of thousands).

That’s because of Heinlein. Just give it up. He is a giant of the century.

PS:My guess is that Henry would rather read Caro or Perlstein than _Camp Concentration_ and _334_ on the 60s. He is wrong.

**bob mcmanus**

					

		

_so I don’t know what bob is worried about._

Oh, the importance of Heinlein to post-WWII American speculative political fiction. Peter Nichols devotes a full page before he even gets to genre material.

1) Genre vs non-genre. Is _It Can’t Happen Here_ “SF?” There were shelves of speculative political fiction written in the 20s & 30s (and after) and Roberts might want to expropriate it as apparently Nichols does. I am a genre guy, and consider the genre superior, at its best, to what is outside the genre. Roth sucked, and letting him in will ruin the neighborhood.

2) John Campbell. I was trying to remember for instance how political, in the sense of how do we get together to solve this problem, _The Black Star Passes_ is. It is hard to separate the influences on genre of Heinlein and Campbell in 39-42.

3) What is “political fiction” anyway? Is _Camp Concentration_ a political novel? Exactly how did early & mid Heinlein add politics to his fiction in a less obstrusive way (sometimes) that made say _Left Hand of Darkness_ and _Triton_ possible?

Long and hard arguments, for which I am underqualified.

Rich Puchalsky: “Older guy sleeping with lots of younger women while no older woman gets to sleep with lots of younger guys is just a repeated accident of Heinlein’s books”

Erm, what? Take another read through, oh, _To Sail Beyond The Sunset_, or perhaps _The Number of the Beast_. Both books do feature older women sleeping with younger men. Not as a central theme of the story, mind you, but then again, neither was sex between people of different ages the central theme of _Stranger In A Strange Land_.

And for the record, I’m female, in my mid-forties, politically liberal/progressive/left (I came here via [Making Light, which probably tells you something) and think the Vietnam war was a huge mistake (though obviously I was rather young when it was actually in progress). I might well have clashed with RAH over political philosophies and any number of other things, had I been afforded the opportunity to discuss anything with him at all, but I can certainly appreciate a good yarn when I read one.](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/)

3b would be my thesis, that Heinlein improved/created? the craft of using world-building (speculative socio-politics) as background to related but partially independent narratives, thereby creating SF as we know it today, beyond the nonsense of EE Smith and the tedium of Bellamy. For SEK, I know of Sea Wolf, Iron Heel, & Martin Eden. They only show how hard it is to maintain an entertaining balance.

_I dunno where this is coming from_ 

Okay, I’ll play, it’s part of my job description. I thought your interest was professional, searching for topics and sources for the next book or paper. Now I suppose I could imagine a peer-reviewed paper using Delany, Dick, and Disch etc as primary or secondary sources being accepted by a history or political science journal or department, but it is quite a stretch.

Perlstein I presumed used Abbie Hoffman (and Chicago Seven?) because there were the kind of primary sources (there were 375 articles in 456 newspapers saying blah blah) that are considered professionally responsible, acceptable.

Now the SF New Wave’s rise & fall 65-75, along with the similar and related arcs in music and movies is a part of the story, but a hard one to connect to the politics in a tight and defensible thesis.

Go for it, since you say your sympathetic to the idea. I look forward to reading the work.

SEK, Your post is a simple hatch job, starting with a title drawn from a John W. Campbell quote. Heinlein and Campbell parted acrimoniously because Campbell was, to put it plainly, a controlling prick and Heinlein ‘dumped’ him because of that.

The tenuous linkage to Rand, a narcissistic psychopath, is a reach to say the least. Heinlein was certainly bombastic and opinionated, but he never got close to Rand’s hated of just about everybody and everything. And he never manipulated the people in his personal life with anything like to Rand’s evil machinations. 

The rest of your rant [which it clearly is] seems lifted from Mr. Robert’s book of Sci-Fi criticism, which no one on Amazon seemed to have enough interest in to bother reviewing. Is that ad hominem? Yeah, pretty much, but I’m just following the path you’ve laid out in that regard.

The entire tone here positively drips with personal enmity toward Heinlein, who probably could have gotten as much young pussy as Charles Bukowski. That’s why I wondered if you fucked at all. You seem rather frustrated.

OK – it sounds like you misunderstood my post. I wasn’t looking for help with a new academic project; instead, I was saying that now I was finished with one, I wanted good reading recommendations to fill in the vast gaping holes in my knowledge of US history, politics etc. Hence, Disch etc would work very well (and in any event, I have plugged SF authors like Ken McLeod in ostensibly dry pieces of political theory, as well as writing a forthcoming book chapter on the political science of China Mieville, so there you go …)

“And he never manipulated the people in his personal life with anything like to Rand’s evil machinations.”

Heinlein once loaned PKD a fairly substantial sum of money to tide him over past some crisis, which PKD was quite grateful for.  Given that PKD is the secular saint of contemporary haute SF readership, I don’t think that people would dismiss Heinlein as a personal devil.

**bob mcmanus**

					

		

Heinlein also gave Sturgeon 26 story ideas and a check.

As far as the break with Campbell, Panshin (linked above) has a lengthy discussion of the economics of genre writing. Post-WWII Heinlein could sell stories to Boys Life and the Saturday Evening Post at higher word rates, and the “juveniles” novel contract with Scribner’s gave him financial security for the rest of his life. My guess is that, with the tougher magazine competition of the early 50s, this is part of the reason Campbell felt betrayed by Heinlein’s abandonment of the short story/serialization format.

SEK didn’t say anything that isn’t true (though I would reverse the importance of Rand and Heinlein myself): scratch an American libertarian and you’ll find a Heinlein reader underneath. 

The great secret behind Heinlein’s succes even when his writing became increasingly awful is that the man could sell shit for shinola better than any other writer.

Agreed. That said, I’ve met very few ‘American libertarians’ who have his sense of personal responsibility and honor. They’re almost all talk. But then I guess most folks are….

But my real Sci-Fi heroes are [Cordwainer Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordwainer\_Smith) and [Olaf Stapledon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf\_Stapledon), who seem to have been forgotten by everybody, much to our collective loss.

Nebris, I’m not actually new to this Internet thing.  It’s just that the low level of discussion that the Internet can sustain actively irritates me.  I know, God given right, blah, blah, blah, but have you achieved anything?  You’ve irritated a bunch of total strangers, and convinced them you’re a big weirdo.  Have you defended Heinlein at all?  Does anyone have a higher opinion of Heinlein than before you commented?  Bob has posted a detailed defense of Heinlein that has a chance of changing people’s opinions.  You’ve done nothing except increase the amount of hostility in the world.

Since you admit that most libertarians are Heinlein readers, the only way you don’t agree with me _vis-a-vis_ the Rand/Heinlein/libertarian connection is if you deny _Rand_ is a libertarian favorite — and I can’t see you making that particular argument in good faith.

That Campbell’s statement was based upon personal enmity, not actual fact. I’ll drop that one because it is pretty ‘yes it is/no it isn’t’ unless we devote time and effort that we both can spend better elsewhere.

_the four hundred million billion lists of best libertarian fiction_

Libertarians are delusional fruit cakes. Not the most profound of political arguments, but I suspect it’s one thing we both agree upon.

Therefor I dismiss their collective opinions on ‘literature’ as irrelevant, hence the Rand/Heinlein connection is bogus.

_You should come over here, Scott._

As soon as I find money and a job, I will come visit you in the land of sexual repression, Adam.

_That Campbell’s statement was based upon personal enmity, not actual fact._

They were still friends at the time he wrote this, having reconnected after a five hiatus.  Plus, it’s verifiable — there is _a lot_ of plot-unnecessary copulating in Heinlein novels:

Man wakes up.  Thinks to himself, before I get on this spaceship to kill nasty aliens, I fancy a fuck.  But who is available?  Three big-breasted bisexual beauties magically appear.  

“Would any of you fancy a fuck?” 

“No,” they reply, “we _all_ would.”  

Group sex ensues.

&c. 

_Therefore I dismiss their collective opinions on ‘literature’ as irrelevant, hence the Rand/Heinlein connection is bogus._ 

This bar is so low I’m liable to trip over it:

That quote, from a man so proud of his love of freedom he once joked that “Ayn Rand is a bloody socialist compared to me,” shows yet another side to the Heinlein paradox. As a literary influence on the emerging libertarian movement, Heinlein was second only to Rand.

_Stranger was a major element in starting the modern polyamory movement._

_That particular oversight makes all your ‘ick’ noise sound even more juvenile._

I’m the actual only person who said the word “ick.”  I also wager that I’m the only person here who has an open relationship.

I think the key to why that’s the case might be here:

_He sneers at Heinlein’s sexual philosophy through the entire piece; “this day in 1907 saw the birth of an author whose adolescent philosophy was disseminated in books chock-a-block with puerile male sex fantasies”._

See, “puerile male sex fantasies” /= sex.  Or even a defensible sexual philosophy.  Sorry.

_As a literary influence on the emerging libertarian movement, Heinlein was second only to Rand._

Hell, I would say he was first. The importance of those brilliant Scribner’s juveniles, never out of print, and suffused with Heinlein’s philosophy, cannot be overestimated.

I have tried to avoid discussing the politics of Heinlein in this thread, and as I said _Stranger_ , Mi&gt;Glory Road , and especially _Farnham’s Freehold_ were more than I could take, and ended my reading. He was elitist and authoritarian in his libertarianism.

And I have long realized my left libertarian anarcho-syndicalist whatever is incomprehensible and unwelcome to the fanatical worshippers of the STATE that are the left blogosphere.

But there is a place where my vision of egalitarian communities collides with some suspicion that a leader or dominant personality or heirarchy will always arise (Mosca, Pareto), and there I still have some empathy with Heinlein. I just hate it. Hate it hard.

Which may explain a little of my antipathy to Obama, a walking demonstration of the truth of classical elitist pessimism.

“left libertarian anarcho-syndicalist whatever”

Who are the left-libertarian anarcho-(socialist, at least) SF writers?  Iain Banks, first.  Arguably Michael Moorcock.  Alasdair Gray?  I forget whether he’s an anarchist.  China Mieville is left, but probably not anarchist enough.  Ken MacLeod  always struck me as being a bit right-libertarian somehow, but I think he’s left-libertarian.

British SF has a much more robust tradition and body of currently writing good writers for that kind of thing.

Umm…ya better stick to your day job, sir.

I love Bob’s quote, “I’m so much a libertarian that I have no use for the whole libertarian movement.” That goes back to “Libertarians are delusional fruit cakes.” The philosophy fails utterly in the face of Corporate Fascism….but that’s a can of worms I shall steer away from right now.

What actually warms my mad little heart is that the Reason article confirms what I love about the man and pretty much pisses upon your dismissive snarkage e.g. “The man was brilliant and changed the world for the better”. Thanks, pal.

Culturally, almost all the Scottish SF writers mentioned above are radical socialists of one stripe or another, which is, I think, the important thing. They’re not left-libertarians; they’re radical socialists who reject state-capitalism.

Thus do I cut the Gordian Knot of MacLeod, who veers between Maoism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, Fabianism, and occasional attacks of the Californian Ideology in a political sense, but always remains _culturally_ safely ensconced in the radical Scottish socialist tradition.

Gray’s certainly not an anarchist, and I’d be quite suspicious about putting Banks as an anarchist as well.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

They’re all Scottish SF writers?  It’s a serious question — is there something about the specifically Scottish socialist tradition that writers not born in Scotland would be immersed in?

Banks may or may not personally be an anarchist, but given that he’s written a popular, well-written, and long-running series featuring the anarcho-socialist Culture, I think that he qualifies as writer of anarcho-socialist SF.

Also, did I miss anyone?  I’m always looking for more of these sort of writers.

I am reading Dennis Showalter’s “Little Man, What Now? Der Stuermer in the Weimar Republic” and on page 113, after detailing one of Streicher’s attacks on a Jewish business, in this instance for giving away free paint because it was a scam designed to fool good Germans into buying more paint, Showalter writes that this argument “prefigur[ed] Robert Heinlein in its insistence that there was no such thing as a free paint job . . . ”  Not sure what this means, but

I wonder if Nebris really departed?  

Anyway, (s(doubtful))he seems like a person who was personally affected by Heinlein’s sexual philosophy (not so much the libertarianism) and thus takes a great deal of offense when it’s described as puerile.  Kind of missed the point that Scott isn’t objecting to the sex in Heinlein, nor even necessarily the kinds of sex or sexual relationship but instead the fact that it’s used essentially as “fan service”.  

The only Heinlein book I ever finished was I Will Fear No Evil which I picked up when I was a preteen, honestly looking for an interesting book about gender and sexuality, and even then I put it down thinking that it was more preoccupied with having the main character fuck everyone than it was with actually saying anything.

Can’t tell if you lost something here or just dropped a

 _period_, but the answer’s from _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, in which Heinlein popularized the phrase [TANSTAAFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TANSTAAFL), or “there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”

Dang, but this is annoying, I read the whole thread and managed not to remember a single line from RAH’s works and now, thanks to TANSTAAFL, the whole of that dopey book is lodged foremost in the brain and, making matters worse, the line from the Scandahoovian “Send us hors tausends and tausends, and I’ll marry em I betcha” repeats over and over in the persona of the aunt from the film version of I Remember Moma who kept threatening to yump in the bay, which is just weird howsoever properly polyamourous.

Re punctuation, a comma perhaps as it is a dependent clause although my larger point, to the extent that there was one and there wasn’t really, was odd juxtaposition Julius Streicher and Heinlein.

Banks, Gray, and MacLeod are Scottish, while the rest aren’t.

Charles Stross is another Scottish resident who also plays with anarchism and socialism in some of his works.

I think that Scotland produces good socialist writers because (a) Alasdair Gray, and (b) Scotland has been historically quite left wing, especially the industrial belt from Strathclyde through to Fife\*, so most Scottish writers are leftish anyway.
