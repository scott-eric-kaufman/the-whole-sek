On this day in 1907, the second greatest proselytizer for the strident, oversimple libertarianism of high school debaters, Robert Heinlein, was born.  Second only to [_The Fountainhead_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452286751/diesekoschmar-20) in importance to adolescent males whose genius isn’t appreciated by authoritarian parents, [_The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312863551/diesekoschmar-20) informs readers [_How [to] Find Freedom in an Unfree World_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452286751/diesekoschmar-20): chunk definite articles, catapult space rocks at Middle America, and embrace Ho Chi Minh.  As my colleague [Adam Roberts](http://adamroberts.com/) [argues](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/moonisharsh.htm):


We might take this further, a note the many parallels between the ‘Loonies’ and the Viet-Cong. Heinlein may have been a pro-war signatory on the famous Galaxy double-page Vietnam advertisement, but his sympathetically portrayed, anti-American Loonies, who are essentially farmers, and who live in elaborate tunnel-systems that prove impossible for invading troops to infiltrate, have much in common with the South-Eastern enemy. More to the point, the whole scenario of a war between Earth (a large, populous, technologically-advanced world) and the Moon (a small, technologically-backward nation of farmer struggling for independence) presents a penetrating commentary upon the international events of 1966.

This is not Bob Barr’s Bob Heinlein.  Granted, it’s a damned clever interpretation, but I’m more inclined to agree with my colleague [Adam Roberts](http://adamroberts.com), who [claims](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333970225/diesekoschmar-20) that after 1960, Heinlein sacrificed the virtues of his early work

to a strident, even desperate ‘puppet-master’ authorial persona, which harps incessantly and sometimes unpleasantly on a narrow range of ideological concerns: the importance of individual liberty conceived in the American libertarian mode, with a pendant mistrust of ‘government’ and a fetishisation of authority as such.

Difficult as it for us, as adults, to read novels in which characters break the fourth wall to deliver lectures about politics, the anti-authoritarian appeal of the libertarian rants of Heinlein’s not-even-veiled surrogates shouldn’t be overestimated, as the only alternative explanation for his continued popularity among the adolescent set is that 70 percent of his work is _made of fucking_.\*

Not just any old fucking, though, but [_polyamorous-underwater_-fucking](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441788386/diesekoschmar-20), a practice whose appeal to bookish 16-year-old minds can’t be exaggerated.  There’s also plenty of [rape-fucking](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034530988X/diesekoschmar-20), which is mildly disturbing until you remember that by novel’s end it becomes _marriage_ fucking, at which point you overdose on disturb and vow never to use your penis again.  Especially when compared to the [respectful, nuanced treatment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/comic\_book\_rape.html) of rape by _Chris Claremont_.  The mind reels.\*\*

My point, as you’ve probably surmised, is that this day in 1907 saw the birth of an author whose adolescent philosophy was disseminated in books chock-a-block with puerile male sex fantasies, a fact Penn & Teller would call bullshit on except, [you know](http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/penn-teller.html).

\*Hence the title of the post, borrowed from a letter

I’ve got a Bob Heinlein novel on hand now [_The Door Into Summer_], for decision, that’s got me worried and bothered. Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish that son of a gun would take that other hand out of his pocket.

\*\*I know, I know, this is a family blog.  But there’s no other word for what Heinlein and adolescent males the world over fantasize about.
