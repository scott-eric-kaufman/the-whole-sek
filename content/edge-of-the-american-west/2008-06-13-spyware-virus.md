While this is highly amusing, it made me worry that there might underlie it a shred of truth….here’s hoping your chapter has not in fact been bemalwared.

I lost about 15 minutes worth of material … or about three and a half words, two of which I’d already decided to delete.

Someday, say in 2073, your commitment to carry on working in the face of malware attacks and pop-up offers for drugs and porn will seem really heroic.  Almost as inspiring as writing without notes, from memory, at a POW camp or [being forced to edit your brilliance, due to a paper shortage.](http://books.google.com/books?id=t4VE-o27YigC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=karl+popper+paper+shortage&source=web&ots=1j4cuxy\_jv&sig=MQm2-xBaeuUF6VxWue0p9XQ-UFs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=4&ct=result)

Seriously, though, I hate when computers conspire against us.

Also, I trace my codependent relationship with my computer to too many hours of [Zork]() and [Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy]() during a particularly formative period of my life.
