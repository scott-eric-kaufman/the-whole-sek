Over at [my other digs](http://www.thevalve.org/), I’m hosting a book event on Jenny Davidson’s [new book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231138784/diesekoschmar-20).  Many of you will (or should) be familiar with her from her blog [_Light Reading_](http://jennydavidson.blogspot.com/), which is like [_Arts & Letters Daily_](http://www.aldaily.com/), only good.  You can read three-ish chapters of _Breeding_ [online](http://books.google.com/books?id=7P4lD6wDhkUC&dq=%!j(MISSING)enny+davidson%!+(MISSING)breeding&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=ejqlCr4\_Zn&sig=uYvWsZv766WVKw84UKFVphBozDQ&hl=en&ei=q-4aSo6ZBor8swPX6KnBCA&sa=X&oi=book\_result&ct=result&resnum=9#PPT1,M1), and you should—especially if you’re [a fan of John McPhee](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/on\_the\_form\_of\_jenny\_davidsons\_breeding/).

I’m contributing a couple of posts, all of which relate to what [Eric said about my work way back when](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/panel\_podcast.html): that there’s a way in which intellectual history straddles the border between literary studies and history, and that you historians have an obligation to make sure us literary rubes do a decent job of it.  (I’m paraphrasing.)
