You’re good people—known quantities, at least—so I’m thinking I might could [let you in on a little a deal](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/old\_concerns\_addressed\_anew\_on\_academic\_reviewing\_then\_now\_and\_later/).  Little more formal than we are here, but lots of familiar faces.  You think this might be something you could be interested in, send me an email and I’ll see what I can do.

Also, someone asked why I didn’t x-post [my remembrance of David Foster Wallace](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/theres-too-much.html) over here.  Short answer: I’m trying to do something about stuffing Vance’s reader with three versions of the same post, and that one seemed personal, so I kept it over there.  I can repost here if there’s demand.  The link’s probably sufficient.  But if you’re interested in Wallace memorials, [Scott McLemee](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2008/09/17/mclemee) and [Kathleen Fitzpatrick](http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/in-memoriam/)‘s aren’t to be missed.
