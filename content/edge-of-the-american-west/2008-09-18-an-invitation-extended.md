## An invitation extended

You’re good people—known quantities, at least—so I’m thinking I might could [let you in on a little a deal](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/old\_concerns\_addressed\_anew\_on\_academic\_reviewing\_then\_now\_and\_later/).  Little more formal than we are here, but lots of familiar faces.  You think this might be something you could be interested in, send me an email and I’ll see what I can do.

Also, someone asked why I didn’t x-post [my remembrance of David Foster Wallace](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/theres-too-much.html) over here.  Short answer: I’m trying to do something about stuffing Vance’s reader with three versions of the same post, and that one seemed personal, so I kept it over there.  I can repost here if there’s demand.  The link’s probably sufficient.  But if you’re interested in Wallace memorials, [Scott McLemee](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2008/09/17/mclemee) and [Kathleen Fitzpatrick](http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/in-memoriam/)‘s aren’t to be missed.

That seems like a very good idea, Scott.

Over at ScienceBlogs they’ve been pushing a project called [Research Blogging](http://researchblogging.org/static/index/page/about). I don’t know if they’re concept of research extends to literary work, but it might be worth checking out.

Thanks, ben — wait, you were talking about my linked idea, not the whole triple-x-posting thing?  (Although they’re both good ideas to my mind.)

I’ve been keeping tabs on that, and I like the idea.  This would be more like “Review Blogging,” though — at least, this particular idea.  I do need to keep closer tabs on Research Blogging, though, since a friend of mine is one of the people pushing it.

_I’m trying to do something about stuffing Vance’s reader with three versions of the same post_

Really there are worse inconveniences than having to press the spacebar twice more.

Scott,  

In my day job as a publicist for a university press, I can’t be anything but excited about this. As Ari and Eric can tell you, I’m all about sending out review copies to people who can bring attention to books in promising new ways.
