The [Institute for the Future of the Book](http://www.futureofthebook.org/)‘s [Golden Notebook Project](http://thegoldennotebook.org/) went live today.  Here’s the Institute’s Bob Stein on it:

On November 10th, The Institute for the Future of the Book kicks off an experiment in close reading. Seven women will read Doris Lessing’s _The Golden Notebook_ and carry on a conversation in the margins. The idea for the project arose out of my experience re-reading the novel in the summer of 2007 just before Lessing won the Nobel Prize for literature. _The Golden Notebook_ was one of the two or three most influential books of my youth and I decided I wanted to “try it on” again after so many years. It turned out to be one of the most interesting reading experiences of my life. With an interval of thirty-seven years the lens of perception was so different; things that stood out the first-time around were now of lesser importance, and entire themes I missed the first time came front and center. When I told my younger colleagues what I was reading, I was surprised that not one of them had read it, not even the ones with degrees in English literature.  It occurred to me that it would be very interesting to eavesdrop on a conversation between two readers, one under thirty, one over fifty or sixty, in which they react to the book and to each other’s reactions. And then of course I realized that we now actually have the technology to do just that. Thanks to the efforts of Chris Meade, my colleague and director of if:book London, the Arts Council England enthusiastically and generously agreed to fund the project. Chris was also the link to Doris Lessing who through her publisher HarperCollins signed on with the rights to putting the entire text of the novel online.  

Fundamentally this is an experiment in how the web might be used as a space for collaborative close-reading. We don’t yet understand how to model a complex conversation in the web’s two-dimensional environment and we’re hoping this experiment will help us learn what’s necessary to make this sort of collaboration work as well as possible. In addition to making comments in the margin, we expect that the readers will also record their reactions to the process in a group blog. In the public forum, everyone who is reading along and following the conversation can post their comments on the book and the process itself.

I don’t believe the effort’s [entirely unprecedented](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/adam\_bede\_conclusions/), but it’s the sort of endeavor (and meta-endeavor, if you will) that we can and should throw our weight behind.  I’ll say more as the project progresses, as the novel falls victim to [the five year rule](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a\_very\_unfunny\_.html) twice-over.

How interesting. I read it for the first time about 
a year
 five years ago…suffice it to say that it fell for me in that middle ground of evaluation that makes further comment most interesting.

“Thropple,” according to that [other Scott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter\_Scott), means “to strangle with violence” or somesuch.  (I’d been reading Scott at the time and, well, love rare words.)

Came to us as “throttle”?

Me too! Maybe time to reread _The Golden Notebook_. The design of the project site is pretty interesting, with reader notes showing up in the margins as you turn the pages of the book — I hope there is also a way to read the notes as a stream of text, with links to the book pages they reference.

I was happy reading Bob Stein’s bio at the IF:book site, to find out that he is the founder of the Criterion Collection series of DVD’s — Criterion has been responsible for  a good share of my viewing pleasure over the last few years.

I’m really horrible about literature (I haven’t read any non-diss or teaching stuff in years), but this makes me want to read along.  I’m especially psyched about rediscovering Laura Kipnis, who I’ve had a post-it in my brain about ever since reading her fabulous essay in that uneven Grossberg and Nelson collection lo these many years ago.

Something missing in the description: the answer to “why read closely?” Also missing, definition of “close reading.” I was once drummed out of a graduate seminar because I argued you couldn’t read Eliot’s Middlemarch properly without understanding the Corn Laws. As I stood in the hall, I wondered if I was right or only perverse. 

I read somewhere–where the hell was it–that novel readers were more moral than non-novel readers because the act of making an unfamiliar story familiar increased the capacity for empathy. It was some sociological study, so it must be true!

BTW, Lance Maverick is the coolest name ever. You mother must have been a novel reader.

_I read somewhere . . . that novel readers were more moral than non-novel readers because the act of making an unfamiliar story familiar increased the capacity for empathy._

There is quite a bit of work going on about this (see the postings over at onfiction.blogspot.com, for instance–or, for unbridled idealism, the project initiated at UMass called “Changing Lives Through Literature”). I always wonder how much it matters _which_ novels you read (actually, with or without the Corn Laws, I’d make the case that reading _Middlemarch_ is morally beneficial…).

The technology for this project really is interesting.

I’ll second that.
