Life-altering erudition in honor of [Britney Spears of his day](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/this-is-how-ver.html) can be found [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=z7dCAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=oxford+lectures+1905&num=100&ei=lBvHSMiYA4u8tAOV4LjXDA&client=firefox-a#PPT1,M1).

I don’t know about you, but I’m a changed man.

(I should start [a series](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/thank-god-for-a.html).)

Try going to the main page for the book, then through the Contents — like [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=z7dCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5&client=firefox-a&source=gbs\_toc\_r&cad=0\_0).  Can’t guarantee it, but it’s working for me at the moment.

Do you really think he was the most important intellectual of the nineteenth century?  Or was he the _leading_ intellectual of the nineteenth century?  I suppose such questions indicate only one thing:  I should read more of your stuff.

I eventually figured it out, Vance.  (I was looking for the Romanes Lecture for the same year.)  What’s peculiar is the 90-odd page raping of a digital forest that follows the actual text.

_Do you really think he was the most important intellectual of the nineteenth century? Or was he the leading intellectual of the nineteenth century?_

I don’t think there’s any doubt that he was the brightest light in the post-1860 Anglo-American world.  I don’t go into too much depth about that in my dissertation — was told not to include too much intellectual history lest I anger Louis Menand\* — but the quickest way to show the breadth of his influence (as well as the porous nature of disciplinary boundaries at the time) is to track how William James used him.  ([Discussed here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/painstakingly\_c.html#comment-27185436).)  The short version: James taught the same course on Spencer in each of Harvard’s fledgling departments during their inaugural years.  The long version (in abbreviated form): 

Darwin was a controversial figure, Spencer wasn’t.  Spencer thought he was Darwinian, but he was Lamarckian.  Spencer’s version of evolution is what infiltrated every discipline.  Darwin’s light waned until 1890, briefly waxed again because Weismann [de-tailed mice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August\_Weismann#Weismann\_barrier:\_Cutting\_off\_mice\_tails), then so hard that Vernon Kellogg’s verdict in _Darwinism Today_ (1907) was, in essence, there isn’t any.

\*Or turn off literature departments wanting to hire me.  Same difference.

I assume you’ve memorized the above two paragraphs — minus the Menand stuff — and you can defend them.  Because if I’m on a hiring committee, I’m liking what I’m seeing up there — even if I want to say\* that you’re too quick to dismiss Darwin’s influence.

\*  But won’t, because you know more than I do.

_you’re too quick to dismiss Darwin’s influence._

This is the whole crux of my dissertation.  People think otherwise because, well, to quote a soon-to-be Doctor of Philosophy:

Whig historians of the Darwinian Revolution published after the entrenchment of the Modern Synthesis—the coupling of Darwin’s theory of natural selection and Gregor Mendel’s theory of genetic inheritance—and applied to the development of evolutionary theory the very element Darwinism famously denied: teleological progression.  The Modern Synthesis frustrates attempts to assess the impact of evolutionary theory because it retroactively vindicates Darwinian and neo-Darwinian thought.    That is, because Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Simpson incorporated Darwin’s mechanism of speciation into the Modern Synthesis, the social and political theories of evolutionary thinkers who challenged Darwin have been, if not outright forgotten, largely relegated to the odd footnote in an otherwise triumphal history of scientific progress.

Then I say some stuff about Hofstadter retroactively justifying the New Deal by creating nineteenth-century bogeymen, when in fact he’s really only talking about William Graham Sumner and Carnegie.

(But yes, with the memorizing, because what I say’s much more cogent than what I’ve written.)

Holy shit, teo, it certainly is.  I grabbed the link from my notes without checking the page.  I lined up material that didn’t go to JSTOR or ProQuest for a dissertation reading group I was in way back when.  Looks like I ought to check my references before linking . . . and I would’ve, had I not spent the evening checking my references and wasn’t aghast at the thought of doing so for fun.

X-posted at your other place.

I was just reading about something connected to this last night. Maybe it’s an answer to your WTF about the NYT article about Spencer’s bad day. It’s from “William James: In the Maelstrom of Modernism” by Robert D. Richardson (p.443). “In December Herbert Spencer died, and James — in luck for once — furnished the New York Post with a long piece on Spencer he had written nine or ten years earlier, when Spencer was thought to be dying.”

I figure that Spencer wasn’t the Britney Spears of his day. Instead, he was the Generalissimo Francisco Franco, whose protracted death was played for yucks for weeks on SNL back in the day.

That qualifies on the Spencer and pic scores, but we’ll have to get a ruling from the judges as to whether or not it’s of junk.

There’s always [this](http://www.spencergifts.com/), for those of us who grew up in the 80s.

Urbino, it’s definitely of junk, though not of Spencer’s junk.

Andrew, that passage is an example of how rapidly Spencer dated — fifty years later, likewise ex cathedra, we hear of “[the obvious fact that art never improves](http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html)“….

ah fuck.

this makes me realize that for a long time i have not really bothered to keep two separate dossiers for herbert spencer and oswald spengler.

not that i have had the occasion to actively confuse them–neither is part of my active vocabulary. just that in passive reception i have lumped them together somehow.

Shows how out of touch I am — I was unaware that the B-word was still in use as a descriptor for what Monty Python called the “naughty bits.”  Takes me right back to 6th grade…

kid bitzer, I \*would\* have said, “Beaver,” but I thought the point of this humorous post was how difficult it is to work around the word, “Beaver.”
