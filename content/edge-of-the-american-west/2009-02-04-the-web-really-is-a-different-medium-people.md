We rightly complain when Google and company generate inappropriate ads—be they on a [video](http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p48/fmello/ironic\_ads.jpg?t=1233774145) of the recent BART tragedy; a firsthand account of the [the US Airways crash](http://propr.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/advertising-fail-090115.jpg); a search for [certain keywords](http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/cnn-steroids-search.png); an [LGBTQ site](http://www.bilerico.com/2008/10/Picture%!p(MISSING)ng); or a report of a [gruesome death](http://www.ntk.net/2003/01/31/dohnohands.png).  Happens all the time.  So often, in fact, you almost miss it when someone’s being deliberately crass.  To wit:

Seems the editors of the _Daily Press_ [thought it best](http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/virginia/dp-virginiatech-slaying0123jan23,0,5572031.story) to accompany their article about the graduate student beheaded with a kitchen knife with _a photo-essay about professional knife sharpeners sharpening kitchen knives_.  Not that they shouldn’t run a photo-essay about one of the few growth industries we have left—but you think _someone_ on the editorial staff would consider not linking to this particular photo-essay from this particular article.

To be boring about this…it looks as though that site is designed so that the “This Day in Photos” box appears alongside every article, with the current top photo displayed in the box. As I write, for example, it shows high school athletes.

So yes, to avoid this, they should identify all potentially offensive combinations of stories and photos, and ensure they can’t arise. And for this investment of editorial and technical effort, their reward will be…?

I’m still getting the knife sharpener.  I’ve actually done a little behind-the-scenes work with online newspapers, so I know enough to know this: they can—and many do—vet the overall page layout.  Someone has to post the article to the internet, and when they do, they’re asked to put an editorial eye to the whole page, make sure there’s nothing like this on it.  It’s cagier with Google Ads, but from what I’ve read, Google vets ads to prominent sites in order to avoid obvious blunders.  Not that they don’t happen, mind you.

Gee, SEK, everyone knows you use a serrated knife for decapitation. That advertiser is going to be pissed he was paying a premium.

Still high-school athletes for me — what do you see [here](http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/dp-local\_russo\_0204feb04,0,327777.story)?

[Very odd](http://acephalous.typepad.com/1.jpg).  Did I maybe get results?

After the Animal thing, I think everyone’s taking your claims of web wackiness with a grain of salt, SEK.

The use of “Chinese” to characterize music as unpleasantly weird (or weirdly unpleasant) is fairly common. Negative reviews of the Ravel String Quartet alluded to its “Chinese” character and Cab Calloway fired Dizzy Gillespie for disobeying his order to “stop playing that Chinese music in my band.”

_Linsey Barker, the graduate student representative on the school’s Board of Visitors, said the killing stirred memories of the mass killings on campus on April 16, 2007. While it’s painful to recall the massacre, she said, the shootings also brought students closer._

It’s wasteful to use mass killings to bring solidarity.

Now that’s the Daily Mess I remember from my wasted youth. 

Someone thought they were making a funny.

Alright, that was just funny, it was.  I mean, NoScript suddenly started blocking the _OED_.  How was I to know?  This, on the other hand, might be your basic targeted web-vertising nonsense.  That said, the fact that they [pulled the picture](http://acephalous.typepad.com/1.jpg) on that article means I’ve done my bit of good for today.  (I’m still seeing what I saw this afternoon: the caption sans picture.  Maybe you’re seeing differently.  Suppose this falls under “the internet will offend us individually” clause.)
