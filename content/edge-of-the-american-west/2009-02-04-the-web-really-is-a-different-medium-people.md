We rightly complain when Google and company generate inappropriate ads—be they on a [video](http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p48/fmello/ironic\_ads.jpg?t=1233774145) of the recent BART tragedy; a firsthand account of the [the US Airways crash](http://propr.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/advertising-fail-090115.jpg); a search for [certain keywords](http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/cnn-steroids-search.png); an [LGBTQ site](http://www.bilerico.com/2008/10/Picture%!p(MISSING)ng); or a report of a [gruesome death](http://www.ntk.net/2003/01/31/dohnohands.png).  Happens all the time.  So often, in fact, you almost miss it when someone’s being deliberately crass.  To wit:

Seems the editors of the _Daily Press_ [thought it best](http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/virginia/dp-virginiatech-slaying0123jan23,0,5572031.story) to accompany their article about the graduate student beheaded with a kitchen knife with _a photo-essay about professional knife sharpeners sharpening kitchen knives_.  Not that they shouldn’t run a photo-essay about one of the few growth industries we have left—but you think _someone_ on the editorial staff would consider not linking to this particular photo-essay from this particular article.
