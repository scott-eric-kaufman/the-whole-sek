If you’ve not seen [this masterpiece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i-OWDjOQfI) from MSNBC, enjoy.

I’d heard about this video: “Burn the books! … the brainwashing books.”

Damn.

By “perish,” you mean… die? We’re going to _die_?

I… there are no words.

Yes, yes, funny stuff that.  But let’s be fair.  How many of us have been at a left-wing event and had to sit politely through announcements from the ISO (or other sectarian socialist organization) and the Green Party?  I’ve certainly been at things where the clear lunacy of my fellow protesters (or fellow activists) has made me extremely uncomfortable, but for the sake of not disrupting an event, not breaking a coalition, just not being rude, I’ve not done anything.  True, I can’t think of anything as crazy as the idea that digital-to-analog TV adapters are brainwashing machines, but I think the analogy holds.

ps. I’m not equating the Green Party with the ISO.  I’m suggesting that the Constitution Party is analogous to the ISO and the Libertarians analogous to the Greens.

We need a tag for these posts: “SEK is shocked, shocked, to find that there is rightwing lunacy on the internet.”

_True, I can’t think of anything as crazy as the idea that digital-to-analog TV adapters are brainwashing machines, but I think the analogy holds._

So, the analogy holds, even though the analogy doesn’t really cover this situation or explain anything?

Good to know.

I wonder if in fifty years this will be a bit of trivia/urban legend, like people who were scared of fluoride in the water.

There are embarrassing lefty loons. But at least they know better than to call their protests “teabagging.”

Dana, it’s all part of the communist conspiracy.

I am nostalgic for the days when “communism” meant evil gymnastic machines and Russia and big honkin’ nukes, not “a top tax rate lower than the top tax rate under Reagan.”  Among other things, the new communists make horrible villains for spy novels.

Frankly, Kevin, I’m with The Howler, Bob Somerby, on this.  That is hardly a masterpiece.  More jejune than anything.

_“SEK is shocked, shocked, to find that there is rightwing lunacy on the internet.”_

Point the first: I’m never shocked, mostly just amused.

Point the second: I’m totally adding that tag.

Jacob’s analogy holds nicely and explains quite a lot, Ahist.  The scene is indeed reminiscent of any sectarian-attracting event left or right, including the awkward bit at the start with the awkward dudes from the Libertarian and Constitution parties.  Jacob is picking up on the way the room responds to them; the Bircher is plainly bumming a number of people out.

I would additionally defend analogizing between the Bircher and all kinds of conspiratorial leftism — the same conviction that there are dark forces maneuvering and profiting, the same seizing on little details and names, the same obsession with “the media” to explain your own political failure, the same paranoid reading of chance events and details back into some master plot unfolding over time.

I should have gone ahead with my original plan just to change and add the tag as meta-commentary!

so does this guy claim that tv is a mass brainwashing device?

cause if he does, then i’m with him. i mean, he’s nuts and all, but right about that.

i would view the embedded link, only tv is a mass brainwashing device.

and i’m pretty sure this clip has no muppets.

When I read “ISO,” I immediately think of these people:

  [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm](http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm)

 Obviously, it is all part of the vast conspiracy seeking to subvert our traditional devotion to furlongs per fortnight…

It’s the set-top decoder box, Kid.  Wrap it in several layers of aluminum foil as a precaution; the shield works better if it’s grounded.

not so fast, awb; you’re not going to trick me that easily. 

trying to get me to watch tv, huh?   

now i know you’re in on the brainwashing conspiracy, too.

it makes me sad.

When Bachmann’s brave stand against a global currency was in the media, someone in a comment thread somewhere suggested that we spread a rumor that the new currency is going to be called the “soros”.

Guess they don’t know that the HD signal was being developed before and during Reagan’s administration, and was field tested under Bush 1. My father field tested the signal down in North Carolina in 1986.  Brain washing. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. And so they shall be exposed for the insignificant loons that they are.

Obama plays the long game, Sara.  Reagan and Bush 1 were just pieces on the chessboard.
