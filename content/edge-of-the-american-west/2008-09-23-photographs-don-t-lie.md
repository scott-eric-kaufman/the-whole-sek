All that talk about [Bush being Batman](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/27/teddy-in-tights/)?  I think conservatives may’ve been right.

Consider [this AP photo of Bush and Ari Fleischer](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/more-false-adve.html#more) exiting the White House on their way to arrest John Walker Lindh in December 2001.

To be brutally honest, I’m not sure how we missed this.

UPDATE:  What?  You wanted I should link to [the non-action shot](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/batmanserial2.jpg)?
