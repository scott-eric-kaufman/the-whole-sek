## Coalitioning?

So I’m mini-hiatus bound — dissertation to be “finished” this week, whatever that means — but I’ve run face-first into a vocabularian’s nightmare.  I need to talk about disparate political interests uniting under a common banner _a la_ the Republican Party, but because I can’t slip into German I’m hard-pressed to find a verb that adequately accounts for “the processual quality of coming together for pragmatic political reasons.”

The word I need is “coalitioning,” but that’s not a word so much as a monstrosity.  The root of “coalition” is “coalesce,” _i.e._ “to cause to grow together, to unite, combine.”  Only “coalesce” doesn’t connote the unhardy politics of “coalition” my argument requires.

I think I’m stuck re-verbing a previously nouned verb to get my point across.  Next thing you know, I’ll be redeconstructionating the phallologodiscursive elementalariness of _das Ding_ and then why haven’t you shot me already yet?

Suggestions as to how I might forestall death please?

convergence? Strangebedfellowing?

I have no idea how to answer your question but I see that you have truly hit the wall all of us on this side of the dissertation know about in that you have come to believe that it is beyond important to get this one word right.

My advice? Relax. Finish the darn thing ASAP. And take a nice little elitist vacation here in Hawaii.  I hear all the kewl kids are doing it.

What exactly is wrong with “forming a coalition”?

The fact that I’m even asking that question probably means that it’s a good thing I didn’t go to grad school, doesn’t it?

I was just about to make the same suggestion as Josh. 

Then again, I do have recourse to German in my dissertation, and it’s not helping much, so.

“Caucusing” would do it, if you were talking about politicians at least. You know, like “the black caucus” or “that RINO is caucusing with the Democrats”.

Just hand the damn thing in with the word missing.  You’ll fill it in later.  It’s not like your committee’s going to read it, anyway.

Oops, did I say that out loud?

Well, processual makes me cringe.  I suspect that if someone reads it, they might understand coalesce to be, as it is in fact, more catholic than you have assumed.  My Webster’s Third has two examples that both imply weak or transitory coalitions.  If you feel that ‘to coalesce’ remains too strong, why can’t you modify it with a nice adverb  like ‘weakly’, as in ‘to coalesce weakly’  ?

I’m in line with Josh and Blume, except I was going to say “forging coalitions,” because the metaphor’s got that “welded together but might be a little fragile at the seams” quality.

Having actually completed a dissertation, I can assure you that when you look back at it in a few years, you will regret just about every word choice you made, and wonder how you could have wasted so much time making such bad decisions.  So you should probably stop thinking about it now.  I mean NOW.

_Pick something, carry on, and file the diss.!_

This appears to be the emerging consensus.  Except dana; she’s doing her own thing.

I await an answer to Josh’s question, which seems pretty reasonable.

Plastered together? (Or plastering together.)

I’d say Popular Fronting, but it sounds like a thing someone would do to you on the subway.

_‘congealed into a wobbly coalition.’_

For some reason this reminds me of the fried eggs in _Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_.

[I had ‘allying with.’]

Maybe I was thinking of “cobbling together.”

That’s Popular _People’s_ Fronting. Splitter.

Forming or forging a coalition.

On some deep aesthetic level, I just don’t get the intense impulse to avoid phrases.

“Dangerous liaising,” maybe?  Or, “hiding under the big tent”?

Nah–Josh had it right. “Forming a coalition” will get the job done and as one of my diss committee members reminded me (frequently), “the best dissertation is the done dissertation.”

“Stapling together.” 

My gut feeling says this word choice will be crucial when they are assessing the thesis, SEK. If I were you, I would spend lots of time on it and get it just right.

I would say “factionalism,” but that’s not necessarily political nor is it necessarily processual. I agree with Martin G. I’d like to see what you come up with.

“burying the hatchet in the ground instead of in each other’s skulls (for now)”

Hemlock, I went with [Mayhew](http://jonathanmayhew.blogspot.com/)‘s [recommendation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/coalitioning.html#comment-126063822).

And zz, I’m _trying_ to put it bed, but it keeps waking up, demanding water, a story, potty time, another story, and now warm milk.  _WE DON’T EVEN DRINK MILK.  WE’RE LACTOSE INTOLERANT._  And yet, it demands.  How can I not oblige?
