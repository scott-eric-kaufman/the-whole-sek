So said Eddie Izzard on the BBC’s election coverage.  We have [a holographic will.i.am](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deoOTqT-SMI)—they have [_Eddie Izzard_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEx5G-GOS1k).  American is still an imperfect nation.  Moreover, Warren Ellis [informs me](http://twitter.com/warrenellis/status/990721348) that Simon Schama lit into John Bolton on the BBC last night.  Reviews of Schama’s performance from footballer sites seem to confirm the majesty of the humiliation.  It went something like this:

Schama camps it up to annoy Bolton.

Schama rubs up Bolton a treat.

Bolton looks like Schama stole his wife and insulted his ‘stache.

Schama itches to give Bolton’s face a good pummeling to with his biro.

Schama talks to that Bolton twunt like he is a child. 

Schama leaned
 right into Bolton’s face like a drunken auntie coming on to a vicar.

Schama broke Bolton’s mind.

Bolton throws his toys fully out of the pram.

Schama and Bolton have disappeared.

Bolton’s probably bludgeoning Schama to death with his shoe in the toilets as we speak.

You can witness a bit of it about 3:32 into this clip:

Sorry, didn’t mean to step on your post.  I moved my bit of silliness to a slot later in the day.  Carry on and keep up the good work.  Cheerio.

Is Sen. Obama’s election to the presidency an argument for or against American exceptionalism?

I saw it all . Ha ha ha ha ha ha!! (Overall the Beeb’s efforts were a bit shite, to be honest; still, Schama was splendid and Bolton was an utter twat. Most entertaining.)

Mind you, _the_ moment of the Beeb’s coverage (apart from That One himself, obviously) came when Dimbleby attempted to interview Gore Vidal. I can’t describe it, except to say that Vidal succeeded in rendering everyone in the studio temporarily speechless. No idea if there’s a clip out there. But it was priceless.

[Direct link]() to the 3:32 mark. ([Explanation](http://mashable.com/2008/10/30/youtube-deep-link-playback/). I’m not sure you can embed it this way, but it’s still pretty cool. I should probably watch the video now.)

That wasn’t very much lighting-into, though Bolton sure was spouting some idiotic shit.

TF @3:11 — it may suggest that we no longer lag far behind other countries in the implementation of American ideals.

[Vidal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2L8iUHZ2sY).  He seems a bit, er, past it, sadly.  But then, he’s seemed a bit past it for quite some time.

Any way to get all of Schama’s bits for this broadcast or, a transcript somewhere?

Vance – 

 Thanks for the response – not to get all triumphal or anything, but is there another western democracy where a mixed race/minority/child of immigrant(s) has reached the highest elective office?

 I can’t think of anyone fitting that bill in the anglophone or iberophone “nations of immigrants” (Argentina, Australia, Brazil Canada, Chile, etc.)…

 Fujimori in Peru?

 Dunno if the “immigrant” criteria really allows the question to be asked in other the other major democracies (UK, France, Germany, India, Japan, Israel, etc.)…

David Lloyd George; Ramsay MacDonald, Gordon Brown; all minorities in the UK. Disraeli was Jewish, and Disraeli took office not that long after Jews were allowed to sit in Parliament. 

NZ had a Maori acting PM in the early part of the twentieth century; Sarkozy’s dad was a Pole. Blum was Jewish.

That’s off the top of my head.

Mendes-France too, right?

I was attempting dry humor, but the examples are not hard to come up with.

OK, you got me, but I didn’t realize literal-mindedness was the order of the day…good to know. I would have thought the “mixed race” qualifier would have made it clear what is being asked, but I’ll be sure to spell it out for the undergrads tonight.

 Dizzy was an Anglican, of course, but even so, I don’t believe anyone sees religious belief as equivalent to melanin content in terms of class standing in “white” dominated Western democracies in the 19th and 20th centuries. 

 The color line was, after all, a slightly more intense barrier then which side of the Judeo-Christian dividing line one came down upon. After all, even the CSA made Benjamin a cabinet minister…

 Carroll in NZ is an interesting case; he was biracial, and elected by a pakeha constituency, but his PM service apparently was always as an interim/acting role; he was not – as far as I can tell – leader of his party/coalition.

Being of Jewish descent in 20th century Europe was quite a big deal.

(Dreyfus, etc.)

The current French president meets all three criteria. (Immigrant parentage, minority (polish) and mixed race.)

Yes, yes, but a little town in Oregon is clearly leading the way in political tolerance: Silverton elected the first transgender (man living as a woman) mayor on November 4th. I can’t imagine what those women who defected to McCain after Hillary lost will do if a man in a dress makes it to the White House before a woman does.
