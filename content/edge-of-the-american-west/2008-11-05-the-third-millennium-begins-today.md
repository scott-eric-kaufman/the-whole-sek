So said Eddie Izzard on the BBC’s election coverage.  We have [a holographic will.i.am](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deoOTqT-SMI)—they have [_Eddie Izzard_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEx5G-GOS1k).  American is still an imperfect nation.  Moreover, Warren Ellis [informs me](http://twitter.com/warrenellis/status/990721348) that Simon Schama lit into John Bolton on the BBC last night.  Reviews of Schama’s performance from footballer sites seem to confirm the majesty of the humiliation.  It went something like this:

Schama camps it up to annoy Bolton.

Schama rubs up Bolton a treat.

Bolton looks like Schama stole his wife and insulted his ‘stache.

Schama itches to give Bolton’s face a good pummeling to with his biro.

Schama talks to that Bolton twunt like he is a child. 

Schama leaned
 right into Bolton’s face like a drunken auntie coming on to a vicar.

Schama broke Bolton’s mind.

Bolton throws his toys fully out of the pram.

Schama and Bolton have disappeared.

Bolton’s probably bludgeoning Schama to death with his shoe in the toilets as we speak.

You can witness a bit of it about 3:32 into this clip:
