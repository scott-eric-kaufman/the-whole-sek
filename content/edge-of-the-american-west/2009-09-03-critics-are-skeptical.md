## “Critics are skeptical . . .”

Only they aren’t: they’re _critical_.

The word “skeptical” functions as a subject complement in this clause.  The particular complement here is a predicate adjective: the adjective “skeptical” describes an attribute of the subject “critics.”  But hidden beneath that grammatical nicety is an utter falsehood.

According to the _Oxford English Dictionary_, a “critic” is “one who pronounces judgment on any thing or person; _esp._ one who passes severe or unfavorable judgment; a censurer, fault-finder, caviller.”  Someone who is “skeptical,” however, is “inclined or imbued with [an] attitude of doubt or incredulity as to the truth of some assertion or supposed fact.”  Because a critic has already __ pronounced a severe or unfavorable judgment, he can no longer be considered an honest skeptic _because he has ceased doubting by acting upon truths not in evidence_.

Dishonest skeptics, then, would be those who act upon their doubts because there exists no fact powerful enough to compel them to shuck their skeptical posturing.  They are critics for whom skepticism is a convenient prop employed in the service of their criticism; and because they only doubt those truths uttered by those they criticize, their skepticism is not dispositive but tactical__.  They are not “disposed” to doubt so much as they doubt all statements of a political nature made by those they oppose irrespective of the truth or falsity of their claims.  So:

“Critics are skeptical of the President’s claim that it is raining.”

That won’t be heard because the content of the statement is apolitcal, so dishonest skeptics will accept it on its face.  However:

“Critics are skeptical of the President’s claim that it has rained more this year than last.”

This statement will compel dishonest skeptics to disbelieve its content, not because it is true or false, but because it could be implicated in a larger political discussion about global warming or the progress of stimulus-aided improvement to the capital grounds.  However, had that second statement been made by someone who is himself a dishonest skeptic, his fellows in skeptical dishonesty would concur because, even if it were implicated in a larger political discussion, it would be speaking on behalf of their agenda.

These dishonest skeptics are not skeptical: they are unabashedly and unashamedly critical.  By predicating an attribute to them that they do not actually possess, news organizations mask ideological rigidity behind a scrim of cautious deliberation.

All of which is only to say that if I don’t stop watching the news in the morning, these papers will never be graded, that cover letter will never be written, this writing sample will never be revised . . .

But if your job-title is ‘critic’, does that mean you’re not allowed to be skeptical about anything?

The ‘dishonest skeptics’ are not skeptical at all – there is no doubt, merely disinclination to agree, even over matters of observable fact.

Someone who is skeptical of the president’s claim that it is raining is someone who wants to see the president’s proofs, not necessarily someone who affirmatively believes that it is not raining.  It would be perfectly proper for a critic to be skeptical: “We ought not to go to war with Iraq over WMD, because the president hasn’t given us adequate proofs that Iraq even has WMD.”

I think the construction is Critics of X are skeptical of Y, in which case I don’t see a contradiction. The confusion is that X is often implied, rather than explicit. So “Critics [of the President] are skeptical of the President’s claim….” is fine.

@rea: That’s precisely the kind of honest skepticism that critics of a politician/political view generally do NOT display.  Once they see the proof, they’ll remain equally “skeptical”, but for vaguer and more specious reasons.

rea and Spike, Chris says what I would’ve: yes, critics can be skeptical; no, these critics aren’t skeptical, they merely pretend to be because they’re liars bound to a strict ideology.  They play at skepticism when encountering things contrary to that ideology, but they’re not actually skeptical.

You’ll note that I’m talking a rhetorical tic, and never associated it with either side of the aisle.  The post works like a mirror: you’re only implicated in it if you choose to stand before it.

“Scrim” stands out as one of the great “scr” words, like “screed” and “scrod.”
