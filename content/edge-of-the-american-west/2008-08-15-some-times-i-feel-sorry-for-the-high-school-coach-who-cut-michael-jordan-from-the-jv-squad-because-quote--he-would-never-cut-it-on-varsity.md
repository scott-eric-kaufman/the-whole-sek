## Some times I feel sorry for the high school coach who cut Michael Jordan from the JV squad because, quote, “He would never cut it on varsity.”

Others, I laugh at anonymous reviewers of such limited imagination their predictions have become Monuments of Wrongness.  [To wit](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9405EFD71331E033A25752C0A9679C94629ED7CF):

You’ve nailed my ideal (albeit not mutually exclusive) audience: monkeys, ladies, and idiots.  If only there were one of each on every hiring committee.

I think it was Galton who wandered the streets of the principal cities of the UK, surreptitiously recording a rating of the beauty of each woman he passed.  The city with the lowest average (IIRC) was Aberdeen.

But what were those ratings based on, Vance?  I ask, in all seriousness, because my Twain/Galton chapter turns on the appeal to obscene meticulousness of the sort typified by that snagged shot o’ review up there.  (I’d copy-and-paste the 
most awesomest
 soon-to-be definitive account of said literary OCD, but I ain’t on that computer no more.)

**ajay**

					

		

Ratings were based entirely on Galton’s personal opinion – on a scale of 1 to 5.

Right.  And at least as I recall it, he was scratching marks on a piece of paper in his pocket.  I don’t know whether Gould specified the _pants_ pocket….

Things are good here in the heart of the American West.  You should come visit some time.

Wait, you’re not on the East Coast any more?  Are you able to reveal the secret location of your bunker?  I can’t visit without knowing where you are.

_Wait, you’re not on the East Coast any more?_

That is correct.

_Are you able to reveal the secret location of your bunker?_

Yes.  It’s in a canyon in the central part of the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico.  Truly the heart of the American West.

Oh, I think I know that canyon well.  That’s a very good place to be, imho.
