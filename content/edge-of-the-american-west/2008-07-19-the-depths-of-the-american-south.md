As the [some of you caring for my cats](http://tonguebutnodoor.net/) already know, I’m off tomorrow to reacquaint myself with the depths of the American South.  (I _am_ a Future Mississippi Landowner, after all.)  Blogging may be light, as the internet is carried in buckets uphill both ways during violent thunderstorms down there, but I’ll do what I can.  In the meantime, feast on [my appreciation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/the-dark-knight.html) of _The Dark Knight_, or [Gerry’s](http://gerrycanavan.blogspot.com/2008/07/dark-knight.html), or the one [I’m compelling Adam](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2008/07/friday-afternoon-confessional-hella.html) to write via the Power of Link.

(And remember, kids, this ain’t [a substantial academic post](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/line-jumping-and-emotional-strategies/#comment-15312) on an academic blog so much as announcement of future unavailability of the sort common to academic listservs, so complain at your own risk.)

Is this the absence of a history post, or the absence of a historicist post?

Have a good break —
