I was wondering when we were going to get commentary on the Obama administration rather than what the next silly stunt the conservatives pulled.

I’ve yet to see _Idiocracy_, but it struck me the first time I read about it that it was a complete rip-off of C. M. Kornbluth’s famous [The Marching Morons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Marching\_Morons), one of the more anthologized sf stories ever (including in  _The Science Fiction Hall Of Fame_, Volume II.

_Idiocracy_ struck me as a great premise that was poorly realized. The script was so-so and the acting was on the terrible-ish side. I didn’t feel like I wasted my time watching it, unlike how I feel about the time I’ve spent listening to conservatives.

_Idiocracy_ was just too depressingly realistic a premise to get me to laugh much.

_I was wondering when we were going to get commentary on the Obama administration rather than what the next silly stunt the conservatives pulled._

I’ll post my commentary on the entirety of the Obama administration as soon as I’m done with all the silly stunts conservatives will pull for at least the next three years.

_it was a complete rip-off of C. M. Kornbluth’s famous The Marching Morons_

It can’t be complete, as there aren’t any intellectual titans working to correct the problem.  The time-traveler in the film awakes to find that, by default, he’s the smartest man in the world.  

_**Idiocracy** struck me as a great premise that was poorly realized. The script was so-so and the acting was on the terrible-ish side._

I was underwhelmed the first time I saw it, but like _Office Space_, the grace notes get funnier with repetition.  Also like _Office Space_, the second half of the film isn’t nearly as funny as the first, because Mike Judge seems to think that we care about how the story ends, when, in fact, his talent lies in finding the funny in endless iterations of the same.

_**Idiocracy** was just too depressingly realistic a premise to get me to laugh much._

I died a little inside when I realized that these hecklers of the POTUS were also from South Carolina, so I can sympathize.

There seems to be something about those South Carolina politicians.

[SPOILERS]

_It can’t be complete, as there aren’t any intellectual titans working to correct the problem._ 

Well, Kornbluth tried to even out the imbalance with massive population control measures for idiots — including death (under cover of colonization elsewhere) — but you could easily postulate an alternative in which the idiots revolt and wipe out the intellectuals, or in which the intellectuals decide to emigrate elsewhere, or the intellectuals form factions (could happen!) and kill themselves. 

Actually, given how much technology _did_ work in Idiocracy (something that bugged me no end at the time because it’s just not plausible), a future in which the intellectuals/technologists had survived in small numbers until fairly shortly before the time traveler arrives is quite reasonable.

Chris, \*of course\* we’d bombard their coasts and support slave revolts; after all, the Confederates would then be foreigners, and it’d be O.K. to do whatever we pleased to them.

_Idiocracy_ is an allegory if and only if y’all never been to a Bass Pro Shop.

As far as I’m concerned, the pretty clear point of “Marching Morons” is to dramatise the old eugenical nonsense about how “the smart superior people are breeding carefully and thus going extinct, and the stupid inferior people are having lots of welfare babies and will take over the gene pool.”  

Put that way, and maybe I’m missing some subtler level of parody, although given “The Black Bag” and \_Search the Sky\_ I don’t think so, you don’t have to be some semiotics guy from a university to see a subtext.  

(And for absolutely no reason whatsoever: [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels/6501-Stolen-Pixels-123-Her-Story](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels/6501-Stolen-Pixels-123-Her-Story))  

It seems to me that there is a strong case for whacking this theme over the head with a spade and burying it down some county road.
