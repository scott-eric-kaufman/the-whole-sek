A friend sent me the text of a recent _WSJ_ editorial entitled “Will This Crisis Produce a ‘Gatsby’?” I’ll link to it later—for now I want to recreate my bad-faith reading experience in all its glory.  My first reaction was to the title, even though I know authors never write their own titles.  But this one seemed sufficiently troublesome to warrant criticism.  I wrote:

You would think someone at the _WSJ_ would know that enough about literature to know that _The Great Gatsby_ was published in 1925.  If you grant the title its premises, the question should be “Did Someone Write a ‘Gatsby’ in 2004 and If So Who Was He or She and What Was the Title of It?” But that’s not quite right.

The _WSJ_‘s infuriating decision to publish the titles of books in quotation marks means that we’re not even sure whether the current crisis will be producing a novel affectionately called _Gatsby_ or a fictional Jew with class insecurities who meets an untimely end.  Because we have umpteen examples of the latter—_Curb Your Enthusiasm_ may even be a _Gatsby_-in-progress.  Tune in next season to find out!

But even that’s not quite right.  Given that _The Great Gatsby_ preceded the financial crisis by more than half a decade, maybe the author wants to claim that Fitzgerald’s slim volume _caused the Great Depression_.  In which case we must discover and burn all copies of the mysterious 2004 novel or unwrite the fictional Jew.  Obama said we all needed to chip in.  This is how we, as literary scholars, can do our part!

Then I started reading the text itself.  The mention of [Louis Adamic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis\_Adamic) seemed promising, and the rest of the article built what I took to be a fairly solid case until the last few paragraphs:

John Steinbeck’s novel “The Grapes of Wrath” made the Joad family’s flight from the dust bowl into an emblem of people coming together to remake their world. A similar image was implicit in the very title of Dorothea Lange and Paul Taylor’s documentary book “An American Exodus.” Even works of light entertainment like the massively popular “Gone With the Wind” or John Ford’s landmark Western “Stagecoach” were in keeping with the prevailing message of the times. All these works told of epic journeys in which a group of people overcame destructive competition in their discovery of a common destiny. Each called for Americans to act collectively to remake a democratic society where opportunity would be open to all.

In effect, such declarations helped lay the cultural groundwork for the New Deal, providing the ideological infrastructure for the new governmental institutions created during the ‘30s.

My response?

If there’s one thing I learned writing my dissertation, it’s that you can’t throw words like “ideology” around like that—_especially_ not when you’re claiming that a book published in 1939 laid the groundwork for the policies that were curtailed in 1939 by “[Dr. Win-the-War](http://books.google.com/books?id=BtSU6ZaCbzMC&pg=PA126&dq=%!d(MISSING)r.+new+deal%!&(MISSING)ei=6MGxSaKPBYOQlQSFje1Q&client=firefox-a#PPA126,M1).” If I’d tried to end-around history like that I would’ve—I don’t know what would’ve happened to me, actually, because I’d learned early in my graduate career to avoid situations in which I could be browbeaten by “[the fact, man, the irrefragable fact](http://books.google.com/books?id=G9lbz7CzwzoC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=%!i(MISSING)rrefragable+fact%!&(MISSING)source=bl&ots=WCBVZuwGR7&sig=TbZRkRcUGnS7yf1sbGQyUwaijqA&hl=en&ei=bcOxSaz-M4mGsQPm\_YmKAQ&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=1&ct=result)!”

I continued blustering on—scrolling back up the article, snipping the bits that confirmed my claim of sloppy historicism and snarking mightily upon them—until I returned to those final paragraphs and hit the byline:

**Sean McCann, a professor of English at Wesleyan University, is the author of “[A Pinnacle of Feeling: American Literature and Presidential Government](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691136955/diesekoschmar-20).”**

At first I thought [I’d been pranked](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/03/05/human-remains/).  Then I realized I’d done it to myself: I’d read the article about as uncharitably as it could be read.  I’d clipped the sections suggestive of causality . . . and ignored all those that spoke directly to the notion that the cultural output of the ‘30s _reflected_ a growing disenchantment with the vision of social mobility that’d been aggressively asserted in the ‘20s.  See [Sean’s article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123517583815437521.html) for all the details.

Me?  I’m off to go where they send half-cocked purveyors of online opinion when they misbehave: to _The Corner_.  (Dunce cap not optional.)

But a convert implied at various points right? Isn’t that one of Scott’s points? Or am I confounding authorship with content again?

this strikes me as a strange tale–sort of a morality tale about the perils of blind reading, or at any rate reading with blinders.

only, i can’t tell what the moral is.  you didn’t know who the author was, and in the absence of that knowledge, you read the piece uncharitably, and thought it was crap for a bunch of detailed reasons.

then you found out who the author was, and that changed your mind how exactly?  

i mean, should you now think \*better\* of the piece than you first did, solely because you know who the author is?  surely that would be a poor principle to use in, e.g. journal refereeing or hiring colleagues.

or do you think better of it now in virtue of having given it a second read with more charitable glasses on, but a second more charitable read that you gave it only because you know who the author is (and are inclined to be charitable to him)?  

which read is the more accurate one? does the author bear any responsibility for having made it so easy for you to read it uncharitably, i.e. did the author hide the caveats? 

or is the lesson that your first read was not blind in any case, since you knew about it something like “this was written by the sort of person who publishes in the wall street journal, and i already know what i think about \*that\* sort of person”?

but maybe you wanted to make other points entirely. i’m charitable, honestly, i just don’t know what you want me to give.

_I hereby add insult to injury: Jimmy Gatz was a fictional Lutheran._

If you want to play the “I can link to that post” game, well, [Gatz was black](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/crazy-crazy-tom-and-daisy/#comment-5186).  Ha!

Or, from the [most recent _Fitzgerald Review_](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/121454955/HTMLSTART):

we are not claiming that Gatsby is Jewish. That could not be proven, and even if it were, we would not want to make that claim. We are suggesting that perhaps Jay Gatsby, aka James Gatz or Katz, may have a dim Jewish background whose ethnicity has been eclipsed. The ethnicity of the gangsters who were prototypes for Gatsby—George Remus, Max Gerlach, and Arnold Rothstein—has not been determined (see Pauly; Bruccoli; Kruse). However, the Jewish identities of these gangsters was suggested when Fitzgerald wrote that his meeting with Rothstein was a “small focal point” from which he began to develop the character of Gatsby (Letters 551). With his gambling friend Jules (“Nicky”) Arnstein, Rothstein ran a scam with stolen Liberty Bonds. After Fitzgerald told Edmund Wilson “my plan for Gatsby,” Wilson portrayed him as a Jew, a gentleman bootlegger named Max Fleishman, in a monologue spoken by Simon Delacy in Wilson’s comedy, “The Crime in the Whistler Room” (Wilson 179-80; Mizener 171). At some point in the development of Gatsby, Fitzgerald seems to have muted his Jewish identity, just as—in cutting parts of “Absolution”—he had eliminated his Catholic identity. In both cases, the absence of a clear ethnic identity preserves the mystery of Gatsby’s origins.

I actually meant to email that article to eric.  I hope he reads this thread.

_But a convert implied at various points right? Isn’t that one of Scott’s points? Or am I confounding authorship with content again?_

Trust in me, drip.  I won’t let you down.  (Until I do.)  I don’t think it’s a settled issue—and now that I know a little more about the composition history, I don’t think it’s a settlable one.  The best we can do, I think, it play out the implications if he’s A, B or C as Michaels did in _Our America_.

_then you found out who the author was, and that changed your mind how exactly?_ 

Well, given that I know Sean’s work—he’s co-written pieces with my advisor—I recognized how uncharitably I’d read the piece.  When I went back and re-read it, I discovered how much the title—which I knew the author hadn’t written even before I knew who the author was—had skewed my reading.  

_or do you think better of it now in virtue of having given it a second read with more charitable glasses on, but a second more charitable read that you gave it only because you know who the author is (and are inclined to be charitable to him)?_

This is basically right—but it reflects poorly on me as a blind reader, _i.e._ someone who should be charitable until evidence that my charity will be abused.

“may have a dim Jewish background”

who you callin dim, fella?

“should be charitable until evidence that my charity will be abused.”

i don’t know. is that the general principle? it probably is not when you are trying to weed down 300 applicants to a final stack of 10. and maybe there’s another exception for anything published in the wsj.  (although any principle involving the wsj has to take account of the bizarre duality of that paper–sometimes brilliant reporting on the front page, uniformly moronic drivel on the editorial page).

Well, I think the surface textual evidence is pretty strong here. Gatz is from North Dakota. He went to a Lutheran college. His father, who seems like he hasn’t changed much from Gatz’s boyhood, gets a Lutheran minister to perform the funeral. He has a German name, which as John Emerson points out in [the other thread](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/crazy-crazy-tom-and-daisy/#comment-5237), in North Dakota is a lot more likely to belong to a German than a Jew. His name isn’t actually “Katz.” And the Jewish gangster Meyer Wolfsheim specifically recruits him as a more respectable front man, an “Oggsford,” so I don’t think there’s any evidence of a Jewish background there. 

And I actually found saw a bit of that piece in the _Fitzgerald Review_, but this sentence: 

_At some point in the development of Gatsby, Fitzgerald seems to have muted his Jewish identity, just as—in cutting parts of “Absolution”—he had eliminated his Catholic identity._

seems to amount to, “In one early draft Fitzgerald portrays Gatsby as Jewish, in another early draft he portrays him as Catholic, but by the time of the published version he’d deleted all that stuff.” (Except it sounds like it was Wilson who thought Gatsby was Jewish.) And what he left in was a fair amount of stuff that suggests that Gatz was brought up Lutheran. 

Postulating a dim Jewish background just doesn’t seem necessary — the small-town North Dakota poor-boy background is enough for Gatz to want to remake himself. I have sympathy with the idea that the issue isn’t settlable, and I think it’s worthwhile to think about the question of “What if Gatz was Jewish?” — but the weight of evidence that Gatz had a Lutheran background, and the absence of evidence that he had a Jewish one, seems to me to make “Gatz was Jewish!” into a possibly interesting reimagining rather than an interpretation.

The ‘Is Gatsby Jewish-Catholic-Lutheran’ question is a variation on Eric’s ‘Is Daisy black?’ question, both of which depend on the fact that FSF posited his characters as essentially ambiguous frauds.  The tension in the work that Tom Daisy and Nick display are over the fact that they each know or suspect that they aren’t who they think they are portraying themselves to be; what variety of that fraudulence each of them actually exhibits is beside the point; the fact of the question arizing variously in each of them creates the tension.

More pertinently, to this thread, is the issue of  what truly is a proper reading, charitable-correctly-to-the-extent that one should invest charity.  That SEK recognized a biased reading on his part, or more particularly, that he could _choose_ how much room to give the author – only after that author was identified –  is at the least a partial success.  After all, as the man said, success is only the result of previous failures, without which there would not have been any engagement in the first place.  No blame for considering the source (as KB said the WSJ’s bizarre duality)and responding probably appropriately before revisiting the filters one has applied to see if the first presumption wasto sheltered.

The point about all those works from the late 30s “laying the groundwork” for the New Deal is sound no matter who the author, isn’t it?
