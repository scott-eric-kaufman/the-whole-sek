## Copyrighting dissertations?

So I’m performing all the piddly tasks attendant to filing while I wait for word of signatures when I come across [this](http://www.lib.uci.edu/libraries/collections/special/uci\_td/td4.html):

You may choose to copyright your manuscript by including the copyright notice but not formally registering your copyright. However, to fully protect your rights in a copyright dispute and to be eligible for damages caused by infringement, you must register your copyright. You can register your copyright at any time within its term.

If you are submitting a Ph.D. dissertation, you may have the copyright registered for you by UMI Dissertation Services (a division of ProQuest Information and Learning Company). To do this, submit the UMI form and required fee (certified check or money order—UMI does not accept personal checks) to the University Archives when you submit your manuscript. UMI will register your copyright and submit your manuscript to the Library of Congress.

I’m no copyright lawyer—nor do I understand commonplace copyright law all that well—but it seems excessive to have to pay someone else a fee to secure the rights to my own dissertation.  I’m inclined to slap a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/about/license/) requiring attribution, noncommmerical use, no derivatives and share alike and not pay anyone anything.

I’m not about to Doctorow the thing—no one’s likely to translate my dissertation into Romanian—but I’m fairly certain free copyright protection is better than expensive copyright protection.  Were I in the sciences and my research might one day mint some pharmaceutical company a forture I could see doing it.  But in the humanities?  Is it really necessary?  In other words:

Is my Jew showing or am I just being practical?

_Is my Jew showing or am I just being practical?_

Very Carrie Bradshaw.  

About the issue at hand:  I don’t know.  I paid for the copyright, though I’m not sure why.  I think probably because better safe than sorry, right?  Anyway, I’m sure someone will come along with a horror story:  “He finished his dissertation and got an okay job.  Then, about six months later, he went to the movies.  Word for word, the dialog in the film followed his dis.  The movie’s name?  _Star Wars_.  He never saw a penny in royalties.”  Even though I just made that up, I think better safe than sorry is the way to go.  George Lucas is always prowling the stacks looking for new ideas.

You don’t have to \*do\* anything to copyright your dissertation or any other public document you create, although a Creative Commons license has the benefit of making it clear what people can and cannot do with your work. But see this link ([http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html](http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html)) for more information on copyright.

The question is whether UMI is charging a fee for the registration of the copyright, or whether registering the copyright itself costs.  If the former, you can get the full copyright protection without paying UMI.

[There seems to be a filing fee of $35](http://www.copyright.gov/register/).  What’s UMI’s fee?

_Star Wars_ was based on [previous copyrighted works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Hidden\_Fortress), but since people are starting to write dissertations about it, what goes around comes around.

ari, 

Hate to break it to you, but not even Lucas would [stoop to the depths I cite](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/xposted\_from\_th.html). 

ben,

I don’t know how much UMI’s asking for, but as it’s more than I have whatever it is, I’m inclined to seek alternative options.

Kim, 

I think we’re on the same wavelength, inasmuch as UMI seems to be operating in (and profiting from) a pre-easy-CC mindset.

As I understand it, you don’t have to do anything to have copyright. Just publishing anything with your name on it means its yours. Whatever you do after that is just to make sure that there is a public record documenting the facts of your copyright.

**Mock Hare**

					

		

Well, I am a copyright lawyer, and if you want to maximize your recovery in a future copyright infringement suit, you should absolutely register the dissertation.  So, to the extent you’re worried about a rogue, I dunno, university press or something taking your dissertation and commercializing it without your permission, you should go ahead and pay the $35.  If the university is charging more, you can register it yourself at eco.copyright.gov.

If you’re less worried about rogue university presses, you can keep in mind the fact that you can always register later and still sue, you’ll just (probably) get less money.

Much to my (geek cred) shame, I haven’t seen any after _Episode I_.  (Does it even deserve italics?  I think not.)

I say this as someone whose favorite moment in film history — [_Forever?  **Forever** ever?_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy6Qbu029Zc) — is when Luke “asks” Jabba if he’s really sure this is a good idea and the Hut rocks his qasbah all literally like . . . at least, that’s what it was when I was obsessed with . . . what are you talking about again, you stupid and ignorant person with no knowledge and whose stupid ignorance of I don’t know _whatever_ won’t reflect poorly on my awesomeness as a candidate . . . maybe I shouldn’t respond right now.

Mock Hare, can I cite you by that in a court of law?  

More seriously though, I fully anticipate on fully shaming anyone who tries to steal my work for their own gain.  I own Google searches on my topics, and I’ve already swatted a few contenders into submission via (what I take must be) the weak protections of CC licensing.  That said, Larry Lessig does appear (and, in his own molestation trials, strongly appears) to be on the right side of the law.  

I guess another way of saying this is, given that I’m comfortable with the protection CC offers me, should I fork over money to UMI or not?

Actually, were you in the sciences, the university would probably own the rights to the results of your university-sponsored research. A lot of places make incoming students sign patent agreements. [Example](http://www.stanford.edu/dept/DoR/rph/su18.html).

**[Sybil Vane](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/)**

					

		

I couldn’t figure out what to do about myself. Ultimately, I decided that my files and emails and various revisions, interactions with committee, etc., constituted ample evidence that my dissertation is mine, and that it was written within a certain date range. So should I see parts of it reproduced somewhere else, plagiarism would be very easy to prove. I don’t know if this necesarily leads into recouping monetary damages, but I also decided academic books never make any money. So.

**Prof Burgos**

					

		

Echoing Mock Hare, my attorney advised me that there’s no such thing as too much protection, because even if you have “plenty” of evidence that the work is yours, demonstrating infringement — outside of the domain of the academy (i.e., in a book review where you write, “Professor Schmedlap was clearly influenced by my pioneering work on Late Early Medieval Manga — though curiously Schmedlap doesn’t cite it…”) — is an uphill battle.  

So if the shame is sufficient, because — as Sybil Vane points out — academic books don’t make money, then you’re good-to-go.  But if your work were stolen and put, for example, in a popular history — the kind that does make money (cf, Ambrose and Kearns-Goodwin) — then maybe the shame wouldn’t be sufficient.

All that being said, you can DIY a copyright registration with the Copyright office, but you’ll pay the same money and have to do extra work — so it will cost you more in the end.

**Prof Burgos**

					

		

After posting, and I apologize here for doubling-down, a thought occurred to me in re: shame.

My diss. adviser advised me not to ask questions of a particular scholar in our field — even though said scholar’s work was relevant to mine, and even though I cited Said — because Said was notorious (apparently) for stealing graduate students’ ideas.

This was known/suspected throughout the kingdom but had not materially affected Said’s career progression, because the presumption was that Said was more likely to come up with Idea X than was Grad Student because Said was Said and who the fark was Grad Student?  

This was especially the case because, if the idea was a nifty one, Said could get it into print — or at least out there at a conference — far more readily than Grad Student could.  The editors at Said’s journal-of-choice were always happy to hear from Said, and Said routinely appeared on those non-panel panels at the American Association of The Field annual meetings.

So in the strategic shame interaction there, the advantages were all in Said’s court.

yeah, i’m w/ those who advise forking over the 35 bucks. your inner jew can show in many ways: think of this as a very cheap investment that might pay off in several ways. it’s a bah-gan! you’re getting it wholesale!

unlike my discipline, yours produces books that sometimes sell real volume and make real money. you could actually see royalty checks on this diss (or more likely a revision of it that emphasizes narrative, conflict, sex, and car-crashes).

and even failing that, you don’t want to see kearns-goodwin or prof. sogennant making a pile off your work–or even burnishing their reputations off it.

I put a copyright notice in my thesis, and was told by our library that they wouldn’t accept a thesis with a copyright notice unless it was registered by UMI. I said I didn’t think this was needed, given that creative works were “born copyrighted”–and eventually was backed up by the University Counsel–for University of California, Systemwide, so I assume they knew what they were talking about.

I’ve actually been told, by a representative of a respectable university press, the exact opposite.  The more people who read a bit of a book online, the larger the potential audience.  It’s why I get 20 some-odd books a week from university publishers begging for a book event.

**Robert Halford**

					

		

I’m not a copyright lawyer, or not really one.  But I know enough to tell you, like a lot of people above, that you should register the copyright.  You certainly do have a copyright interest in the work without registration, but it’s far less valuable.  You can’t sue for infringement until you register (you can register after you discover an infringement, but that can take months and can be very frustrating in context, since it limits your ability to use the copyright as a threat by seeking an injunction).

Most important, without registration, your available damages are substantially more limited — in that you can’t collect “statutory” damages and attorneys fees.  In the case of a low-financial-value academic publication, registration is particularly important.  That’s true because with a registered copyright you can collect statutory damages even from someone who is NOT making a profit from your work.  So your ability to threaten a harmful but not financially successful infringer (e.g., the rogue university press above) is much greater with registration than without.

By the way, nothing’s stopping you from both registering the copyright and getting a CC license, if you want to.  The CC license is just a license (or, actually, a range of different licenses) that you grant to the world to use your work.  But the CC license can’t give you the benefits of registration.  No reason to not enjoy the benefits of registration and then also get the CC license.

_I guess another way of saying this is, given that I’m comfortable with the protection CC offers me, should I fork over money to UMI or not?_

The protection comes from having a copyright in the work itself, which comes from actually writing it.  A CC license doesn’t actually offer the author any additional legal protection.  It’s just a way of letting _other people_ use the work without fear of an infringement lawsuit, so long as they abide by the terms of the license. 

There differences in “protection” between registered/unregistered works come down to damages in a lawsuit, but it doesn’t change whether people are entitled to steal from your work. If you wanted, you could register and use a CC license.

Hello,

I seem to recall that a friend recently found that her thesis had shown up published by some online service, without her knowing anything about it.  A friend just wrote to her about it.  It wasn’t that she was concerned about the publication itself — I believe the topic was something arcane like 18th Century Italian literature –, so much as the fact that someone could just grab her work and disseminate it (I believe for a “service” fee).

I would think that simply slapping on a (c) notice would be sufficient to give you any control you needed over that kind of behavior … if that was significant.

Thanks.

Here’s the poop on UMI, if you give them the money you are also giving them distribution and reselling rights for your dissertation.  They will sell your dissertation and pay you a 10%!r(MISSING)oyalty.  

Here’s their agreement [http://www.gradschool.umd.edu/gss/forms/masters\_thesis\_publishing\_agreement.pdf](http://www.gradschool.umd.edu/gss/forms/masters\_thesis\_publishing\_agreement.pdf)

They offer an Open Access option for which you would pay them an additional $95!  Then instead of selling your thesis, they make it available for free in their database. (although the dissertation will be free the database is not.  Libraries pay a fee for the database.) See pages 8 and 18 of the linked file.

Not sure there’s a real benefit here.  In the olden days it was useful to have your thesis in UMI’s dissertation abstracts b/c that was where people looked for that kind of thing.  Very different today.
