In a post on _American Daily Review_, Tony Magana urges embittered conservatives to buck up and [use the Force](http://www.americandailyreview.com/home-features-articles-blog/2009/5/4/what-star-wars-teaches-conservatives.html):

I am reminded of the classic battle in the movie “Star Wars” where the small force of the Rebel Alliance is attacking the much larger and stronger fleet of the Empire. They know that to win there is only one strategy, they must focus their attack on a specific area of vulnerability on the otherwise impenetrable Death Star. In the end, victory was achieved by “_**staying on target**_.”

My advice to the Republican party is simple, believe in the “force” (your conservative principles). Identify the “target” (the economy and the war). Win by “_**staying on target**_.”

I agree.  Republicans _will_ win if they “stay on target”:


Did I say Republicans?  I meant to say “America.”
