In a post on _American Daily Review_, Tony Magana urges embittered conservatives to buck up and [use the Force](http://www.americandailyreview.com/home-features-articles-blog/2009/5/4/what-star-wars-teaches-conservatives.html):

I am reminded of the classic battle in the movie “Star Wars” where the small force of the Rebel Alliance is attacking the much larger and stronger fleet of the Empire. They know that to win there is only one strategy, they must focus their attack on a specific area of vulnerability on the otherwise impenetrable Death Star. In the end, victory was achieved by “_**staying on target**_.”

My advice to the Republican party is simple, believe in the “force” (your conservative principles). Identify the “target” (the economy and the war). Win by “_**staying on target**_.”

I agree.  Republicans _will_ win if they “stay on target”:


Did I say Republicans?  I meant to say “America.”

the stuka did. some other wwii two-seaters did. (even aside from the b-25, b-29, etc. which had tail-gunners.)

why contemporary fighters do not have rear-facing armaments is a puzzle to me, i agree.  i saw an imax film about f-16s and other modern jets dog-fighting, and the main tactic was still to get behind the other guy. 

huh? eighty years later and we still can only shoot at people in front of us? nobody has figured out how to fire something behind them?

**[Ahistoricality](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com)**

					

		

I knew about bomber tail gunners — the “flying fortress” model of planes too big to be really maneuverable, but capable of hauling all kinds of armaments and payload — but not the stuka and other fighters. Why would they give that up?

Heck, you wouldn’t even have to modify the planes: just have a “loop around” option on air-to-air missiles. (yes, I know it’s a complex programming problem, but not an order of magnitude different from what they already do, given the friend-or-foe ID systems already in place)

Or some rear-firing missile (put a drogue chute on it, with a delay before the missile fires). 

Even if it were limited, it could be a nice thing to use when the other guy has got you and is about to shoot something up your tailpipe.  He’d have a choice between breaking position, or risking being hit.

**[dana](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com)**

					

		

I am not an expert, but I think that part of the problem is that the rear gun either requires a gunner, or a sophisticated enough software system that can avoid shooting the plane itself by mistake (“I’m sorry son.  They got us.”), and that the big sacrifice is maneuverability (which the fighters might reasonably want privileged.)

**Erik Lund**

					

		

Most air combats (80%!i(MISSING)s the number that sticks to mind) are ambushes. When the energetically advantaged plane detects first, it converts energy into positional advantage. The position behind the detected target is both the easiest to reach and the easiest shot –and this applies to missiles just as much as fighters.  

When a disadvantaged aircraft detects first, that disadvantage remains dangerous. The best defence is to counter the opponents’ energetic advantage by whatever means of maximising velocity/altitude change are available.  

The higher the engine power, the lower the drag, the higher the rate of climb, the better the fighter. There is very little room here for a back seater. Now, an interceptor assumed to have a privileged position over any possible target is a very different matter, which is why carrier fighters tend to be two-seaters, and why I am now prepared to argue about Fairey fighters and why Correlli Barnett is a stupid-head.  

Anyone? C’mon, it’s got Thatcher in it!

**ajay**

					

		

Why no rear guns on fighters?  

Used to be: because of unacceptable weight penalties. Ditch the gun, the turret and the gunner, and you’ll have enough speed that you’ll be able to get behind the other guy instead. (Boulton Paul Defiant. Not A Good Fighter.)  

Now: who uses guns? Combat takes place at missile ranges – ten, twenty, thirty miles or more. If there’s an enemy right behind you at gun range, you don’t want to hang around lining up a shot from your rear gun, because you have about half a second left to live, so you want to break hard. 

What about rear-firing missiles?  

The first thing a missile fired directly to the rear is going to hit is the exhaust and turbulence immediately behind you. This isn’t good for them. 

What about ones that loop around?  

Air to air missiles come in two classes. Short-range ones are IR homing; they pick up the heat of an exhaust. Long range ones are radar homing, using either the fighter’s radar, their own radar or both.  

Now, IR homers are obviously fire-and-forget; but they have to pick up the target first. You have to point them at it. And they’re carried pointing forwards, because that’s the way they’re launched. So you need to point your aircraft at the target, tell the missile “there it is, go get him” and then launch.  

Radar homers – you need to “lock” your radar onto the target, and your radar’s in the nose of your aircraft. So the same applies.

thinking out of the box for a moment, it seems to me that birds are deadly weapons against plains. So I imagine some clever contraption containing birds that could be set free, then hanging confused in the air and hit(be hit by) the plane behind you. Being more of a political/ideas kind of historian myself(and danish and first time commenter, sorry for the missspullongs and bad grammars), I’m not really qualified to decide if it would be better use one really big goose or several lighter sparrows?

**[Ahistoricality](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com)**

					

		

Sorry, Erik and ajay, I’m not buying it. Existing imaging and analysis technology should allow us to get by most of those hurdles: you’re assuming that the limitations are inherent in the systems; I think they’re incidental and correctable. 

Take the “need” for a gunner on a rear-facing gun. I just got a ride in a friend’s SUV and there was a cute little monitor on the dash showing what was behind the beast. The gun doesn’t need to be aimed any more than the front guns do: it’s fixed, and the pilot handles targeting by moving the plane. Does it add some complexity, some equipment, some difficulty? Yes. Is it inconcievable and impracticable? Not even close.

A single goose, definitely. Engines are designed to deal with birdstrikes up to about large chicken size or so. Anything above that would be effective: an ostrich would probably be the ideal. Of course, ostriches can’t fly, so you’d need to give them hang gliders.

**dave**

					

		

Rear guns on modern fighter-jets? Unless they were autocontrolled there’s no way the pilot would have time to do that.

The sparrows thing? Ha-ha, very funny, but of course planes do release chaff and flares, for slightly different reasons.

One big thing about forward pointing weapons – there’s a reason they call those guys ‘fighter jocks’. It’s all about being the one doing the catching-and-killing. Nobody wants to have stuff pointing backwards on his ‘plane: “What? You mean I might be the one in trouble, no sir not me…”

[Of course, some of the fighter jocks are female now, but it’s the esprit de corps….]

**kid bitzer**

					

		

thanks, dave. the reference to esprit de corps and macho mystique of invincibility also explains why fighter jets do not contain harnesses or ejection seats.

look: what’s the objection to some form of insurance against ambush?  sure, we all like to think that we will be the ambushers, not the ambushees, but even fighter jocks know that the tables can be turned. that’s why the train red team/blue team stuff. you’re telling me that after you have suffered ambush and shoot-down from the rear several times in training, you are going to decline to have rear-attack capabilities because it hurts your ego?  you clearly think a lot worse of these guys than i do.

i’m with ahistoricality: the challenges to having missiles or other ordinance that can address planes behind you are a matter of engineering, and fairly feasible ones at that. 

though–the very fact that the engineering seems highly do-able lends support to dave’s suggestion that the real barriers are cultural/psychological.

didn’t the russkies work on an air-to-air missile that had optical targetting and thrust-vectoring for making u-turns? i’ll see what i can find.

Thare are all sorts of practical reasons why rear-facing guns on fighters didn’t/don’t work. Erik and ajay outlined most of them.

It was tried pretty seriously in the run up to WWII and the planes that had them (someone’s already mentioned the Boulton Paul Defiant) got absolutely slaughtered during the war.

And ambushes that put the enemy fighter _right_ on someone’s tail don’t happen that much anymore because of radar.  Heck, even bombers don’t have rear-facing guns anymore.

**kid bitzer**

					

		

people citing the defiant–does it not seem relevant to you that it had \*no forward facing guns\*? 

i mean: is that really a fair and relevant test of the question at hand?

some of us are asking whether, in addition to the full array of forward-facing missiles etc., it would be advantageous to add rear-facing ones. 

and as a refutation of this, you cite a plane that had \*no\* forward facing armaments, and could not swivel its rear-facing gun so as to bring it to bear on the forward line of flight.

okay, i’ll back off. amazing how a brief acquaintance with wwii specs i know nothing about is threatening to erupt into full-on nerd-fury. i’m outraged! what about schräge musik? i challenge you to serial numbers at ten paces!

 _people citing the defiant–does it not seem relevant to you that it had \*no forward facing guns\*?_ 

Sure.  So I’ll add in the German Bf-110, which had both rear and forward facing guns and got slaughtered in the Battle of Britain.  The issue in WWII was that putting another person in the plane so compromised maneuverability that it became vulnerable to single-seaters.

Are there \_successful\_ examples you’d like to point out? (the P-61 Black Widow had rear-facing guns, I think, but it was designed as a night-fighter)

You could do an automatic cannon in a current plane (in fact the B-52 bomber used to have a remotely controlled rear-facing gun, but they were taken out in the 1970s and 80s, if I recall correctly), but there would still be a weight penalty, and in the time it would take a fighter pilot to line up a shot with their LCD screen, the plane behind them would have fired a IR missile up their tail-pipe and be back in the hangar having a nice cup of tea.

Creating a missile that could be fired at a rear-target \_is\_ actually a major engineering issue and one that hasn’t been conquered yet.  The AIM-9X Sidewinder is the latest generation of a missile that’s been in development since the 1950s and is the most successful air-to-air missile in history and it can lock on targets as much as 90 degrees off the front.  Getting to 180 degrees hasn’t happened yet.

Loading the missiles so they point rearwards (and rejiggering the plane radar so that it could target rearward) would create a substantial aerodynamic drag on the plane.

Finally, air forces have essentially tried to counter the issue by using tactics.  Fighters don’t fly by themselves, but in flights of two or three (depending on the air force).  The flights cover each other’s rear vulnerabilities (cf. [the Thach Weave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thach\_Weave), for example).

 _Oh, well, OK, then. No reason to think anything’s changed_ 

What \_has\_ changed (since Vietnam at least) is that the United States has not lost a single fighter in air-to-air combat.

In how many wars since Vietnam has the United States faced an enemy capable of putting fighters in the air?  (As opposed to guys with SAMs on the ground, which I’m pretty sure we \*have\* lost aircraft to.)  About 15 minutes of the first Gulf War?

Anyway, what I would imagine is something like a giant shotgun, fixed to the rear.  If someone is directly behind you, push the button along with whatever you’re doing to disrupt their shot at you.  No aiming – it’s an area denial weapon whose area is “right behind me”.  No reloading – you probably won’t need to fire it once on most missions, let alone twice, so let the ground crew reload it.  Heck, you probably don’t even need a barrel – something like a Claymore mine hooked up to a trigger in the cockpit could do the job.  Your exhaust and turbulence are not a problem because it’s just unaimed chunks of metal intended to be crashed into by the oncoming enemy.

However, I don’t know  

(a) what size chunks of metal you need to scatter behind you to seriously inconvenience the enemy;  

(b) how many of those chunks you need to cover a useful volume of space; and  

(c) how many air combats involve sufficiently close pursuit in the first place.

But I think comparing it to \*aimed\* rear fire including a tailgunner is going a little overboard.

_In how many wars since Vietnam has the United States faced an enemy capable of putting fighters in the air?_

Fine.  I’ll add the Israelis in, then.  They \*have\* fought a number of wars since WWII which included substantial air combat and the number they have lost to enemy fighters is extremely low.

_No aiming – it’s an area denial weapon whose area is “right behind me”_

‘right behind me’ in aerial combat is well outside the range of a shotgun, even a large one.

Looking at the world war…  

i) “The Defiant had no forward guns” is a red herring, probably out of Hawker-Siddeley, whose rival type could take a wing gun. Boulton Paul answered that by pointing out that 1 gun was hardly sufficient under modern conditions, hence the 4-gun turret, and the “Wolverhampton Dreadnought,” which would have had a 4xHispano 20mm turret(400lbs of rotary weight for the guns alone!)  

Since the Defiant’s turret was 360, with a neat selective interruptor, the Boulton Paul plane had forward armament when needed. (Caveat: the splatbook I’m citing only \_specifies\_ this for the Defiant II, so I might be wrong about the type that fought the Battle of Britain, though I cannot imagine why I would be.)  

It has been suggested that most Defiant losses in the Battle may have been a result of blowing overstressed main fuses/being out of ammo than through tactical inadequacies.  

ii) The Defiant has been usefully described as an attempt to expand the intercept envelope by improving on the weapon system rather than ‘plane performance. It was intended for killing bombers/recon types rather than fighters, and has this in common with night fighters and many carrier fighters.  

iii) That said, I would be interested in tracking down the evolution of the design and seeing if the Bristol Fighter was an influence. Certainly the Defiant was undergoing proving as an army cooperation type when the war broke out. But the key issue here would be radio and the perceived need for a dedicated operator, a rapidly changing situation.  

iv) Remote control rear-facing weapons brought old-timey engineers right to the bleeding edge of contemporary automated control technology. The Me210, Vickers Windsor and perhaps the Lincoln had experimental installations, but there was nothing earlier that I can think of. This is a much understudied subject, considering how important these “computer” things have turned out to be, although there was a good book out of MIT a few years back. I’m ashamed to admit that I’m drawing a blank on the author’s name, though. Need more coffee.  

v) The many twin-engined fighters of the war raise separate issues. In general the designers were trying to pack in so much engine power that they could have their cake and eat it, too. This is how the P-61 Black Widow ended up with a wing span comparable to a 1939 medium bomber, and a moment of inertia to match.

It might also be worth considering when the last time was that guns were important in air to air combat. Dogfights happen at longer ranges now, people. In 1940, you engaged targets at less than 200 yards range. That doesn’t happen any more. It’s miles, not yards. I am going to keep saying this because people still seem to think that big shotguns, rear turrets, Claymore mines etc are realistic weapons for use in modern air combat.

part of my puzzlement about modern fighter tactics comes from watching “fighter pilot: operation red flag”:

[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353168/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353168/)

which is on the imax at the national air & space museum.

shot in 2004, it is a smugly triumphalist infotainment commercial for lockheed and the other jet makers.  it is also supposed to document a week spent at a training-session out at nellis in nevada where pilots train in staged combat, scored by computers.

these guys spend a \*ton\* of time still obsessing over getting behind their opponent, not letting their opponent get behind them, etc. that seems to be the main tactical question. are you on someone’s tail, or is someone on your tail?

i’m not disagreeing with what you say, ajay–it should all be a game of ten to twenty miles away, guns don’t matter, etc.

and yet, if you watch this movie, you would think you were still seeing tactics based on the technology available in wwi.  they actually line the damned plane up with their target before the shoot, which strikes me as utterly moronic.  (not moronic for a warthog, of course, since its line of fire is coaxial. but moronic for anything firing rockets, i’d have thought.)

so if someone wants to tell me that this movie grossly misrepresents modern fighter tactics, despite being made in 2004, i’ll be happy to hear it.

Errr….this precisely recapitulates the USAF’s fighter doctrine of the Vietnam era, which held that a) missiles are everything, b) beyond-visual-range radar-guided missiles are better, and c) our superior technology will prevail. Hence the main point was to be the first to the battle, to identify the enemy on radar, and launch medium-range (Sparrow) missiles, then stand well back while the enemy tried to evade them and you tried to evade the enemy’s.

Unfortunately the North Vietnamese air force in their MiGs, and their Soviet advisors, took a different view; they held that a) the Americans have really good rockets and so b) we better do something else, which was to endeavour to avoid step 2 above, or failing that, to launch their medium-range missiles first in order to start your fighters evading (and pointing their eyes and radars in the other direction) and then to bore in on your fighters at maximum speed and “merge”, as they say in the trade, which means to convert the battle into a dogfight.

This worked embarrassingly well, with the result that the USAF and USN did a major rethink of their tactics, technology, training, and aircraft, which concluded that you better be good at the difficult stuff, however great your widgets are.

Some would say that over-reliance on Our Superior Technology is a lasting American trait.

How exactly do you explain the process that led to guns being built into later versions of the F-4 then?

Alex&gt; The point about overestimating technology is valid, but I have a suspicion that improvements in missile technology (particularly the Russian’s work on off-boresight IR sensors) since Vietnam have far outpaced the improvements in maneouverability of fighter planes and counter-measures. Jamming radar is one thing, but stopping a jet engine being a very concentrated source of infrared emissions? There’s really only so much you can do…

Vietnam was, after all, 40 years back now, when the transistor was still the bleeding edge of technology.

**[Alex](http://yorksranter.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

Yes; but IR missiles that do head-on intercept have been around for a while as well without radically changing tactics. The first UK one was Red Top, and that’s 40 years back now. And head-on intercept was the ideal option in 1940, too, but the obvious counter to it is to break like hell, at which point it’s a turning fight. Again.

Further, a jet engine being a concentrated source of IR \*means\* that getting on the other guy’s tail is always going to be important. Also, [it’s not as if they don’t do BVR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-120).

This is all a bit hypothetical though – I’m trying to think of the last time when two reasonably sophisticated air forces met on any degree of parity? 73? The unit cost of manned airplanes is such these days that if your BVR missiles fall flat, the need to preserve your force is such that hitting the deck and pissing off back to base ASAP would seem the most appropriate response. Bit tough on anybody on the ground, but air forces have never shown much concern for them.

(I’m trying to remember how the air war in the Iran-Iraq war panned out – IIRC, the Iranian F14 fleet was never completely immobilised, but took a rather parsimonious approach to flying hours to eke out whatever spare parts they had left. The Israelis did sell them tank engines for their M-48s, though…)
