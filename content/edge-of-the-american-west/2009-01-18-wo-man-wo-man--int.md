Look at this screen-shot of the _OED_ today and tell me if you see him:

![animal1](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/animal1.jpg?w=490 "animal1")

No?  Let me blow him up for you:

![animal2](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/animal2.jpg?w=490 "animal2")For reference:

![animalreference](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/animalreference.jpg?w=490 "animalreference")

Why is he Kilroying around the _OED_?  I don’t know, but to be safe, we should keep close watch on certain [choice](http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50070265?query\_type=word&queryword=drum&first=1&max\_to\_show=10&sort\_type=alpha&result\_place=1&search\_id=XRp8-uriwym-7134&hilite=50070265) [entries](http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50056738?).

i don’t get it.

“Why is he Kilorying”

do you mean “kilroying”, as in “kilroy was here”?

and when i go to the oed page, i don’t find any picture of animal there.

i mean, i like the whole concept–it would be nice if animal did pop up in the oed, and nice if the oed welcomed animal–but i feel like i’m not understanding what you are attempting.

Yes, that’s loosely what I mean by Kilroying—menacingly peering at you over a wall, making Hitler cry, &c.  And you’re not seeing that?  It’s where the “next entry” button should be when you pull up a definition.  I’m still seeing over here.  Maybe it’s some weird campus service glitch.  But _maybe_, just _maybe_, they’re making room for Animal.

nope. not via my subscription.

and note that you’ve got a typo, “kilory”, which is why i asked.

i think maybe someone at your campus is having fun??

Typo fixed.  There’s something about words you know will earn red squiggles from Firefox that makes you ignore them when you edit.  Stupid, um, me.

As for someone having a laugh, I suppose that could be the case, but it’s an odd thing for a kid that age to do.  I’m guessing it’s the top or bottom half of some icon that, for whatever reason, is popping up instead of the “next entry” tab.  But I prefer my explain.

That’s the top bit of the NoScript logo.  NoScript is a Firefox add-on that blocks execution of scripts (javascript, Java, flash, etc).  What it means is that the oed website is asking your computer to run some sort of script to implement a button or something.  If you click in the header and scroll down, you’ll see urls for the blocked widgets.  Or if you look in the lower right-hand corner of your firefox window, you’ll see a blue S in a ‘No’ sign – click on that and select ‘Temporarily allow oed.com’ and things will work as you expect.

Scott, I’m hurt that you’re ignoring my email.

rmb, I do have NoScript installed, and now that I look at it, you’re absolutely right.  I’m not sure why it was blocking one little button, but it’s screwy like that sometimes.  ([For reference](http://z.about.com/d/browsers/1/G/w/8/-/-/noscript.png), except when it blocks something, there’s no “No” there, just the scriptmonster.)

ben, I usually don’t check my email on weekends.  (Endless student requests are a weekday job.)  I’ll check it just for you, though.

So…. this is something you installed on a Firefox extension and then forgot about?

No, no, I’m not laughing at you.  I’m laughing _near_ you.

i myself would be happy to install a firefox extension that caused muppets to glare at me from odd corners of the screen.

esp. animal.

the dissemination of such an add-on would fit in well with this blog’s mission, i’d think.

I didn’t forget about it, dana, it just normally looks like [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/noscript.jpg).  As soon as rmb pointed out what it was, I felt stupid, but you normally don’t see the scriptmonster peeking its eyes above a bar on the _OED_.  I mean, I’ve consulted the _OED_ twenty times a day for the past eight years and never before has NoScript blocked any of it, much less a little “next entry” button.

Plus, it _does_ look like Animal, and what with this blog’s mission and all . . .
