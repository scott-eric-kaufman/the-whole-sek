## “Professor Strunk was a positive man. His book contains rules of grammar phrased as direct orders.”

On this day in 1959 as [you may already know](http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i32/32b01501.htm), _The Elements of Style_ by William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White was published by the MacMillan Publishing Company.  To this day the college students that read _The Elements of Style_ learn how to properly utilize; a semicolon, dashes, colons and the serial comma.  Thinking about it, the prose of none of these students was perfect: but with hard work their writing will be great!

You would anticipate such improvement when the book in question is regarded as being the best guide to direct and/or concise writing ever written.  An especially meaningful example of directness comes from the noted prose stylist, Herbert Spencer, who in his not ironically named _Philosophy of Style_ wrote about compelling examples:

In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous, the regulations of its penal code will be severe.

There is no doubt but that this second quotation is superior:

In proportion as men delight in battles, bullfights, and combats of gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack.

Spencer is a man who knows the proper insertion of the particular for expressive purposes is a subject with which all good writers should be familiar.  _The Elements of Style_ is both a great book and not tedious to read—but one must watch his or her step lest they depersonalize their prose for the foreseeable future.

Which is possible because the truth is, some of the advice they give has the effect of flattening prose: as when, for example, you are told not to use the adverb “tangledly” because no one, at least no one they know (or knew, depending on whether Strunk, White or the current editor, of the fourth edition, named Roger Angell, is the person who is speaking out against “tangledly”) ever said the word “tangledly” out loud, even though the word “tangledly” would literally be the most appropriate word to describe a sentence like, for example, this one.

So as not to inject too much of my own opinion into this celebration of _The Elements of Style_ today, I will stop this post here, hopefully long after you realize what it is I have done, which is to boldly piss on their grave.

Don’t use worlds like “tangledly” for fear they may come out mangledly?

_even though the word “tangledly” would literally be the most appropriate word to describe a sentence like, for example, this one._

“tangledly” is not an adjective and therefore would not be an appropriate word to describe a sentence or indeed anything else.

i had the same reaction, ajay, but given that the point of sek’s piece was to write badly, i thought this might be intentional bad writing.

(though if the point was more focused, sc. to write badly in a way that violates s&w’s rules, then to know whether sek intentionally used an adverb to modify a substantive, we would have to know whether s&w have a rule saying “never use an adverb to modify a substantive. if you do, your sentence is wrongly.” and i don’t have the time to reread s&w, which is indeed a lump of stupid.

though squared, if the point was to flout s&w’s rules \*and thereby\* to show that s&w’s rules are stupid, i don’t think the piece succeeds. if you want to do that, then you should flout their rules and write flawless, elegant, first-rate prose, or find it in the corpus of first-rate writers. that’s what e.g. pullum does.

by flouting the rules and at the same time writing something that sounds like the worst of freshman comp, this piece actually has the effect of making it seem that the rules are at least tracking some issues of hideousness. you don’t piss on the grave of rule-makers by saying, “look: when i flout your rules for good composition, i wind up producing a really bad composition!”)

but i can never understand sek in any case. sorry, scott–i enjoy your stuff, but i never feel like i can break in on the conversation you are having with yourself. it’s like it’s just too clever for me. so if i once again failed to get this, then please accept my apologies.

kid, it’s not easy to violate a stricture per sentence without the piece coming out wonky, so it came out wonky.  That said, I don’t think that validates Strunk & White: I suppose a better writer could’ve written a non-wonky invalidation of _The Elements of Style_, but when I tried to write elegantly while flouting their suggestions, I realized that much of it was sound advice.  (Plus, as I said somewhere else earlier this week, reading style guides always has a deleterious effect on my writing: I’m self-conscious enough as is, so guides just introduce yet another critical voice in a head that’s plenty crowded enough.)

yeah, i know about critical voices in the head. mine range from the merely amused to the sneering to the scathing to the truncheon-wielding–i try not to give those last thugs too much scope on the nets. just keep ’em to myself, so to speak.

sorry to add to the criticism. in particular, i realized that the ‘conversation with yourself’ line in my last is more a comment on me than on you. it’s a generational thing; i don’t understand a lot of the references you guys use these days, but i should concede that your intended audience probably does. it’s a conversation you’re having with your contemporaries; i just happened to be born a couple decades too long ago for it. still, 23 skidoo and all that.

**Anderson**

					

		

The book has been too highly praised and thus is due its comeuppance, but I recall feeling grateful for the candid explanation of when to punctuate inside quotation marks, and when outside; IIRC, the upshot was that I shouldn’t expect it to make any sense.  That was helpful.

Otherwise, all I remember are “Omit needless words” and the usage notes on “the foreseeable future” and “nauseous,” both of which I find occasion to recall at least once a month.  Though people who say “I feel nauseous” are probably in no mood to have me smiling.

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

The upside of “Omit needless words” is that it reminds us that verbosity is a defect. The downsides are that it doesn’t remind us that terseness is a defect too — and that it doesn’t help make the call, either way.

**Anderson**

					

		

_The downsides are that it doesn’t remind us that terseness is a defect too_

Omitting \*needless\* words is not a defect.  

Now, the rule doesn’t tell you what’s a needless word, but it at least introduces the concept.  

(Myself, I find that court rules on page limits are a great way to learn how to “omit needless words.”  Profs, always set both a minimum and a maximum page limit.)

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

Ben, are you disparaging commentary? What line of work are you in, again?

Anderson — I would say that omitting “needless” words can be overdone: the problem is the focus on individual words.  Bunting’s [“Cut out every word you dare”](http://www.dur.ac.uk/basil-bunting-poetry.centre/poems.quotes/quotes/) is part of a personal formula for a particular poetic style, perpetually running the risk of cramp.

**[Ben Alpers](http://us-intellectual-history.blogspot.com/)**

					

		

The problem with the edict to remove needless words is that it is a tautology. Of course _needless_ words should be removed as there is, by definition, no need for them.

_Ben, are you disparaging commentary? What line of work are you in, again?_

I’m in the midst of grading papers, in fact. If there was any implied disparagement of commentary in my previous comment, it was probably just wishful thinking.

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

_The problem with the edict to remove needless words is that it is a tautology._

We could trim words from this: for example, end with “is tautology”.  Thus, in the strict sense that S&W pretend to imply, “that it is a” are needless words.  But would that be an improvement?  It’s a matter of judgment, and I judge No.  Similarly, Ben’s second sentence there is repetitive, but repetitive for a reason — it’s performing tautology.  That is, it contains words which don’t answer to a need, exactly, but to a desire.  And this is legitimate!

Haters, the lot of you.  Strunk and White is awesome.  I’m going to invoke Orwell (who I think is also awesome on style issues)’s command to break any rules rather than say something barbarous, which is totally in keeping with S&W, who are not nearly as prescriptive as  people like to complain.  Clean direct writing is a good thing, and they did a lot to make it so.  So nyah.

Has anyone historicized EoS?  There’s a certain first-half-of-the-century, plain-style thing going on there.

I’m with Anderson and the Bitch.  At least when I encountered EoS, the core advice was useful: they put an editor in my head.  So as style advice, as good as any.  As grammar and usage advice silly, but all grammar and usage guides are silly.

Pullum’s piece is good.  I am a hater mostly because I find their style advice to be useful only for people who know when to ignore it (and of course, if they knew when to ignore it, they wouldn’t need the guide), and it’s really not a guide to grammar or syntax (and it has been taken that way.)

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

ben’s correct: I’m not a fan of subordinate conjunctions.  

I’m with dana as to the usefulness of _Elements_.  There are better style guides out there—ones, for example, containing chapters devoted to eliminating common ESL errors.  _Elements_ is many things, but first and foremost it’s a book designed by upper-class white readers who live in a print dominant culture.  That simply doesn’t describe the majority of my students: the ones who aren’t ESL often write worse than the ones who are, because at least ESL students have had some formal training.  (I’ve had students complain when I assign them sections from the ESL chapter, but when their problems are that basic, I’m left with little choice.)

So yes, _Elements_ is a quaint little relic, it’s still a relic . . . and one that cites Herbert Spencer as an authority on style, no less.  I mean:

Among reasons given for reprobating the policy of guarding imprudent people against the dangers of reckless banking, one was that such a policy interferes with that normal process which brings benefit to the sagacious and disaster to the stupid.

That’s from _his autobiography_.

_Which style guide(s) do you use, SEK?_

I’m not SEK, obviously, but I’d like to see what other people use. I’ve been using Joseph M. Williams’ _Style: Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace_. Students get it, and the papers improve.

I have nothing against either Strunk or White, though.

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

For my students, I have them use a version of _The Little Penguin Handbook_ “custom[ized] for the University of California, Irvine.”  Unlike _Elements_, it’s extremely technical, but it also means I can scribble “25d” in the margins and have a student read the section on “Vague Reference.”  At this point, I basically have it memorized, so I can mark drafts extremely quickly.  

As for me, I don’t use one anymore, because—as per above—I’ve internalized enough of them that I drive myself stupid when I try write to sentence clear on model by someone else made.  But the one I did use was [this one](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195090594/diesekoschmar-20), which I absolutely adored.

i think that commenting on blogs has improved my prose style, even when i go back to writing academic prose.

it’s strange–blog commenting means always writing to a deadline.

which can be good.

The truth is, the only part of Strunk and White I think I ever read was White’s essay.

It will surprise noöne to learn that my academic writing and my bloggy writing are not very similar.

Blogs definitely shorten the time between writing and being misunderstood.

_Here Scott omits the needless word “that”._

No, it’s only missing a comma, though it taxes the reader just slightly with respect to plural agreement.  Here, I’ll show you:

Spencer is a man who knows the proper insertion of the particular, for expressive purposes is a subject with which all good writers should be familiar.

First rule of garden path sentences: omit needless weeds.

My style guide has been my adviser, and while I’m sure that some of her aphorisms have been cribbed from more reputable sources, they’re still good things to have rattling around in your head when it comes time to edit.  I understand what folks are saying about feeling bound in by dogmatic rules (and my understanding of the grammar piece is that a lot of it was based on false generalizing of particular cases), but having something like “prefer verb forms to noun forms” echoing can be useful for answering the mysterious question of “why is this sentence dragging.”

Michael Turner, you’re kidding, right?

You have to be careful, though: I ended up writing my first chapter _for_ my adviser, which fact the rest of my committee was less than pleased with.  I know I’ve written about this before at some length, but all the keywords—writing, dissertation, voice—lead to pretty much every post I’ve ever written, so I can’t find it.  The short version would be this: I started blogging because I was in a corner, style-wise, trying to write something that pleased three people who with very different in taste and sensibility.  The end result was that I’d lost my voice and wrote like ass.  So I started a blog just to play around with, and it allowed me develop a different concept of audience—even when that audience consisted of five people and random hits from Google.

I’m reporting you haters to Homeland Security.  

Preach it, b! 

If half of Strunk and White’s critics wrote half as well as White does, you’d have one quarter of something or other, which would leave the other 3 quarters for Strunk and White, thus resulting in their triumph, and if that’s not irrefutable, nothing is.

_I started blogging because I was in a corner, style-wise, trying to write something that pleased three people who with very different in taste and sensibility._

The near-Japanglish hash you made of the last 8 words of that sentence very likely reflects a sort of [language interference](http://wiki.eflgeek.com/index.php/ESL-wiki/Language-Interference) stemming from the trauma of trying to master the idiolects of all three, while finishing graduate studies.  Especially if all three were on your committee.

Please understand that this is no grammar-nazi troll, SEK, but rather a hearfelt attempt to console you about certain misunderstood and underdiagnosed PTSD symptoms, concerning which there is vanishingly little in the literature.  This dearth is certainly because of (no, not due to, _because of_) a certain systemic bind within academia itself, particularly in any cross-disciplinary study of its own behavior.  “Dissertation Committee Member Idiolect Interference Phenomena among ABD Doctoral Candidates” was, in fact, my sociolinguistics/clinical-psych thesis topic, until one day I just so problematically couldn’t any more do it respectively.
