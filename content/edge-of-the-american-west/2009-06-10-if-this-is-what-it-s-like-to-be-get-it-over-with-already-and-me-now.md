Now that I about it, if I’m to run out of words, maybe I should in the sciences, where words don’t seem to be required:

I don’t know if anyone is checking the comments on this post anymore, but my 9-year old autistic son is absolutely cracking up over the “Ode to Joy” video. (Over and over and over again.)
