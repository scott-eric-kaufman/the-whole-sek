Harold Pinter—[Undeserving Laureate of a Prize that Doesn’t Matter Anymore Because Who Still Reads Literature Anyway](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/so\_now\_you\_care.html)?—died yesterday after a long struggle with esophageal cancer.  He will be missed.  [_Edited to remove an insensitive and unintentional pun._]
