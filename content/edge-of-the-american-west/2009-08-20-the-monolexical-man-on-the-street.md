A conservative woman, [Pamela Pilger, yells “Heil Hitler!” at Samuel Blum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHsUi2Hu4Ug#t=0m35s), an Israeli immigrant, as he’s being interviewed by a local television crew.  She’s unthinkingly and ignorantly odious.  Even were Blum not Jewish, shouting “Heil Hitler!” at a political opponent is never an acceptable option in civil discourse.  (Different standards no doubt apply at official Hitler Youth mixers.)  Although she’s the one berating a former Israeli citizen while wearing an Israeli Defense Forces shirt, the more interesting party is the man to her left.  There she is, with her IDF shirt on, and when the Blum mentions that he served [the required three years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel\_Defense\_Forces#Regular\_service) in the IDF, the man to her left [leans in and says . . .](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/the-monolexical-man-on-the-street.html#more)

(Also, for hogging the blog today.  Back to the woodshed in which student drafts are housed with me!)

Agreed, in any discursive mode. Also regardless of whether the woman is conservative or “liberal.” 

Socialism, communism, fascism, you know, they’re apparently all the same thing.

Other than the typical American left wing obsession to defend every crime committed by the Israeli state (see Alan Dershowitz for a very good example) I am not sure what is the point of this post. Israel is an apartheid state that denies 20%!o(MISSING)f its citizens full legal equality on the basis of their race. It also imposes a brutal military occupation upon millions of people who are not its citizens in the West Bank and Gaza. But, because Israel is the “Jewish State” and because Ben Gurion used a lot of socialist rhetoric no self described leftists such as SEK will ever criticise its use of white phospherous to murder children in Gaza.

Do you see anything Israel has done being defended or even mentioned in this post?

Making assumptions here, are you not? This _self-described leftist_ served as a voluntary undergrad guide for Palestinian diplomats to the Bay Area. As far as I know, I’m not sure they would interpret the post in the same manner (I can explicate with reasons and examples, if necessary). You may, perhaps understandably, be focusing on one facet.

_It also imposes a brutal military occupation upon millions of people who are not its citizens in the West Bank and Gaza_

The observation, “if there’s a hell on earth, it’s in or near the Gaza Strip,” made an impact on me, especially in the context of the budding Palestinian film effort. However, I need further elucidation on what you deem as a _sustained_ “brutal military occupation.”

What’s that old saw, about when you make an assumption you make a something about someone?  Because you know, I hear tell that there just may be a stereotype of a liberal self-loathing Jew who vehemently opposes the actions of the Israeli state whose name rhymes with “Momsky” . . . that, or, you know, J. Otto Pohl’s absolutely right about the content of this post.  (Wait, maybe it was “Pomsky”?  “Lomsky”?  “Romsky”?  Something like that, regardless.)

Wait, I remember now!  It was Flomsky—Poem Flomsky that I was thinking of!

(That, or J. Otto Pohl’s a damn dull troll.  Nope!  It’s definitely Poem Flomsky I was thinking about earlier with that stereotype that I mentioned when I, unlike J. Otto Pohl, wasn’t high.)

From J. Otto Pohl’s profile:

_I got my Ph.D. from SOAS in November 2004. I did it in two years which is I believe the record for shortest time at that institution._

In retrospect, he might have tried to take the degree at the normal pace and, you know, learned some stuff along the way.

I thought the stereotype of leftists was that they were too quick to defend the Palestinians even as they (the Palestinians, not the leftists, though that would be interesting)  detonated bombs in Israeli pizza parlors.  I learned that in year three of the PhD.

Look you can make fun of me all you want. But, in the US as opposed to the UK most of the mainstream left (Chomsky as an anarchist is not mainstream) has historically been pro-Israel and anti-Arab. There is even a term for it PEP. If you think Chuck Schumer, Alan Dershowitz, Paul Newman, Stephen Walzer, Barbra Boxer and other Zionists are all right wingers fine. But, the founders of Israel, people like Ben-Gurion, were self described socialists and the arms to commit the Nakba came fmainly rom Czechoslovakia with the support of Stalin and Beria. The fact that the Israelis portrayed themselves as not only the Jewish homeland, but a realization of Democratic Socialism brought them a huge amount of support from the mainstream US left. Support that really has not diminished. Israel gets treated with kid gloves by liberals and the mainstream American left because of its “Jewish” and previously “socialist” imagine. Even Chomsky does not support sanctions against Israel.

You still haven’t explained why that’s in the slightest bit relevant to what we were discussing.

At _best_, you’re conflating “liberal” with “left.” 

Chomsky doesn’t support sanctions? I’ve read Chomsky for years: he’s not one to toss off “solutions” but if he was being consistent he’d have to at least call for war crimes trials, and probably the dissolution of Israel as a Jewish state: sanctions would be too little, legally problematic, and, ironically, harder to sell to the public.

I know the US does not have the impressive history of tolerance for the Jews that Europeans have, but you know, just maybe, the US left has it right on this one.

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

My simplistic local yardstick for what’s left is KPFA — they’re certainly “self-described” leftists — and it’s resoundingly critical of Israel. The existence of another leftist who “comes out against” some specific boycott program (even assuming you’re right) is irrelevant.

(Is Mr. Pohl related to J.otto Seibold? And is Stephen Walzer the child of Michael Walzer and Stephen Walt?)

Not sure how reliable this is, but if you search “chomsky” “sanctions” “Israel” you get much more of the same.

I have had a monthly to quarterly email exchange with the good professor for a few years.  We have discussed Israel in depth, and he has never suggested sanctions.  Naomi Klein, yes, but she’s a different animal.

I meant Michael Walzer who is not a right winger, but he does justify most Israeli crimes. Look if you want to deny that American liberals and leftists have not historically turned a blind eye to Israeli human rights violations and racism, fine. But, I think if you look at the record the mainstream left in the US has been the strongest supporter of Israel right or wrong. Lots and lots of “progressives” support actions by Israel that they condemned when other governments did them. It is not difficult to go back and dig up lots and lots of praise for Israel and defense of its most barbaric actions by Americans describing themselves as being on the left.

Ah, think I see the problem.  You are comparing elected democrats and and some leftist (though, just so you know, no one has considered Alan Dershowitz anything but a right winger for years) to European leftists.  Plus you have 
ridiculous
 very strict stardards for what counts as critical of Israel.  Your confusion comes from the fact that the U.S. in general is disproportionately supportive of Israel.  There are a whole host of reasons for this, but you’re a bright guy and you could figure this out if you wanted.  US Democrats or “leftists” may be less universally critical of Israel than you would like (in fact it’s pretty much impossible to get elected to national office in this country without affirming support for Israel, though some folks get away with critical support), but the right is even more blank check support-y.  See Foreign Policy, Israel, Pres. George W. Bush.

So, yes, we are right to make fun of you.

JPool, I think J.Op has mistaken the comments section of this post for the SOAS Junior Common Room, where pointless arguments and accusations like this happen on a regular basis.

Please don’t mistake the pro-Hamas Socialist Workers Party (who have supported the Taliban because anti-imperialism trumps identity politics in their Marxist configuration) with the rest of the left.
