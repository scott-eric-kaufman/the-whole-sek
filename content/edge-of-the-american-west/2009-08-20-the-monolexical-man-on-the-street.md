A conservative woman, [Pamela Pilger, yells “Heil Hitler!” at Samuel Blum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHsUi2Hu4Ug#t=0m35s), an Israeli immigrant, as he’s being interviewed by a local television crew.  She’s unthinkingly and ignorantly odious.  Even were Blum not Jewish, shouting “Heil Hitler!” at a political opponent is never an acceptable option in civil discourse.  (Different standards no doubt apply at official Hitler Youth mixers.)  Although she’s the one berating a former Israeli citizen while wearing an Israeli Defense Forces shirt, the more interesting party is the man to her left.  There she is, with her IDF shirt on, and when the Blum mentions that he served [the required three years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel\_Defense\_Forces#Regular\_service) in the IDF, the man to her left [leans in and says . . .](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/the-monolexical-man-on-the-street.html#more)
