You should be ashamed of yourself, SEK.  This used to be a serious and dignified academic blog.

Eric threatened to kick me off the blog for not carrying my weight.  

“But I post regularly,” I said.

“More Muppets,” he mumbled back.

Thank you.  But can I say, having visted some muppets recently, Snuffleupagus is sorely missed.  And, who is Abby Cadabby?  I suppose I should actually watch the show \*with\* my daughter…

I’m wondering…was Jamie Farr the model for the Count?  I mean seriously, that could be Klinger working on another Section 8 attempt.
