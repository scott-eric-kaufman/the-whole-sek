A former student of mine from Iran heard from his brother for the first time in a couple of days.  When my student bemoaned the cautiousness of Obama administration’s statements, his brother confirmed one aspect of [Spencer Ackerman’s account of the administration’s behavior](http://washingtonindependent.com/46957/obamas-iran-policy-to-focus-on-human-rights-not-election), saying that government forces are already accusing protesters of collaborating with the U.S., and that protesters are actually _worried_ that Obama will make an explicit show of support, as that would restore some credibility to what the government has said about the election and, more importantly, could undermine a reform coalition in which some factions are none-too-fond of America.  [](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/06/madness-obama-administration-silent-as.html)

[Everyone](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/06/madness-obama-administration-silent-as.html) [prematurely](http://thinkprogress.org/2009/06/15/mccain-act-iran/) [condemning](http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/288543.php) the administration’s [apparent](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjVkMGRjYWFkMjg2MWJmY2VkN2RkMjczNWU0ODlhZTU=) [silence](http://legalinsurrection.blogspot.com/2009/06/he-who-cannot-stop-talking-is-silent-on.html) [on this](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2009/06/speak\_for\_america\_president\_ob.html) [matter](http://townhall.com/blog/g/2b117a45-e677-4e36-9e9f-1a26efaa97d0) may want to rethink the offensive idea that he’s merely “[voting ‘present.’](http://patterico.com/2009/06/15/iranians-detonate-reality-bomb/)”  I’m not saying we should take my student’s brother’s word on this as definitive, but it does make one point absolutely clear: most of the people complaining about the administration’s response are more concerned with playing American politics than the situation on the ground in Iran.
