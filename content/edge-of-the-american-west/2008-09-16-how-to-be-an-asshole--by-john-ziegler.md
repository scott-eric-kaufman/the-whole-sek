1. Use someone’s suicide to repeat cheap talking points:

I was neither as surprised, nor as upset by this tragedy as the many in the elite realm of reputable literature seemed to be.

2. Use someone’s suicide to assert your own importance:

I have a truly unique perspective on David Foster Wallace’s suicide.

3. Criticize someone for being polite and modest:

I found him to be more than a bit eccentric, but certainly nice enough not to be bothered too much by his presence.

4. Claim someone spent:

[A]t least two months following my every move before and during the broadcast of my show.

5. Then claim this person:

[H]ad intended to write a hit piece on talk radio and use me as the easy and naïve target.

6. Flaunt your ignorance:

I am embarrassed to say that I did not even know who David Foster Wallace was and I was too stupid or lazy to bother to simply “Google” him. It was only when the article was finally published that I realized what a “big deal” he was supposed to be.

7. Remind people of it:

[A]nyone who attempts to read the 23-page cover story is immediately struck by the use of many boxes off to the side of each page where Wallace shares his parenthetical thoughts/statements to his undisciplined telling of the story.

8. Once you’ve admitted surprise at the foonotes—thereby demonstrating you did no more research _after_ you allowed him access than you did _before_—speak hard truths about his talent:

But I also believe that there is an equally fine line between real genius and just plain weirdness. In my experience, Wallace had very little of the former, so he exaggerated the latter.

9. Glory in the evaluative freedom your ignorance affords you:

It is therefore far better to be weird and thought, at worst, to be “too smart for the room,” than to play it straight and be revealed as a “one hit wonder” or even a total fraud.

10. Despite “absolutely no evidence to backup [sic] this assertion,” claim this fraud committed suicide for personal gain:

While I have absolutely no evidence to backup this assertion, I also think it is quite possible that he knew that killing himself in his “prime” and before he had been totally exposed as being a mere mortal in the literary realm would cement his status as a “genius” forever.

11. Be a talentless AM radio hack whose name no one will remember tomorrow and write this:

David Foster Wallace was an overrated writer in life. His suicide should not be used to elevate him even further beyond what he deserved, in death.

12. Acknowledge this:

I know that it is considered bad form, or worse, to speak ill of the newly dead[.]

13. [Then do it anyway](http://johnziegler.com/editorials\_details.asp?editorial=165).

Scott,

Here’s another:

Call him a fraud and misspell “sleight of hand”.

Wow, that is certainly a master class in being an asshole. My opinion of Ziegler from Host wasn’t actually that low. It now is.

There you go again, making me out to be a Zinfandel-sipping elitist ’cause I’ve never heard of John Z.  Actually that can’t be true, ’cause this triggers a synapse re a DFW piece on a radio blowhard — this is the fellow?

That is the fellow, Colin.  

Bill, I wanted to use the phrase “master class,” but thought no one who didn’t read Robertson Davies would catch the reference.

Nate, he did indeed.  (Also, you were formally thanked for your work.  Can’t remember if I ever sent a last thank you, but if I didn’t, I’m about to.)

He (Zeigler) writes like he’s still trying to get over a sixth-grade locker-room beating. A pathetic fungus masquerading as a human being.

Thank you for bringing my attention to the existence of this entity, and to the fact that its existence isn’t worth my attention.

Killing oneself for personal gain is one a them fucking for virginity thingummies, isn’t it?

What a piece of work.

**brandon**

					

		

never been on zeigler’s website before today, (linked from the DFW site “howling fantods”) but zeigler’s page has no place for comments or contact? 

wondering if this was a feature disabled after the DFW piece? he knew would draw flak (and seemed proud of it) as evidenced by this quote on his front page: 

“John Ziegler has written what is sure to be a controversial take on Wallace’s suicide here.”

…and also refers to “Host” as “infamous.” sounds like someone’s a grumpy gus because one of DFW’s admittedly weaker works will still overshadow Zeigler’s pathetic career forever.

**[bitchphd](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com)**

					

		

You somehow missed the whole tone of moral and intellectual superiority afforded by the suicide of a far better man.

What a complete asshole.  DFW was too kind to him.

You know what’s even worse?  [He’s _proud_ of this](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/#22292) — then again, he manufactures controversy for a living, so he would be.

Stealing from Rich Puchalsky:

_And the “must have really hit a nerve” is a classic attention-seeking jerk phrase.  As in: did I just call your mom a prostitute?  You seem mad about that—I must have really hit a nerve!_

“but to me all bets are off when one commits suicide, especially when that person is a husband and a father”

I ask, because I truly don’t know (and don’t recall seeing it in any of the news stories about his death): Was he a father?

He was a step-father to an adult son, I believe.

When I read “Host,” I thought, “DFW must be exaggerating. John Ziegler could not possibly be such an asshole.”

It is very gratifying to know that he was dead-on. The arrogance, the rage, the complete inability to empathize with another person: John Z is just such an asshole as DFW described.

I move that we rename some of the bens, or give them version numbers.

A minor radio personality is written about by a famous writer.  The minor radio personality comes across in the article like a fool.  Some years later, the famous writer kills himself, whereupon the minor radio personality – almost immediately! – writes an article describing the famous writer as a no-talent hack and moral coward.  It seems to be true that we are most likely to accuse other people of the faults we suspect are our own.

I am not the world’s biggest DFW fan, but Ziegler surely gets the polonium star for being a despicable coward, with a special mention in the callous scumbag category.

**JA**

					

		

And Ziegler isn’t the only self-obsessed, self-serving, corporate-bought megaphone for the squirming self-regard of his own ego (as well as being a shamelessly opportunistic grave stomper): there’s also OJ Simpson. These two make good bedfellows. I hope they don’t forget to kiss each other goodnight; we wouldn’t want them to become worried at hearing the twin howling echo from their empty souls, now would we…

This guy Ziegler obviously has a severe personality disorder. I caught his schtick about some “documentary” he’s made about the election, with his premise being that Obama voters are stupid and uninformed due to the media (?). When he left KFI in Los Angeles, he put up a website alleging one of his fellow station partners was gay (so?) and that most others were frauds somehow.  

I could tell when I saw him on the tube tonight that he was whacked.  

He also seems to have a problem with racism, as he repeatedly condescendingly claims “that would be racist” when discussing his questionable attitudes on matters of race.  

John Ziegler is a punk.
