## False advertising

I’ve been thinking quite a bit about book covers lately — less because I’ll produce anything worthy of one than how _dreadful_ the covers of most academic books are.  You’d think the book-designing _avant-garde_ would be thrilled to work with people unconcerned with sales or money, yet the best cover I’ve seen in ages still falls prey to [put-a-giant-fingerprint on-a-book-about-fingerprints](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674010027/diesekoschmar-20) logic.

That said, it could be worse:

Had I access to my old laptop and its surplus of image manipulation software, you’d be treated to covers of novels entitled _POISONED!_ featuring drowned bodies.

Or [something like this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/treasure.jpg).  (Only better.)

What does it mean that it’s “with Jack Dubrul”?  Is Clive Cussler dead and they have drones writing his books now?  I suppose I could look, but you’re the literature guy.  (Enjoy the low-hanging fruit.)

Scott, you obviously haven’t read this book. It’s a stirring period piece about a plague _of bombs_.

I’m not sure when this Masterpiece of The Literatures was written, Ari, but I don’t suppose it much matters whether Cussler is dead or alive.  It’s not like there’s some essential _je ne sais quoi_ his death would rob us (or his novels) of.

todd., I actually thought it might’ve been related to spontaneous combustion. 

“Dear, have you tried the mustard greens?”

“No, my darling, I haven’t.”

“I wouldn’t recommend — 

**KABOOM!**

I clearly have no idea what happens in Cussler novels, but when I saw the cover at [_uber-mega-chain bookstore I’m ashamed to say I patronized yesterday_], it just seemed _wrong_.

No, Vance, it’s the sheer weight of pestilence that’s dragging the center of the ship to a watery grave.  Sheesh, learn some science.

I like that fingerprint book cover. Very literal, yet subtly referencing Swiss modernism. Got that nice red grid thing going.

mcmc, I like it too.  But “like” ain’t quite “salivate,” and I’ve salivated over covers in the past … only none of them countenanced arguments by academics.  We deserve better than [_covers I won’t link to for fear of giving offense to the people from whom I will soon beg on bended knee for a job … from_].  (Stupid English.)

My superhero team in high school ([GO FORCE!](http://www.archive.org/details/nc117\_weird\_web)) had an enemy called “Plastique”.  Why did they call her Plastique?  Because she was POISON.

As far as false advertising goes, early direct-to-video sci-fi movies with painted covers suffered from a similar issue.

It’s easy to look down your nose at mass-trash-writing.  

Cussler’s book covers may be obvious, but so are his sales numbers.  It’s not even mediocre literature —  it’s not even literature — but it sure has an audience.  The guy’s got about a zillion bucks.

And my financial envy notwithstanding (how many more times do I have to read “payment in copies” in the Writer’s Market?), at least it gets people reading.  And, more than likely, people who otherwise wouldn’t read.

If any of you philistines had taken note of the subliminal radioactivity symbol hovering _uber alles_, you’d know the ends of the ship are rising because they’re radioactive.  Because radioactivity, as everybody knows, is lighter than air.

You guys are more public than intellectual.  Cripes.

_Will you look at that? Urbino’s right: on the art and the physics._

Upon further review, I’m only right about the physics (as usual).  That’s the biohazard symbol, which an old biologist like me should not forget.

See, if you guys were real public intellectuals, you could’ve headed off this embarrassing episode by stating right up front: “This is a biohazard symbol, not a radioactivity symbol.”  But did you?  No.  And look where it’s led.  The terrorists win.

I think, picking up on your love of transgressives, they hate all creatures that cross the usual boundaries of decorum.  The duck loves both the air and the water.  This is immoral.  Likewise the turtle and the frog.  When was the last time you saw a box turtle in a madrassa?  That’s what I thought.

On second thought, they can have the frogs.  They eat kittens.

“they hate all creatures that cross the usual boundaries”

theophrastus refers to a kind of fish that crawls out onto the land to sleep at night, and calls it an “exôkoitos”.

later ichthyologists gave this name to the flying-fish

the french devised an air-launched, anti-ship missile, and gave it this name, too, frenchified to “exocet”.

and it was an exocet that the argentinians used to sink the hms sheffield.

just a coincidence, you say?

This Theophrastus character sounds foreign to start with.  That should’ve been an immediate tipoff.  Any fish that would associate with him clearly has terrorist sympathies.  Either you’re for us, or you’re against us, by god.

_Kittens?_

A frog will eat anything it can catch and fit in its mouth, including, in the case of big bullfrogs, kittens.

I like Charlie Rose.  If I could have any job, I’d be tempted to ask for his.  Though I think it’d be very hard, actually.  And then there’s those nights when he gets a bit chummy with Kissinger, and that sort of makes my skin crawl.  Just thought I’d share.
