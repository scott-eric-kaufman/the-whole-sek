… and [vet Palin](http://content.vetpalin.com/index.html)!  Start with a trip to Wasilla’s [historic City Hall](http://www.cityofwasilla.com/ftp/tour/cityhall/Tourviewer\_cityhall.html):

That building is ugly!  Too bad it doesn’t go back to the days of the WPA, the architecture would be a lot better!

On my vacation this summer I discovered the art deco city hall in Cody Wyoming (of all places).  Don’t know if it has WPA connections.

You know, the McCain campaign is right.  Running the Wasilia city government is clearly better preparation for the U.S. presidency than chairing the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees.

So Bristol’s pregnancy’s being presented as either a) something the team learned about when they vetted her, or b) a good reason to ask whether she was, in fact, fully vetted. (The Post is emphasizing the former and the Times the latter, citing more than just the pregnancy.)

I suppose it’s possible that they _did_ know about the pregnancy after vetting her and decided to make the gamble that the faithful (in all senses) would rally around Palin as an ordinary woman and a tried-by-fire pro-lifer, which seems so far to be the case. _And_ they’d have to gamble that such a rally would drown out questions about her other problems.

How can there not be more concern, though, among ordinary Republican voters that McCain _hadn’t even met her in person_ until the day before he announced her as his running mate?

Here’s one [impression](http://www.washingtonindependent.com/3767/palin-involved-in-ousting-scandals-from-the-start) of the town:

Driving around this city today, I decided it looks more or less like a string of strip malls, 45 minutes northeast of Anchorage. I couldn’t help but think that being mayor of a place like this would be something akin to running a large neighborhood watch.
