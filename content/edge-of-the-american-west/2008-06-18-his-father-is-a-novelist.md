## His father is a novelist

So I’m not cracked to be thinking [this Yglesias post](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/the\_pure\_line.php) was a poem, considering [how it rendered in Google Reader](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/mypoet.jpg).  The first two lines are easy enough to improve — drop the “that” and “and energy to,” or maybe “time and … to” — but the third and fourth are a mess, but one with potential.  I’d love to find a way to squeeze the bureaucratize of “official gatherings of descendants of Thomas Jefferson” into a single line, but alas, I’m doomed to failure.

So not a _well-crafted_ poem, but a poem nonetheless.  

Only not.  

(And yes, I need new glasses.)
