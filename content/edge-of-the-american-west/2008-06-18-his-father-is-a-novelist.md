## His father is a novelist

So I’m not cracked to be thinking [this Yglesias post](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/the\_pure\_line.php) was a poem, considering [how it rendered in Google Reader](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/mypoet.jpg).  The first two lines are easy enough to improve — drop the “that” and “and energy to,” or maybe “time and … to” — but the third and fourth are a mess, but one with potential.  I’d love to find a way to squeeze the bureaucratize of “official gatherings of descendants of Thomas Jefferson” into a single line, but alas, I’m doomed to failure.

So not a _well-crafted_ poem, but a poem nonetheless.  

Only not.  

(And yes, I need new glasses.)

Poetry must be as well-written as prose, like the man said.

Odd — does Google Reader have some kind of spelling and punctuation correction built into it? It does look kind of poetic but I have trouble believing Yglesias is the author.

TMK, are you suggesting that poetry is less susceptible to homophones and the Cupertino effect?

More seriously, dry hypersyllabic prose is not intrinsically antithetical to poetry.  What’s-his-name pointed that way with the _Propertius_, but jokingly; for a more serious counterexample one could look to Charles Olson.  Indeed it’s kind of hard to say what a poem is not.

You could sing it to the tune of Dylan’s “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll”

A tree.

Tax-deductible charitable organizations.

Or is it “charity”?  I forget.

“Charity”, so it scans just fine (mainly anapestic).

I know very little of poetry, but teo has created an opening into which I can lob “eleemosynary,” which is a word I get so few opportunities to lob.  Does it work in there anywhere?

[Here it is](http://www.threecandles.org/reviews/vseshadri\_gallery.html) (second poem) used by Vijay Seshadri.  Self-consciously.  It has a strange rhythm and a ring of Church Latin….
