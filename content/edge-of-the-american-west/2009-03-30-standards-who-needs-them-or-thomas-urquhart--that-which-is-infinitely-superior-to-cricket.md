Teaching composition exclusively leads to (1) a greater appreciation for the pedestrian complexity of correctly subordinated clauses and (2) a bone-tiredness for the unmerited praise of student peer reviews.  As someone with a penchant for paragraph-length sentences, I find (1) wholly salutary; but (2) irks me endlessly.  Why?  In one of my undergraduate History of the English Language course, the professor handed out slips of paper on which he had written a single sentence and told everyone to decipher what it meant, because he wanted us to present the sentence and the paraphrase to the class in ten minutes.  My sentence read:

Another thing there is that fixeth a grievous scandal upon that nation in matter of philargyrie, or love of money, and it is this: There hath been in London, and repairing to it, for these many years together, a knot of Scotish bankers, collybists, or coine-coursers, of traffickers in merchandise to and againe, and of men of other professions, who by hook and crook, _fas et nefas_, slight and might, (all being as fish their net could catch), having feathered their nests to some purpose, look so idolatrously upon their Dagon of wealth, and so closely, (like the earth’s dull center), hug all unto themselves, that for no respect of vertue, honour, kindred, patriotism, or whatever else, (be it never so recommendable), will they depart from so much as one single peny, whose emission doth not, without any hazard of loss, in a very short time superlucrate beyond all conscience an additionall increase to the heap of that stock which they so much adore; which churlish and tenacious humor hath made many that were not acquainted with any else of that country, to imagine all their compatriots infected with the same leprosie of a wretched peevishness, whereof those _quomodocunquizing_ clusterfists and rapacious varlets have given of late such cannibal-like proofs, by their inhumanity and obdurate carriage towards some, (whose shoe-strings they are not worthy to unty), that were it not that a more able pen than mine will assuredly not faile to jerk them on all sides, in case, by their better demeanour for the future, they endeavour not to wipe off the blot wherewith their native country, by their sordid avarice and miserable baseness, hath been so foully stained, I would at this very instant blaze them out in their names and surnames, notwithstanding the vizard of Presbyterian zeal wherewith they maske themselves, that like so many wolves, foxes, or Athenian Timons, they might in all times coming be debarred the benefit of any honest conversation.

That would be from the [_EKΣKYBAΛAYPON_](http://books.google.com/books?dq=Thomas+Urquhart&client=firefox-a&pg=PA177&id=eU0JAAAAQAAJ#PPA177,M1) of Thomas Urquhart, best known for his translations of Rabelais.\* In Urquhart, Rabelais found less a translator than a kindred spirit; but in Urquhart’s prose, I found an unparaphraseable wall of words, before which I stood befuddled but impressed.  Granted, I _should_ have been impressed, so the analogy to peer reviews is imperfect; but my comprehension and subsequent paraphrase of Urquhart amounted to what I abhor in peer reviews: salivation at the sight of a dependent clause containing multiple polysyllabes and a “Good!” slapped in the margins—as if knowing big words and including them complex sentences means someone’s saying anything meaningful.  But now that I teach composition exclusively, I see similar instances of unmerited praise [_everywhere_](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/29/RVF916KM93.DTL&feed=rss.books):

When most former major leaguers write memoirs, you wonder why they bothered; with Ron Darling—Yale graduate, former New York Met and Oakland A, and current Mets broadcaster—you wonder why it took him so long. What other former athlete could write a sentence like this even with assistance from a professional writer (Daniel Paisner): “This right here [[his legendary college pitching duel against St. Johns star Frank Viola](http://books.google.com/books?id=5\_9o-afj1nwC&dq=angell+%!g(MISSING)ame+time%!&(MISSING)printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=xsjKgts5xb&sig=i93Xsi5qRw6MFlkr1HaE80iFBxM&hl=en&ei=3tLPSZexF5fItAO4-9ygAw&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA213,M1)\*\*] was one of the great epiphanies for me as a competitive athlete, only it took a while for it to resonate.” Most former pitchers can’t resonate even with help.

Just so you know, my love of _béisbol_ [knows no limits](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/a-modernist-lineup-.html); moreover, my love of the Mets generally, and [Ron Darling](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/don\_delillo\_scr.html?cid=14896293#comment-14896293) in particular—both as a player _and_ announcer—is unimpeachable.  But for the _San Fransisco Chronicle_ to praise a Yale graduate who double-majored in French and Southeast Asian history and who speaks both Chinese and French fluently—to praise him (if it _was_ him and _not_ his co-writer) for using the words “epiphany” and “resonate” makes me want to quodlibetificate into demission this clusterheaded intelligentry, the miserable baseness of whose expectations ought to debar them from the profession of letters.

Before anyone thinks I reneged on the deal: I meant to x-post this simultaneously, but apparently set it to post in the future instead.

I have no idea what you’re talking about or what point you’re making once you switch to béisbol, but the Urquhart was great fun to read out loud in a variety of silly and dramatic accents.  The most fun?  Unsurprisingly, an incredibly overdone Scottish, with a low heavy river of r-trilling running beneath it.

Also, posts come, posts go, but I need you to understand just how much I love and miss kudzu.

This sentence of Urquhart’s goes some way to explaining Alasdair Gray’s story “Logopandocy”.

That sentence is pretty damn clunky for the work of a Yale graduate.

_Future posting? Freaking socialist._

When I expect to edit something significantly, I usually set it to post in three days, that way I have a running clock that only pressures revisions gently.  I forgot to reset it when I—who am I kidding?  SOCIALISTS OF THE WORLD UNITE AND BURN SHIT DOWN!

_I have no idea what you’re talking about or what point you’re making once you switch to béisbol_

All I could produce in the face of the Urquhart was befuddled praise, which is basically all my students _and professional writers in the **SF Chronicle**_ can produce in the face of the word “epiphany.”  That’s all.

_Unsurprisingly, an incredibly overdone Scottish, with a low heavy river of r-trilling running beneath it._

Check out [this comment](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/standards\_who\_needs\_them\_or\_thomas\_urquhart\_that\_which\_is\_infinitely\_superi/#24537), then.  Or just read the whole thing at the link.  I think Urquhart’s great fun, accents notwithstanding.

_Also, posts come, posts go, but I need you to understand just how much I love and miss kudzu._

As do I.  Spent a long time crafting that final sentence and was sad to see it go, but apparently my meaning wasn’t apparent, so I’ll save it for a future post.  (Because I’m a SOCIALIST!)

_This sentence of Urquhart’s goes some way to explaining Alasdair Gray’s story “Logopandocy”._

[It should](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas\_Urquhart#References).

_That sentence is pretty damn clunky for the work of a Yale graduate._

That it is.

I think the precis would be “I hate Scottish bankers”, a sentiment not entirely unknown in our own day.

Something is superior to cricket? That’s fighting talk.

Darling is a good announcer now? He was brutal when he was in Washington — his presentation was so bad (it was like he didn’t know how to be on tv, when to talk, when not to talk) that whatever substantive things he had to say never got said. Those seem like fixable problems, and he’s a smart guy so presumably he’s fixed them, but wow…

(Also, in his defense, I think they hired him like a week before the season began, so some of his obvious discomfort — and it was really obvious — had to do with the fact that he didn’t know the team or the players at all.)

_Darling is a good announcer now?_

The SNY announcers are by far—_by far_—the most entertaining and oddly erudite broadcast team around.  An inning might begin with an informed digression about _Don Quijote_ from Keith Hernandez and move into Darling doing a pitch-sequence analysis from the last inning, with occasional interruptions by Gary Cohen about what’s actually, you know, happening on the field.  So while I’m sure he’s less awkward now than he was then, the SNY people have also worked that awkwardness into the show.  (The only non-working awkwardness involves Keith’s stories: Darling tries to get him to stop, but Keith keeps moving along, then right before the punchline it dawns on him that he’s about to say something about cocaine or prostitutes and he stops, the booth goes quiet, then Cohen says something about the game.  Even this, though, has the feel of a routine, as last season Keith would talk about people being out until 3 a.m. and no one remembered how they got to the . . . children’s hospital, and with all these balloons too, isn’t that the oddest thing?)

So while I’m admittedly biased—_two_ ’86 Mets! abundant literature talk!—they really are worth listening to.  I mean, the alternative is listening to Vin Scully talk about [Carlos Beltran’s monkey](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/the\_commonplace\_2.html) _again_.  

Funny thing about Vin Scully: when I was growing up, I always thought his name was “Vince Ully.”  I stopped paying attention to baseball after the strike, and when ’99 rolled around, I realized that I’d been wrong _for more than a decade_, which is a long time to be wrong.

Anti-Scottish sentiment is not unknown in London today; one of the candidates for Mayor ran as an “English Nationalist”, with posters devoted entirely to denigrating the Scots for being greedy, tight-fisted, speaking funny etc. His name, rather awesomely, was Matthew O’Connor.
