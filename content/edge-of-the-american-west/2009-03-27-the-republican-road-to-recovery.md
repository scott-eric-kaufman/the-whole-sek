The sad part is that picture is 100%!T(MISSING)rue Fact.

Should I read this as saying “the Republican Road to Recovery will cause a Spectacular Obama Failure” or as “_even if_ the GOP gets on the Road to Recovery, they’ll still need Spectacular Obama Failure to get the White House in 2012″?

I suspect the latter is closer to the truth, even if the GOP somehow gets that crucial Jesus endorsement and disproves evolution.

In the [original](http://www.gop.gov/solutions/budget/road-to-recovery-final), these much-mocked diagrams aren’t actually flowcharts of proposed action — rather, they’re roadmaps to the document in hand, like outline slides in a PowerPoint preso. The first one, for example, on p. 3, reads “Curbs spending / Lowers taxes / Creates jobs / Controls debt”; these correspond to the three major sections (p. 4, 9 (two heads in one) and 14 respectively).

That said, they’re pretty lame, in part because they invite misreading as action.

Thanks for the pointer, Vance.  I read some of it.  I lurned sum very impotent thingz.  I now know that we Americans have a choice: between medical care that’s cheaper, better and more convenient, and medical care that’s more expensive, worse, and accessible only to those willing to tramp five miles through deep snow.

It’s like, “You can have this GOP pony or that Democrat giant squid, it’s entirely up to you.”

Just a sec, got Jesus on line one, about some debunking of evolutionary theory.

no wonder i vote d. aren’t the republicans even \*trying\* to appeal to squid-loving americans? how are they going to win elections without the crucial bloc of mollusco-americans?

also: i like ponies, but my giant squid is going to totally kick it’s ass if i \*let\* it. hold it back, boys! i don’t want a pony on my conscience!

some chum you are.

Absolutely, kb!

I, too, prefer teh squid.  Butcher it, throw it in the freezer, and you have enough fried calamari to last the bottled water, sewing needle, and ammunition phase of the recovery.

Pony, on the other hand, renders less meat and is probably fairly gamey and unpleasant.

One of the most memorable meals I’ve ever eaten involved a carpaccio of thinly sliced raw colt (no joke; this was in Cremona).

Off topic, did anyone else wonder about [Obama meeting the bankers](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/business/economy/28bank.html) “[s]itting at the center of a round table in the state dining room”? I picture him on a lazy Susan….

_We unbranded bovines consume unbranded equines with equanimity._

I’d imagine they’re better with a chimichurri.

She walks, she talks, she’s full of chalk…

 Just as a thought experiment, anyone want to hazard a guess on what the GOP could donext?  The standard memes of the past two decades do not seem to have much, if any appeal, to the majority of the electorate…so what do they try next?

 Out and out “national greatness” nationalism? 

 Economic nationalism, promising a move toward autarky?

 Populism at home and isolationism abrod? 

 If the GOP has lost the suburban middle class and at least some elements of the economic elite, do they go – substantially – after the working class, with policies and rhetoric? The TR-style, Progressive, trust-busting route?

 Straight up theocracy? (Not a winner, generally, but they could hang on to Utah…)

 Thoughts?

You can’t eat giant squid – its flesh is loaded with ammonia. Normal squid, yes. Giant squid, no.
