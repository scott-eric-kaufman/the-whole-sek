Should you ever be interviewed by _The History Channel_ in your office, it would be best not to have the _Wikipedia **** _entry for the topic about which they are interviewing you _clearly visible_ on your monitor.  Have a little faith in your expertise or dignity enough to close that damn tab.\*

\*Shamelessly stolen from my own [_Facebook_ note](http://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman) of a couple days past, but posted here because some member of the increasingly [Duggar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18\_Kids\_and\_Counting)-esque family of _The History Channel_ networks repeated the episode of _Mega Movers_ in which I first noticed it . . . and because it’s sound advice.
