Should you ever be interviewed by _The History Channel_ in your office, it would be best not to have the _Wikipedia ****_ entry for the topic about which they are interviewing you _clearly visible_ on your monitor.  Have a little faith in your expertise or dignity enough to close that damn tab.\*

\*Shamelessly stolen from my own [_Facebook_ note](http://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman) of a couple days past, but posted here because some member of the increasingly [Duggar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18\_Kids\_and\_Counting)-esque family of _The History Channel_ networks repeated the episode of _Mega Movers_ in which I first noticed it . . . and because it’s sound advice.

“It’s excellent advice,” says the woman who, no matter how hard she tries, can’t resist googling “How to Teach X” right before she has to go to a class on X.

A couple of threads ago, we established that Wikipedia is constantly being edited to bring it into conformity with XKCD–so why look up something in Wikipedia?  Why not go directly to the source?

Maybe, maybe the Wikipedia article is up there because he was, I dunno, writing or editing it? I’ll grant it’s unlikely, but is a possibility. Though, as I’ve learned from this blog, just because you’re on TV you’re suddenly “an expert” in whatever field they run through the tilting software to lend credibility to the story they’re selling.
