You’d think a “Best Group Blog” could manage to publish _something_ more exciting than its “About” page.  More seriously, I think our top posts reflect the interests of the blog rather neatly: history, literary history, contemporary politics mixed with historical reflection, and solipsism.  (What?  You think _other people_ are reading our “About” page?)

Solipsism is its own reward.

As always, arbitrary lists bring to mind the wealth that’s been omitted by the arbitrary number (And why 12, by the way? –  especially since one of them is from 2007, (a fine post, nonetheless.)) A couple of Mr. Maverick’s posts come immediately to mind, as well as a fine guest post by Teofilo,  some work by the neglected Dave Noon (Thirteen is a nice example), and  N. Merrill’s series on meta-ethics as well as Dana’s nice ruminations on  Leibniz.  All in all there have been riches here this year and I’m grateful that you’ve been so generous.

I’m guessing that these are the top twelve posts, in terms of traffic, from the past year.  I don’t think SEK was making any value judgments.

**[dana](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com)**

					

		

I like my arugula poem.  

And ari’s right, this is just in terms of traffic.  Which means a significant portion of our traffic are people saying, so who the hell are these clowns?

grackle –  

12 is selected to avoid 13\*, thereby continuing to arbitrarily  ignore Dave.  Sometimes, life just ain’t fair.

dana –  

Where might one find said poem?

_a fine guest post by Teofilo_

Aw, thanks.  Which post?

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

As someone who’s spent years in the sabrmetric community, I’m more attuned than most to the idea of arbitrary cut-offs.  So I’ll admit my bias: I wanted “Too rude?” in there, and needed to go Top Twelve to do so.

(But yes, Ari’s right: this is what brought in the most traffic.  I did neglect to mention the SEK-to-cobloggers ratio, however, and ought to be commended for that.)  (Esp. since I’ve been a suck-ass blogger this year, outside election-oriented material.)

Well, you know, traffic numbers are deceptive.  Sometimes awe and admiration make one speechless, and there you go — no numbers.  I’ve seen it several times on this very blog.

Teofilo, I particularly liked the post on Don Diego de Vargas Zapata Luján Ponce de León.  Good stuff.

Congratulations on the award — I can’t remember when I started reading this blog but it’s each day it’s as fresh and engaging as the last. Keep up the good work!

_the SEK-to-cobloggers ratio_

I once had a part-time job helping a corn farmer keep his books, keeping a record of his crops.

Yeah, I was a coblogger.

Seems to me a ‘coblogger’ would be more maize lumberjackesqe and less bookkeeping.  But what do I know.

So much brilliance in this thread.

And inspiration.

Can one negate the other?

I think people are going to the “About” page to find Eric’s email address, since he’s so mean about just telling us when we email him to ask.

I’ll give you my email address if you ask nicely.
