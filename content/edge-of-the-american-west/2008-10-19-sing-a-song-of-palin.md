## Sing a song of Palin

Via [Kyle Gann](http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2008/10/taking\_responsibility\_for\_my\_i.html)—my [second-favorite](http://www.artsjournal.com/quickstudy/) ArtsJournal blogger—comes this mesmerizing clip of someone “appl[ying] the exact same rhythmic technique to Sarah Palin that [he] did to Custer.”  That it’s the “_exact same_ rhythmic technique” is a claim I believe but can’t evaluate—I don’t know squat about composition, and what little I know I’ve picked up from reading Gann.  _Deliberately_.  So, you can guess which part of [this](http://www.kylegann.com/Custune2.html) I understand.  Now, re-read that last paragraph and then listen to an excerpt of “[Custer: If I Were an Indian…](http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/Gannaudio.html)”  [**UPDATE:** You can download the entire work [here](http://www.kylegann.com/Gannaudio.html).]

Compelling, aint it?  

But enough about my rank ignorance.  Here’s Palin:

That’s pretty great.

Gann put up the whole of “Custer and Sitting Bull” somewhere. It, too, is pretty great!

You’re right, ben, [he did put the whole thing online](http://www.kylegann.com/Gannaudio.html).  Let me update that link.

Palin’s kinda jazzy.  I like her better this way than _a capella_ (not that it would take much….)

How is it that I’m just now learning of this piece on “Custer and Sitting Bull”?

Michael, don’t take this the wrong way, but given the awesomeness of [_Custerology_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226201465/diesekoschmar-20), I’m surprised you were unfamiliar with Gann’s work.  I mean, I learned most of what I know about Custer from you, so this untidy inversion is just, well, _wrong_.

the human voice.

it sometimes behaves so strangely.

a question about etymology, since you guys are aware of all internet traditions.

in that last comment, i hesitated between putting up the url for the crooked timber story, or just giving credit to kieran, by using the internet tradition of tipping one’s hat (e.g. “h/t to kieran”).

after deciding to go with the full url, i was struck by the fact that “http” is what you get if you disemvowel “hat tip”.

obviously “http” does not come from “hat tip” (it’s from, what, hypertext transfer protocol? helping trolls talk politely?).

but perhaps the rise of “h/t” in the blogosphere does have something to do with the antecedent prevalence of “http://”? why this instead of, e.g., the texter’s “thx”? 

the amazing thing is that , whether there is any truth to this or not, it may well be found in a footnote in some book about the internet after the next dark ages, liebowitz-style.

One great example of this compositional technique is in Steve Reich’s “[Different Trains](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/difftrains.html),” a piece for tape recording and string quartet.  The tapes play interviews with various people and the quartet parts echo the vocal inflections and rhythms, bounce them around, and so on.  (The voices come from people being interviewed about different trains in the 40s– American rail workers and Holocaust survivors.  Perks up parties like you wouldn’t believe.)

wtf?  My insightful comment about Steve Reich’s “different trains” just disappeared….anyway, another example of that compositional technique.

there’s so much about Custer that I don’t know….  In my defense, I don’t think any of the Custer folks I’ve been hanging around know of this either.  Postclassical music is not really their thing.

NM, I have unfrozen my little-used admin powers to rescue your comment. No doubt the word “Holocaust” triggered the Godwin filter.

Dammit, Vance, now everyone sees that it wasn’t insightful.  (Thanks!)  Good thing I left out the anti-Ari jokes.
