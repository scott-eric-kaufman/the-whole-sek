I have been eaten  

by the squid  

that was in  

the icebox

and which  

was probably  

saving  

you for breakfast.

Forgive me  

it was so vicious  

so slimy  

and so cold.

well, aren’t you the nice one, scott. i’m as pleased as punch to see myself promoted from comments. someone stop me, or i’ll start thanking my co-stars, and never get off stage.

but seriously–it was kind of any obvious move. almost what you’d call  

low-hanging  

fruit.

I thought of making a plum/squid variant — but kb’s is much better than mine would have been, not least because it wouldn’t have occurred to me to make the biter bit.

And now that I remember, [here’s why](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010693.html) This is Just to Say came easily to mind for me too.

I chopped up the giant squid you were planning to live on all winter.  

I’m sorry, but I had a new knife and nothing else to cut  

And its massive tentacles were so inviting.

We laughed at the calamari together  

And then I sprayed them with ink.  

Forgive me. I simply do not know what I’m doing!

And I should add that the turn from eaten to been eaten, as Vance notes, is nothing short of brilliant.

No squid, but more interpretations in [this episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio\_Episode.aspx?sched=1239) at about the 51:00 mark.

We visited the aquarium and I shoved you in the tank.  

Forgive me. I was hungry  

and I wanted you underwater, where I am the cephalopod!

so much depends

a giant  

cephelapod

glazed with streaming

inside the sunken  

city.

I gave away the houseboat you were planning on living in after retirement.  

The squid who asked for it was giant  

And his sharp glinty beak was so firm and cold.

Over cuttlefish unleaving?

He eventually agreed to help,  

but only in exchange for calamari:  

squid pro quo.

when among squids my julia swims  

then, then (methinks) how close it trims  

by liquefaction of her limbs.	 

next, when i cast mine eyes and see  

that architeuthis each way free;  

oh how its tentacle taketh me!

. . . My cephalopodian love should grow  

Vaster than oceans, and more slow;  

An hundred years should go to praise  

Thine eyes and on thy tentacles gaze . . .
