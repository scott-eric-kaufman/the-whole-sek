interesting. i followed josh marshall’s link to see tweety railing about mccain’s contemptuous attitude towards obama, and the failure to look at him was a big part of the indictment.

i feel a bit like i’m watching the birth of a new ‘gore sighs’ moment, and i have mixed feelings about it.

on the one hand, i would be delighted to have the press turn on mccain and begin crafting a damning narrative. how lovely to be on the winning side this time!

on the the other hand, it makes me a bit queasy, at several levels. first, is it true? the ‘gore sighs’ narrative took two scraps of truth (yes, he sighed a few times, yes, there was much to despise and condescend to in bush’s performance), and magnified them out of all proportion to the rest of the debate.

not having watched either debate on tv, i do not know whether the eye contact issue is just as trivial as the sighing issue or not. my impression is that it took a fair bit of video editing and print repetition to make everyone believe that gore sighed too much. we’re already getting that kind of media reinforcement on the eye-contact issue.

second, if true, should it affect anyone’s vote? surely not in gore’s case; he was a better candidate in every respect, even if he had spent the whole debate addressing bush as “governor stupid fuck lame-brain”. (in fact, he really shoulda).  people should have voted for him because he was better qualified and right on the issues, not because he did or did not sigh too much.

so i worry that once again we are seeing the media focus on entirely irrelevant matters of style and personality and earth-tones when they are failing to do their job on issues and ideas.

fuck it. why worry about fair play? why reform the village’s systematically corrupt media practices right now, when they are finally working in my favor? i’m going to just roll with it.

that mccain–did you see how much trouble that fucker had looking at obama? he just creeps me out.

(as indeed he does.)

kb, I think the lack of eye contact is being used a placeholder for a larger point:  that the debate highlighted McCain’s overt contempt for Obama.  Put another way, I watched the whole thing (recovery time may be lengthy), and I did notice that McCain seemed to avoid looking at Obama.  But that only mattered insofar as McCain radiated real anger that he had to share a stage with his opponent.  Which just ties into a long-running McCain narrative:  that he’s an angry, dismissive — even mean — son of a bitch.

And so, the eye contact story strikes me as very similar to what happened with Gore’s sighs in 2000.  The dominant narrative then was that Gore was an aloof, condescending wonk, someone who fancied himself the smartest guy in the room, even when the room included some pretty smart guys.  And the sigh meme fit that narrative.

**kid bitzer**

					

		

yeah, but is the larger point in either case a really wise thing for an electorate to focus on? 

yeah, maybe gore was wonky and aloof and over-estimated his own intellect. but it still would have been far better for the country to elect him.

remember–the same judgment that led to “gore is too wonky” also led to “but george is a regular guy who i’d like to have a beer with and he’s also real bipartisan and will restore honor to the white house.”

problem is, we are lousy judges of character, and we wind up rewarding people who can lie with their bodies and faces as well as their words.

still, any stick to beat the devil.

**ari**

					

		

No, I certainly don’t think sighs or a dismissive mien are good reasons not to vote for a candidate.  I just think that’s how narrative works:  once it becomes entrenched, the purveyors of the narrative will find evidence to support what they’re peddling.  Gores’s sighs were fewer and further between than most people, after the fact, believed.  But the wonder of editing and steady repetition during a long news cycle made them ubiquitous.  McCain’s decision, if it was that, to avoid eye contact with Obama wasn’t that overwhelming last night.  But now, as the conventional wisdom ossifies, that will be the story we’ll hear.

sure, the electorate is not perfectly rational and isn’t going to be (ari’s grandmother aside).

but the rationality of political discourse is at least amenable to small improvements and degradations. it is better and worse in different countries and at different times.

i’d like it to be better.

here’s john cole:

“You can lament that this stuff should be all about the issues, or you can accept the reality that this sort of stuff killed Gore. Bob Somerby still is furious about it. At any rate, it was sighs and eye-rolling in 2000, but in 2008 it will be anger, contempt, and the refusal to make eye contact.”

**Colin**

					

		

The contempt extended into substance because McCain’s tactic was to convert \*any\* policy disagreement into an instance of Obama’s naivete.  The idea, presumably, was that if he refused to treat Obama as a peer, viewers would follow.  

This was more striking because (a) Lehrer noticed it and tried to get them to talk to each other early on, and (b) Obama did try to engage several times and specify points of agreement.  So you came away, perhaps, remembering that Obama was looking to agree when he could, and McCain was looking for any excuse to pull experience.

(Someone might look at the transcript for how they addressed each other — I remember Obama saying “John’s right” once or twice; I don’t remember similar courtesy on the other side.)

It may strike a few voters as odd that McC pulled experience so frequently and forcefully — I’ve been to Waziristan!  It’s lovely this time of year! — while his running mate must make recourse to the opposite argument.

**CharleyCarp**

					

		

I didn’t think the anger worked for him at all.  All the people who care about the substance have already lined up one way or the other.  What’s left are the people looking at a completely different narrative.  McCain can be mad that this naive, dangerous, inexperienced, underqualified guy is viewed as qualified for President, but then he’s totally undermined that by putting Gov. Palin on stage as ready to assume office as well. 

His own worst enemy.

**Ben Alpers**

					

		

I watched the debate on CNN.  The Independent and Democratic lines on their people meter (or whatever they call it) took a nosedive whenever McCain went into one of his contempt moments.

But this was clearly a well-honed (if not well-chosen) strategy.  This morning the McCain campaign unveiled its [first post-debate ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec3aC8ZJZTc), which shows three instances of Obama saying that McCain is “absolutely right” about something and then mocks Obama for doing so: “Is Barack Obama ready to lead?”

This is a pretty bizarre line of attack. Do leaders have to mechanically disagree with everything that their political opponents say?

At any rate, the mocking and contempt from McCain is clearly intentional and premeditated, which makes it a little different from Gore’s sighs.

Oops…I should have written that more clearly. I meant to point out that McCain’s ad seems to take Obama to task for not being more contemptuous of McCain, as if that is what leadership consists of.

kb: by not watching the debate on TV, you may have missed the all-important visual effect of Sen. McCain’s non-eye-contact posturing at the podium. Sen. Obama, on viewer’s right, usually kept his eyes straight ahead (at the camera), or turned half-right, to Jim Lehrer (in the center), or full-right (at. Sen. McCain). McCain, though, on viewer’s left,  also kept his eyes mostly turned to the right while speaking, which gave the effect of him talking into space, or away from the moderator: which was magnified by the typical split-screen shots of the candidates. Obama was mostly looking respectfully at the “audience”, or his opponent: McCain looked like he was talking to the air. Not the visuals you really want to display: and I think that the _visuals_ were what was really going to matter in this debate. Hence the “advantage: Obama” conclusion so many have reached.

**Colin**

					

		

To circle back to the Kid’s original point, my feeling last night was that McCain had done better.   In debating-points terms, he made more complete arguments and more unanswered critiques, and to my ear he was more at home in the issues.  He had a strong final wrapup.  Obama sometimes has trouble completing points.  He’ll set up a critique, and you can see where it’s going, but then he doesn’t drive it home.  

But if viewers are watching this with an eye to how people interact, yeah, it was quite different and the difference is maybe not unimportant.  McCain is the fragile patriarch — warm and generous when his authority is conceded, bitterly angry when not.  This is a guy famous for cursing out fellow Republican senators.  Obama is a conciliator.  And this is, for all the mockery of community organizing, part of the community organizer’s skill: you work out common ground, get people talking, and narrow differences where you can, because you \*can’t\* pull authority.

Sorry, I know we’re discussing visuals here, but the (eotaw-related!) thing I’m curious about is whether Obama is going to do anything with McCain’s freeze on spending proposal. That jumped out at me as Hooverish, or even beyond Hooverish. Neither candidate really addressed the magnitude of the economic crisis, and looming possible Depression, though I noticed that Obama did bring up Roosevelt. But when McCain said “freeze” I was thinking, has the man never heard the phrase “prime the pump”?

**Colin**

					

		

My read, ac, was that both refused to address the what-would-you-cut question directly, though McCain tried the old we’ll-have-to-scrutinize-every-agency line, and disingenuously suggested cutting foreign aid when he must know that the large outlays (ESF to Egypt, Israel, Pakistan …) are national-security spending.

Yes, if we’re facing the scale of financial panic and recession I think we are, the right answer is that we’re gonna spend like mad.  But you can’t say that.

kb, it certainly shouldn’t be important, but here’s the thing: [I stare at women’s breasts](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/two\_posts\_writt.html), so if _I_ notice McCain’s reluctance to make eye contact, I can only imagine what a normal person observed.

**[bitchphd](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com)**

					

		

My sense of it, and obviously I’m not impartial, is that McCain’s impatience and sense of outrage was less about Obama’s qualifications (especially since Obama was clearly smarter than McCain), and mostly just about his, McC’s, own sense of entitlement.  “I’m a veteran!  I love veterans!  How can anyone \*not\* vote for me?”  He seems angry that he has to run against anyone at all.

While body language shouldn’t determine everything, it was stunning that in 90 minutes, McCain may not have ever looked at Obama (not that I saw). Amazing.

Far more important was McCain’s frequent repetition of “Senator Obama doesn’t understand….” I wager Obama is capable of understanding anything McCain is capable of and, I believe, more. And, Obama is polite to someone who is rude to him.

_While body language shouldn’t determine everything, it was stunning that in 90 minutes, McCain may not have ever looked at Obama (not that I saw). Amazing._

There’s one moment as the two are shaking hands before the debate when Obama looks at McCain, who’s looking at the crowd, and then as Obama looks away McCain looks at Obama for a moment. When he fails to make eye contact he looks away. I haven’t seen another moment when he tries, though.

Plus, apparently I like the word “moment.”

Yeah, I dunno about Gore sighing, but this was really striking: it was more than “there you go again,” or impatience; it was, like, “I refuse to even really acknowledge your existence.”  watching the entire thing was actually more striking than the stills: he -really- didn’t look at the man -once.-

The sister who made the comment about John  McRacist ‘s  body language was dead on!  As a young black man  I  notice from life experiance  that if a white person (and I’m not saying all whites!)  harbor racist beliefs  it will manifest itself in terms  of body language which can denote attitudes.  ( While I don’t agree with everything  Obama stands for )  McRacist was totally disrespectful and rude to Obama  because here you have a 72 year old rich white man who came from a time when a black person  was considered ‘nothing’  and not worthy of simple  decent  courtesy . (Its  like  McRacist  was trying to show through body talk that he think Obama  should not be on the stage with him  trying to be CEO  of the USA   because its ‘a white man’s country’) What the hell else can you expect from a racist war criminal   who  helped mass murdered Vietnamese  workers in a genocidal war 40 years ago? ! The whole presidential debate was a lesson  in race and class. What do others think about what I just said?

i think the stuff about vietnam is maybe a little simplified.

but the stuff about mccain’s racism seems very, very plausible.

i also think there’s another element to this: obama knows that he can torpedo mccain by getting him riled up, by making mccain go ballistic, as he has the real possibility of doing. obama can be much more subtle in his digs, and he still knows that they rankle. (see the coverage of the white house bailout meeting, where obama put mccain on the spot by asking him point-blank, publicly, which plan he supported. mccain had nothing, folded, and stomped out of the meeting not long after.)

so part of what you’re seeing is mccain trying to keep himself from going ballistic. which i suspect obama is enjoying immensely. it works either way; it makes mccain into a tightly wound ball of fury, or he’ll eventually blow a gasket and say something really, really stupid. which will be even more fun.

but mostly i wanted to thank the earlier commenter who provided the link:

hey belledame: merci!
