## UC turf war: Beneath whose armpit dwells a ferocious goat?*

 * Tuesday, October 14, 2008

So I avoided [these duties](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/the-dismal-science-is-that-much-more-dismal-today/#comment-23348) today by defending what I’d written [yesterday](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/who-really-wrote-obamas-dreams-from-my-father/) from [this](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422).  I don’t know what to make of that—the anger spills from, well, I’m not sure—but in the end, I’m blamed for present hate-mail from [_Atlantic_ readers](http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/epic\_failayers\_ghostwrote\_obamas\_memoir.php) and future hate-mail from [_American Conservative_ readers](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-560702).  All because I considered Jeff Goldstein’s “disinterested” disquisition on the relationship of ghostwriters to their subjects insufficiently disinterested, what with it being a series of hypotheticals about Bill Ayers ghostwriting Barack Obama’s autobiographies and all.

Why would I think Goldstein’s interests weren’t disinterested?  Probably because he’s been postulating [this here](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13401) and [that there](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13395) about Ayers’ relation to Obama’s relation to Alinksy’s relation to the New Left and all things radical.  Admittedly, in the post I linked to—the disinterested “[What If…?](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/theory\_comics\_t.html)” about Ayers ghostwriting Obama’s memoirs—Jeff didn’t speak directly to his beliefs about Obama and the totalitarian state his victory will usher in.

He spoke entirely hypothetically and disinterestedly about the sort of material James Olney wrote brilliantly about in [_Memory & Narrative_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226628175/diesekoschmar-20)—a book I can’t recommend highly enough, for what it lacks in the faux-theoretical sophistication of insecure blowhards it makes up with genuine, old-school erudition—except unlike Olney, whose impetus was either [Beckett or St. Augustine](http://books.google.com/books?id=LhNmX63PJvsC&dq=%!j(MISSING)ames+olney%!+(MISSING)%!m(MISSING)emory+and+narrative%!&(MISSING)pg=PP1&ots=g4GXR5HE2W&sig=RLtuoqJfMz0PHRj8pc-wnJpBBb0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA1,M1), Jeff felt compelled to share his wholly and entirely disinterested thoughts about life-writing after reading Cashill’s hackneyed “[analysis](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=76731)” of Ayers and Obama’s memoirs.

What was I thinking, connecting what he’d been writing to months to his totally disinterested post about life-writing that just so happened to feature the same two figures who star in his drama of inevitable American decline?  [I’m such a liar](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-560707) . . . but if you can bear with me for a moment, there’s a more important topic at stake here.  Jeff’s commenters have sunk to a new low:

Now they’re claiming [UCI is a community college](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561038).  They’re making fun of the institution that made me a Doctor of Philosophy of Literature, and I won’t stand for it.  I’m this close to blowing all my gaskets and—

—what’s that you say?  UCI _isn’t_ the armpit of the UC system?  [_Davis_ is](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561073)?  I suppose my gaskets are safe then.  I can’t imagine anyone _here_ taking offense to _that_.

Christ, why is it that the one thing Goldstein apparently managed to learn in grad school was how to write the worst of academic prose?

Didn’t Goldstein tearfully retire from blogging earlier this year? To what do we owe the pleasure of his return?

I beg you to stop engaging with people like that, SEK.  How about this?  If you’ll agree to step away from the crazy, I’m willing to admit that Davis is an armpit (fingers crossed).  Okay?  Deal?

What Ari said, Scott. For your own health. And I too will stipulate that if UC has goats, they’re in Davis.

And Ari, what happened to that post that just flickered briefly across the front page? It made me curious about what’s-his-name’s anonymous design for that thing.

Scott, you need to take a solemn vow with me.  (Imagine that you and I hold hands.  Since we’ve never met, also imagine that I’m shockingly charismatic.)  Now swear, swear as if your eternal soul depended on it — _which it does_ — that you will ignore Jeff Goldstein.  Jeff more than anyone else in the right blogosphere thrives on the attention.  If you ignore him, he will shrivel up and die.  You must ignore him.  You must.

It went up right after this post did.  Which made me feel bad about stepping on Scott’s art.  So I changed the time stamp.  But then it was up before this post.  Which seemed dishonest.  So now it should post pretty soon.  I think.

Wow, that was a revealing comment thread.  I now know a) where you mange to attract/seduce your trolls (it’s almost cute; they hang out together spewing bile!), and b) that Obama is not a liberal hawk, like I thought, but apparently an actual socialist!  Now I’m **super** psyched for the election and the workers democracy that will surely follow it.

Seriously, please stop talking to these freakazoid mfs.  I know it livens up the day, but no good will come of it.  Read them? If you like. Parody them?  Sure, if it makes you happy. But don’t try and convince yourself that anything will come of a game of “No, I’m not” “Yes, you are.”

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

Lack of disinterest is the least of it.  Here’s the core of this according to Jeff G:

“If the charges are true, and Obama’s memoirs were in fact written by Bill Ayers, at least in part, than it is clear that at least in part, Barack Obama is a creation of Bill Ayers, not with respect to the historical events of Obama’s life, but with respect to how those events are presented, and how the presentation itself speaks to the “person” doing the presenting.

On that meta level, “Obama,” as we’ve come to know him through his memoirs, is more Ayers than he is Obama. Because from the perspective of “literariness” (if such a thing can be said to exist), the presentation is equally as important as the presented.”

The rest of it is one long equivocation between “Obama” and Obama, spiced with a bit of pretense that the presented Obama consists mostly of this book and not almost wholly of campaign material, interviews, and so on.

But the basic premise is … what?  Jeff G throws around words like “ontological”, but strangely enough, no other politician has ever before been defined by his ghostwriter.  When people find out that a politician used a ghostwriter, they assume that the book therefore tells you \*less\* about the politician, who has hidden behind a sort of screen, not more.  They don’t analyze the screen, which is assumed to present some sort of pleasant picture, as the key to the Real Truth about the pol, or even his image.

This goes beyond sloppiness or political interest, into laughable barking-mad incompetence.  Really, you’ve gone easy on Jeff G.

So should you engage with him further?  Don’t listen to ari or Vance or Walt or me, Scott.  [Listen to the wise Jpool!](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/who-really-wrote-obamas-dreams-from-my-father/#comment-23247) — who was so upset that I might chide you for getting involved in yet another pointless engagement with these people that he pre-emptively chided me because he imagined that I would get on your case about it.  (The reason I didn’t, by the way, is because your original post wasn’t full of proteinwisdom links.  It’s worth shooting down a new wingnut story that’s coming out their propaganda caves, where their stories are created, even though their bloggers are best ignored.)

Not that I think that the Jpools of the world will change their minds, no matter how often they are proven wrong.  But you don’t want to be one of them, do you, Scott?  I mean, look at your track record with this kind of engagement.

yeah, sek, you really should feel no obligation to engage with anything that pasty says, and some obligation to deprive him of attention.

he has proven, times beyond counting, that he is dishonest, stupid, and vicious.  i know the bar on polite company is set very low on the web, but he really has excluded himself from anything like polite company.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

Weicker was a maverick, Vance, so I assume that it was a forgivable partiality to family.

But seriously, my analysis, such as it is, is time-valued.  Respectable Republicans certainly existed at some times (although I’d still dispute whether conservatives ever did), but they don’t exist in 2008.  Anyone of Weicker’s stature would have left the party.

b,

I was not making a suggestion about the central valley, let alone community colleges (of which UC Merced is pretty obviously not one).

I have a problem with rage blackouts so I didn’t dare to read JG’s original post until the subsequent exchange made it irresistible.  How surprised I was to find out that his “theoretical analysis” was not a batshit-insane piece of wingnuttery at all but a perfectly logical application of the logical principle of conditionality wherein the governing “if…then” statement is “if some tangentially related thing is true of his running mate, then the postulated, though seemingly crazy, accusation must be true of the candidate himself,” to wit:

we already know that one member of the Obama/Biden ticket has a tendency toward plagiarism; so it would be no great leap to find out that the principal — in addition to having his political coming out launched by Bill Ayers, might have had help, also, shaping the narrative and story that has, since its publication in a pair of memoirs, created the public persona of “Barack Obama.”

How can anyone argue with this?  Clearly, the only way that progressives can combat such powerful arguments is to fight fire with fire.  

I propose that we find an amateur cosmologist who will help us to cobble together the evidence to support the implication that, since we already know that one member of the McCain/Palin ticket is a woman with a tendency toward the abuse of power, it is no great leap to assume that the principal is not in fact “John McCain” at all but a cunning disguise donned by a superintelligent space ghost from the future who has come to colonize the planet Earth and vanquish the human race by swallowing us all in the enormous intergalactic vagina dentata that it conceals beneath its rubbery prosthetic skin.

I’m pretty sure we can prove this scientifically if we can only find the right equipment and run some tests on John McCain’s alleged “body.”  Where do you think a person might be able to pick up a [PKE meter](http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Boulevard/7399/pke.html)?

Ari:

You’re right, it’s better to laugh at the inmates than interact with them at this point.  In an email exchange with one of the good eggs over there, he pointed out that what we’re seeing is genuine fear of the Hitchcockian sort over there, with what’s not seen about Obama being more terrifying than what is.  My reply:

_Yet there is quite a bit out there about him. He has well over a decade of legislative history between Illinois and the Senate, has written two memoirs, &c. I’d say there’s a lot more information about him out there than there was about Bush I (because of the CIA) or Bush II (for reasons I’m not entirely clear on). That said, I think conservatives are right to think that the brand doesn’t match what’s in the box, as they’ve recently witnessed this very betrayal in the form of Bush II. Compassionate conservative? Sign onto Kyoto? All those campaign gestures toward Reagan Democrats and being a moderate? It was complete and utter bullshit, and if I’d reaped the rewards of that, I’d suspect the other team would try and do the same._

They’re afraid that Obama will be to liberals what Bush was to conservatives—a crypto-moderate during the campaign, an unthinking partisan in the White House.  And they’re genuinely frightened of this, which is why they’re veering into Obama executed Vince Foster with one hand while fondling Marilyn Monroe with the other.  So yes, no more engagement and Catullus was talking about you guys.

(I won’t mention the fact that Jeff banned me after WordPress sent him an automatic trackback to this post, because then my non-engagement would look less principled.)

Walt:

Consider it done.

Rich:

_This goes beyond sloppiness or political interest, into laughable barking-mad incompetence. Really, you’ve gone easy on Jeff G._

I’ve left the war-boarder gloves in the closet in the interest of engagement, but you’re right—at this point, there’s nothing intellectual about the engagement.

**Rich Puchalsky**

					

		

Well, I have to say that at the level of honest intellectual engagement, I still think that he got off easy.  Leaving aside all of the risible stuff about the putative indications that Ayers wrote the book, the idea that the ghostwriter of a politician’s early memoir has “created” the politician — has somehow fixed his image in stone, and then, through some sympathetic magic, controlled his decisions — is nonsensical.  But it appears to be of a piece with the kind of strong authorial intention that Jeff G is always going on about.  The main problem isn’t even his sloppiness or political interest.  The main problem is that his central ideas always made him incompetent at literary theory or criticism.

I don’t buy this.  They’re gearing up to treat Obama exactly the same way they treated Clinton for eight years….which was, of course, long before the wingnut variation of Bush Derangement Syndrome that your interlocutor was proposing as an explanation for their behavior toward Obama.

 _They’re gearing up to treat Obama exactly the same way they treated Clinton for eight years_

Politics is the continuation of war by other means.
