**[THE ORACLE] (http://chronicle.com/news/article/5476/california-universities-join-preparation-for-tomorrows-earthquake)**

At 10 a.m. Pacific time, emergency sirens will blare across Southern California and millions of residents will dive for cover, as part of an [earthquake simulation](http://www.shakeout.org/) that will involve close to a [dozen colleges and universities.](http://www.shakeout.org/media/venue\_list.php) The University of California, will be staging events at its [Irvine,](http://www.uci.edu/features/feature\_shakeout\_081106.php) [Los Angeles,](http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2008/nov/12/shakeout/) [Riverside,](http://newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1965) and [San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/portal/site/Libraries/menuitem.346352c02aac0c82b9ba4310d34b01ca/?vgnextoid=67010de6ea12d110VgnVCM100000c7b410acRCRD) campuses.

**SEK**

I understand, Great Wise One.  I will prepare my students for the blaring sirens.  They will learn to duck and protect their important bits.

_SEK enters the classroom at 9:30 a.m._

**SEK**

You are in grave danger!   At precisely 10:00 a.m. this campus will be struck by an earthquake of unprecedented proportions!   Sirens will blare and you will panic and die!

**STUDENT #1**

But we are too young to—

**STUDENT #2**

Too pretty to—

**SEK**

Fear not!  I will save you with techniques!  When sirens they do blare you are to duck!  When you have ducked you are to cover!  When you are covered your are to pray!****

**STUDENTS**

We are to pray.

**SEK** 

It is only 9:30.  On with the class!  Blah blah blah blah—

**STUDENT #3**

Point!

**SEK**

Excellent point!  Blah blah blah blah blah—

**STUDENT #4**

Point!

**SEK**

Another excellent point!  Let me illustrate it on the podium computer!  First I will turn off the lights with the computer because there are no light switches in the room.  We are in good darkness now.  Look at this point blah blah blah blah blah blah—

**STUDENT #5**

Scott!  It is time for the earthquake!

**SEK**

It is!  Let me see what to do!

_SEK peers down at the podium computer._ _There is a message on it._

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!  Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

We missed the earthquake!  Let us now resume the learning!  I will turn on the lights with the podium computer!

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!  Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

I will now turn on the lights!

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!   Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

We will learn in the dark for now.  Blah blah blah blah blah—

**STUDENT #2**

Point!

**SEK**

That is a point worth thinking about.  We should revisit that scene.  I will play it again for you so you can analyze it.  I am pressing the play button on the podium computer now.

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!  Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

We will continue to learn in the dark for now.  Blah blah blah blah blah—  

**  

STUDENT #3**

Point!

**SEK**

Another excellent point!  I will attempt for the second time to play a scene for you so you can analyze it.  Again I am pressing the play button on the podium computer.  

**  

PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!  Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

I am in great distress.  I cannot show you the scene and must teach in the dark.  All the computer will do is wish me an excellent day.  I will press it again.

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!      Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

Again!

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!  Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

Again!

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

BEEP!  Thank you for participating in the Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008.  We hope you and your students learned about shaking from it.  Have an excellent day!

**SEK**

I am defeated.  I have pressed all the buttons.  They all do not work.  Maybe one of you can figure this out?

**STUDENT WITH MAGIC FINGER**

Let me try.  I am pressing now the button with my finger.

**PODIUM COMPUTER**

Your wish is my command.

**STUDENT WITH MAGIC FINGER**

Bonus points?

**SEK**

Bonus points.

I believe you have a boldy tag that is infecting the rest of the site. Or are you just adding verisimilitude?

We can’t get the [more] tag to work either.  Obviously Scott does not have the magic fingers.

Now the bold is gone. It is a timid, cautious age.

He has not the magic fingers but he can beat bold tags into submission.

That is hysterical…for me.

What is it about SEK?  He seems to live a life of excitement and adventure without ever leaving the confines of academia.

it’s not every day that someone can have an earthquake drill not happen, AND the computer go berzerk.  your students will remember this class.

So true.  And Aristophanes couldn’t report them better.

**John  Emerson**

					

		

I do not believe that these things have all really happened to SEK, if such a person as SEK actually indeed does exist. He may well be the Stephen Glass of the internet. If he exists.

**[bitchphd](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com)**

					

		

Why is it that this tech shit \*never\* works for the instructor?  Seriously.  As a student, I frequently fixed tech problems for teachers and professors.  As a professor, I always have to ask a student to do it.  It’s like the magic law of the classroom.

**urbino**

					

		

Maybe.  I don’t know the ages of most of the people here, but SEK certainly doesn’t _seem_ old enough to have lost touch with current technology.  And he blogs.

**[bitchphd](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com)**

					

		

I don’t think it’s age.  I think it’s some kind of weird deer-in-headlights, absent-minded-professor thing, where when you’re standing in front of an audience you’re necessarily too audience-aware to really focus on the tech crap.

So there.

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

B, I’m decidedly older than either you or Scott — my joke may have misfired, but it wasn’t mean-spirited. (I’m also inept with gadgets, despite working in Silicon Valley.) Your analysis seems right.

Or maybe mine did.

Whatever the case may be, I thought you were a youngster, too, Vance.

I had you pegged as younger, but you still qualify as young.  Or I hope you do, since I’m the same age.

**[Linkmeister](http://www.linkmeister.com/blog/)**

					

		

That dialogue reminded me of [_Adventure_](http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/).

“You are in a twisty maze of passageways, all alike…”

**[SEK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)**

					

		

Linkmeister, there’s a [real good reason for that](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html).

kathy, the thing is, the message UC admin beamed my computer is what locked it up.  It’s not a coincidence, really, just a total breakdown by someone in some technical department who didn’t realize whatever override button they’d pressed would override my podium under MAGIC FINGERS touched it.  (Dr. B.’s wrong, then.  It’s not deer-in-headlights, really, more like pure incompetence.)

Brad, I assure you, there was nothing that exciting about this.  All the links are up there, I just happened to have a fake earthquake crash my podium computer . . . the one that controls the lights.  Because now that we’re in the future, we don’t need light switches!

Emerson, admittedly, you’ve seen more of this insanity than most—some threads, they die and don’t come back—but, um, next year at UnfoggedCon!

(And dudes!  I’m barely in my 30s!  Don’t you go aging me!)

My mental picture was of Metropolis, what with the robots; but the Adventure thing is right on (although we of a certain age might have said Zork).

Reboot.  

Or bring your own computer.  Although you may still have to reboot even with your own computer, just to get the gd overhead projector to switch back on once you’ve blanked the screen.

And of course you will not have the proper cords the first two times you try to use your own computer.

Don’t even get me started on temperature control.

That is not “decidedly older” than me.  Nor is it in fact “older” by the standards of anyone past elementary school.  I’ll be 41 in January.

And you \*were too\* being mean-spirited.  Us old people know these things.
