At 10 a.m. Pacific time, emergency sirens will blare across Southern California and millions of residents will dive for cover, as part of an [earthquake simulation](http://www.shakeout.org/) that will involve close to a [dozen colleges and universities.](http://www.shakeout.org/media/venue\_list.php) The University of California, will be staging events at its [Irvine,](http://www.uci.edu/features/feature\_shakeout\_081106.php) [Los Angeles,](http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2008/nov/12/shakeout/) [Riverside,](http://newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1965) and [San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/portal/site/Libraries/menuitem.346352c02aac0c82b9ba4310d34b01ca/?vgnextoid=67010de6ea12d110VgnVCM100000c7b410acRCRD) campuses.

**SEK**

I understand, Great Wise One.  I will prepare my students for the blaring sirens.  They will learn to duck and protect their important bits.

_SEK enters the classroom at 9:30 a.m._

**SEK**

You are in grave danger!   At precisely 10:00 a.m. this campus will be struck by an earthquake of unprecedented proportions!   Sirens will blare and you will panic and die!

**STUDENT #1**

**STUDENT #2**

Too pretty to—

**SEK**

Fear not!  I will save you with techniques!  When sirens they do blare you are to duck!  When you have ducked you are to cover!  When you are covered your are to pray!****

**STUDENTS**

We are to pray.

**SEK** 

It is only 9:30.  On with the class!  Blah blah blah blah—

**STUDENT #3**

**SEK**

Excellent point!  Blah blah blah blah blah—

**STUDENT #4**
