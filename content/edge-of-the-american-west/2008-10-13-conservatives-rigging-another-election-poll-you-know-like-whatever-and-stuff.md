[Conservatives](http://www.patterico.com/2008/10/12/pbs-poll-on-palins-qualifications/) are trying to use the power of internet polldom to convince the American people that Sarah Palin is fit to be President, but I’m not sure:

I mean _I’m voting for Not Sure_.  That’s what you know that I mean, you know?\*\*

I mean, shit, I know shit’s bad right now.  With all that starving bullshit, and the dust storms, and we running out of french fries and burrito coverings, but there’s a _solution_.  A three-point plan to fix everything:

**Number 1:** We’ve got this guy Not Sure.

**Number 2:** He’s got a higher IQ than _any man alive_.

**Number 3:** He’s going to fix _everything_—and he’s so smart, he’s gonna do it all _in one week_.

Seriously:


VOTE NOT SURE 2008!

(And in that poll, you know, for whatever and stuff.)

I voted in that poll a couple of dozen times a few weeks ago, when “yes” was leading by a half dozen points. This time, I was told “subsequent votes won’t count” after I voted once. It’s true that there was some viral marketing on the left on that, but there’s no bleeping way Palin _leads_ that poll without some major league poll-jamming on the right.

I feel a little guilty about voting “no”: technically, she _is_ qualified, as a natural-born US citizen above the age of 35.
