The [comments](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/farlio/5744657638484919703/) on [Farley’s post](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/02/aye.html) about grade inflation and student effort had convinced me not to read [the __ article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/education/18college.html) that inspired them.  Then [Shahar excerpted](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/student-entitlement/) a different part of the article and I changed my mind:

A recent study by researchers _at the University of California, Irvine_, found that a third of students surveyed said that they expected B’s just for attending lectures, and 40 percent said they deserved a B for completing the required reading.

Did that prepositional phrase modify the researchers (they are _at_ UCI) or where they did their study (_at_ UCI)?  I couldn’t tell from the excerpt.  So I read the article.  It didn’t say.  So I read the study it cited.  It didn’t say outright—but _it hinted_.  The ethnic diversity of its sample breaks down like this:

51.2%!
(MISSING)
East or Southeast Asian

18.9%!
(MISSING)
Caucasian

10.7%!
(MISSING)
Latino

1.1%!
(MISSING)
African American

The ethnic diversity of a [closely related fine public university in a similar location](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/about/) breaks down like this:

51%!
(MISSING)
Asian / Pacific Islander

24%!
(MISSING)
White

12%!
(MISSING)
Latino

2%!
(MISSING)
African American

Participants in the study were recruited through handbills “posted at the Social Sciences Human Subjects Laboratory.”  [Where do I teach](http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/SSL162.html)?  This means that [while](http://www.metafilter.com/79283/Is-it-time-to-move-beyond-grades) [everyone](http://joannejacobs.com/2009/02/19/great-expectations/) [else](http://chrisblattman.blogspot.com/2009/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-bs.html) can speak hypothetically about whether their students resemble those in the study, I must come to terms with the fact that sixty-percent of _**actual students actually sitting in my actual classes**_ believe that if they “explain to [_me_] that [they are] trying hard, [they] think [_I_] should give [them] some consideration with respect to [their] course grade.”  I must accept that fifty-percent of them **__** believe that they deserve a B if they “have completed most [_of the mandatory_] reading for [_my_] class” or “have attended most [_of the mandatory_] classes for [_my_] course.”  I must deal with the fact that twenty-five percent of them “would think poorly of [_me if I_] didn’t respond the same day to an e-mail [they] sent.”

I could learn to deal with that.  But I’m not sure I can live in a world in which _sixteen-percent_ **** of my students think that I “should not be annoyed with [them] if [they] receive an important call during class.”

no, but, like, it’s a _really_ important call and stuff.

_But I’m not sure I can live in a world in which sixteen-percent of my students think that I “should not be annoyed with [them] if [they] receive an important call during class.”_

I teach at community college, so the world is a bit different, but I’m with you. I tell my students that they’re welcome to take whatever phone call they deem important, but they need to leave the room to do it. And they might as well take their belongings with them, because the initial interruption is more than enough, and I won’t be happy to see them creep back into class. Either the call is important enough that they need to leave anyway, or they’ve answered a call that wasn’t that important. It’s up to them to let their friends/families/etc. know that they can’t be interrupted in class.

I rarely have problems once I’ve talked with the students.

I’ve got to side with your students on this one. On any given evening, they could be out getting high or having sex – enjoying their youth. If, instead, they spend the time stuck in their dorm rooms doing _your_ required reading, the least they ought to expect in return is that you cut them some slack when the grades come around.

I wasn’t aware that we were forcing either the students or their parents to spend their youth and thousands of dollars coming to our classes.  This is voluntary, after all.

Does UCI have some kind of First-Year acculturation program? University 101, First Year Seminar, Freshman Experience, etc., are specifically intended to disabuse students of the idea that they’re still in high school. Not that they work all that well: every school I’ve ever taught at (full time) has something like it, and my students still can’t figure out that you’re supposed to read the textbook, listen to the lectures, _think_ about the material, and come up with something greater than (or at _least_ equal to) the sum of the parts.

Excuse me, I have to go grade now.

**[Spike](http://8ball.tridelphia.net)**

					

		

I was being tongue in cheek, although not entirely so. Students aren’t “forced” to spend their youth and money going to your classes. On the other hand, _not_ going to college has some pretty significant negative consequences on one’s career and eventual standard of living. So its not like coercion is totally absent.

I think that professors should recognize that required reading is often tedious and superfluous – at least when seen from the student’s perspective. For a student to dedicate their limited time to what they would see as unnecessary reading, instead of following other, more tempting, pursuits, is indeed a sacrifice that should have some reward. 

Depending on the amount of reading required, I don’t think its too much to expect that a B would be handed out on that basis. Not an, A, certainly. But I don’t see any particular reason to be stingy with the Bs.

_Depending on the amount of reading required, I don’t think its too much to expect that a B would be handed out on that basis._

You know, now that I’ve thought about it, you have a point.  Doing the reading \*should\* get you that B.  How about if we make a bit finer-grained, though?  Rather than just a “B” and an “A”, we have “B-“, “B”, “B+” and “A-,” “A”, and “A+”.  That allows us to differentiate between people who skim the reading right before class and those who really engage with it.

Actually, as I think about it further, how about if we give them slightly different labels?  Just to be clear on what is what.  A “B-” could be labeled an “F”, a “B” would be a “D”, a “B+” would be a “C” and so on. 

There you go:  everybody who does the reading gets a “B” if with slightly different labels.

Yeah, but if you give people Fs, that screws with scholarship’s, grade point averages, all that. That’s fine for people who don’t do put any effort into it, but people who do put the effort in don’t deserve to be treated like that. Your class isn’t _that_ important.

**kid bitzer**

					

		

i certainly agree that \*i\* am not that important.

but i think that the things i teach are important. and i think the degree that my university confers is important. and i think that the things my students will do later in life, which they will do well or badly in part because of what they learn here, are all important.

i don’t grade as a reflection of my vanity. it’s not all about me. but that doesn’t mean it’s all a joke, either.

A former colleague of mine once told a student he was getting an F because that’s the lowest he was allowed to go on the alphabet.  “I’d give you a G if I could.”

Wow. I thought I was incredibly sympathetic to students, and I fully recognize that my class is not _that_ important – but really?

There is a big difference between putting effort in and doing something well. I would argue that this is not a bad lesson for students to learn.

I think that’s what Cs are for. I would actually agree that B is on the generous side – although it might be appropriate depending on the quantity of effort we are talking about here.

What, you mean that performance, or lack thereof, actually has consequences?  Shocking.

That’s exactly what an “F” means, and, yes, my class \*is\* important, just as is \*every\* class in college.

I don’t give the first flying shit whether my students think my readings are either tedious or superfluous. In fact, the student’s perspective is exactly what we’re trying to change–because it’s full of shit, generally.

Okay, I officially hate humanity again.

**[Spike](http://8ball.tridelphia.net)**

					

		

_So in your mind, everyone is above average?_

Certainly not. Presumably the subset of students who did do the required reading would be higher performers than the average of the class as a whole. So not everyone would be above average, but the readers would be.

Also, I’m not buying your implication that C is average. Not in this day and age. B is the new C.

**[Jason B.](http://notnotnegative.blogspot.com)**

					

		

How is B the new C? Because there’s pressure for people to get higher grades? C is acceptable. C is average. That’s what C is, in a system that recognizes grades from A to F.

If B is your C you fail. You are a failure as an educator. You’re coddling.

_If B is your C you fail. You are a failure as an educator. You’re coddling._

That’s probably why I’m not an educator. But as a former average student, I can tell you I got a lot more Bs than Cs. And that was without doing a whole lot of the required reading.

C is the Platonic average grade. B is the grade that actual average students generally get.

Spike-

Your teachers failed you. I’m sorry. You don’t deserve your B grades, and you probably don’t deserve 10%!o(MISSING)f your current income. Give it back.

More seriously–if you were able to skate by with minimal effort, consider yourself lucky for winning the genetic/experiential lottery prior to getting to college. Kudos. But don’t imagine that should be the model for grading across the board.

Your averages smell like they’ve been pulled from your ass.

I remember one of my professors fielding a question about why we had to do this boring and irrelevant reading. He said that “boring” was a judgment we could make at any time, but “irrelevant” was one we wouldn’t be qualified to apply until after the course. The point, after all, was that we came in not knowing things. After we knew them, then we’d be in a position to see how they fit together, or didn’t.

_The Rolling Stones recorded a song called “Off the Hook.” Does this mean they’re no longer groovy?_

You have to take into account the context of the times.  It’s cool for the Stones in 1965, but if Nixon had referred to something as  “off the hook,” that would have been extremely un-cool, because he would have been referring to a phone he was having tapped.

Who else on this thread, besides kid b and me, is old enough to remember [Nixon on Laugh-In](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCp8Edp4pfo)? Definitely un-cool.

As a current history undergraduate in a California State University who actually does read the material, comes to class, and attempts to think and write coherently, I have zero respect for the argument that people should be handed some sort of complimentary B or C because they manage to wander into class.  They should get the grade they earn.  If that’s an F, so be it.  Why anyone would contemplate coddling students who don’t read the material, don’t participate in the class discussion, write  incoherent essays, and have such a sense of entitlement that they believe they should get a B grade just because is beyond me.  Please pardon my language when I say this, but fuck them.  I earn by A’s and B’s.  They can too with a little effort.  

Yes the material is often tedious, difficult, and lengthy.  Too bad.  Go run off to the business department if you want to not have to write long papers on historical topics.  I am constantly amused by the business majors who take an upper division history class and realize that they will have to write more than a few paragraphs and read books written by historicans rather than Donald Trump or disgraced Wall Street executives.  The look of horror on their faces is enormously funny.  The ones that actually slog through don’t regret though.  

The history professors in my department are a tolerant bunch for the most part, and genuinely care about their students learning something.  But they are too nice.  If they don’t come to class or read the material, flunk them.  As somone who also has a full time corporate job, I can tell you their employers will not be so tolerant.

pf, that was one tightly-packed time-capsule of cringe you just unloaded on us there.  i mean, yeah, i remembered it in the sense that i was deeply aware of it when it happened.

but i had forgotten it, in the sense that it had not tormented me in decades. and it could have stayed forgotten till my death.

why did you do that to us? 

so i had already sorted out that ‘off the hook’ was risible because it had fallen from the back platform of the ever-moving train of coolness, was running to catch up, and kept frantically lunging and missing its handhold.

i was just wondering whether there was some determinate event or personality that had brought the phrase into its original prominence. (as, e.g. “sock it to me” had laugh-in, but “groovy” just emerged without any one determinate origin.)

How do we square poll results like these with study results like [these](http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/02.28/12-grades.html):

“Even though the assessment included many open-ended essay questions,” said Sadler, “students quickly learned to award grades with an accuracy that rivaled their teacher. Despite the opportunity for embellishing one’s own grade, students still graded their own tests more accurately than the tests of their classmates. Only students on the lower end of the performance scale tended to inflate their own scores when grading themselves.”

Be interesting to see how close the results matched.

(Our student evaluation forms have a “What grade do you think you’re getting?” question and the students report reasonably accurately \*except\* there are far fewer Cs, Ds, and Fs than there end up being.  That echoes the study’s conclusion.)

A colleague of mine commented the other day on the displeasure of letting people down with poor grades and crushing their dreams. I have to admit I’m hardhearted enough to not really relate to this; I responded that they have to find out sometime (that they might not be cut out for this whole reading, writing, and analytical thinking thing) or else they’d all go to Grad school. (Not really, of course, they’d all have to be crazy in addition to clueless, but you get the point). 

Of course, even if I’m incredibly cynical about the ability of the majority of Americans to think analytically, obviously anyone involved in education believes that there is untapped potential in most if not all students to teach them this skill. Otherwise we would really hate our jobs and have no reason to keep on with it. However, this hope runs up against the reality that almost no one goes to college anymore “to learn”, either sheer information or analytical skills. They go because that’s their ticket to middle class comfort. And that makes enough sense and I can’t hold it against them, really.

But I completely disagree that therefore, we should readjust the meaning of grades and inflate everyone to a B unless they really suck it. They might be taking our classes for whatever reasons they have, but we’re teaching and grading them on the basis of how successful they are at learning those skills. If everyone stopped considering their students’ lives or expectations as an appropriate barometer for what they should assign or how they should grade, we would get the appropriate grade deflation. 

And perhaps I’m completely wrong or off base about this, but it seems to me this would increase the respect towards the task at hand — too many students don’t believe there is anything special towards the annoying phrase they always hear out of instructor’s mouths, “analysis” and the idea of a C as a common grade is an affront to the American belief that everyone is more or less as smart as the next as long as they just “try hard enough.” But if it was generally understood that this is hard stuff, that requires considerable effort and skill, I wonder if it would be more difficult for the culture in general to just write off the scholarly and analytical in their society as somehow merely self-satisfied eggheads. Or, to be more succinct, it does not seem that being easy on people is a way to engender respect or admiration for the task at hand; it makes it seem flippant and the instructors easy to hookwink, as is well testified to by these students who believe they \*deserve\* Bs merely because they’ve done “most of the reading.”

This post and the most excellent comments thread that accompanies it led me to link to it on my own class blog and rant a bit: [http://preview.tinyurl.com/cvw4ch](http://preview.tinyurl.com/cvw4ch)

I’m firmly in the “you-get-what-you-earn” camp. 

No, every class in college isn’t “important,” in the sense that it makes a measurable difference in your life.  I took Basket Weaving 101 as an undergrad.  But that doesn’t mean I blew BW101 off and got a D in it, either. If the class isn’t important, take it Pass/Fail.

At UCLA no small number of students considers an A- to be the functional equivalent of an F.  With a B they come around the next quarter asking to file retroactive drop forms.

To deal with it, I simply put a grade change policy in all of my syllabi, stating very clearly that I am absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to change students’ grades.

To get a grade changed, all I ask is that the student write a 300-word essay clearly and specifically illustrating the important points or conclusions I overlooked, highlighting the uniqueness of her/his findings, the quality of the quantitative analysis, and so forth, single-spaced in Times New Roman 12 with 1-inch margins and no spelling or grammatical errors.

Once that fine piece of literature has been submitted, I go on, the T.A. and I will review the work and reconsider our grades —  reserving the right to lower the grade if we find that, for reasons of fatigue or distraction, we were too generous the first time around.

And that’s usually the end of that.

_If they don’t come to class or read the material, flunk them. As somone who also has a full time corporate job, I can tell you their employers will not be so tolerant._

First class I TAed for, ages ago, had a policy for late papers.  Every day late, the grade would be lowered a third of a letter grade.  Standard stuff, and clearly stated on the syllabus.

This student turned in his paper five days late, was docked one and two-thirds a letter grade as a result (would have been a B+, he got a C-), and then went ballistic.  He emailed his TA (not me) and said, “I don’t understand this academic obsession with deadlines.  Deadlines don’t matter in the real world.”

His thirtysomething TA left aside the hilarity of a 19-year-old kid lecturing him about “the real world,” and proceeded to point out, “In the real world, turning in an assignment five days late doesn’t get you a C-, it gets you fired.”

Not only don’t they require them, they don’t encourage them, either. Actually, most of us have never heard of them. Thus the wheel reinvention.

I do sometimes use a self-assessment exercise that covers some of the same ground — what’s your thesis, your strongest evidence, your main weakness, what would you improve if you had time, etc. — but I would never ask students to grade their own work (or suggest a grade to me) until they had some facility with the [rubrics I use](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/GradingPapers.html). I will use the self-assessment as a basis for evaluating their _revisions_ sometimes: whether they perceived and addressed the same issues I did, that sort of thing.

“a third of students surveyed said that they expected B’s just for attending lectures, and 40 percent said they deserved a B for completing the required reading.”

We don’t know how the survey was worded, but it should be obvious that “expected” and “deserved” are entirely different concepts.  I “expect” something based on past experience.  If I have been able to get B’s just by attending lectures, then I will “expect” to continue to get B’s just by attending lectures.  It has nothing to do with what I think I “deserve.”  It has to do with my experience of how my professors grade.

“Deserve” is a different concept.  And the 40%!w(MISSING)ho think they “deserve” a B for doing the reading are not saying that they think they should get a “B” if they turn in an affidavit that says, “I swear that I have done the reading.”  They are saying that they believe that if they do the reading (and presumably take the tests and write the papers) the work they submit will be deserving of at least a “B.”  This is utterly unremarkable.  Don’t we all believe that 40%!o(MISSING)f the students in any class should earn either an A or a B?  Don’t we all think that the A and B students know who they are?  And what more do we expect of them than to do the reading, write the papers, and take the tests?

@Bloix: To think about what they read, and have the results of that thought reflected in the papers and test.

Nevertheless, you have a point; people who regularly do the work and get good grades will probably both expect good grades, and think they deserve them; and there’s a significant proportion of such people.

It seems to me, though, that if administrators want to collect tuition from a large number of people who don’t want to learn any class subject matter, then they need to design a more learning-optional diploma mill curriculum (or perhaps it would be more accurate to say pseudo-curriculum).  If employers are trying to rely on grades to separate the wheat from the chaff, but the chaff pays just as much tuition and has a strong personal interest in not being separated, you have a problem.

People sometimes say such-and-such institution should be ashamed to have graduated John Yoo, or Jonah Goldberg, or Amity Shlaes, or whoever has made a conspicuous fool of him/herself this week; but as far as I know, the institutions never actually \*are\* ashamed, and there’s no real consequences if they graduate conspicuous fools or pseudoscientists or wingnuts or even torture advocates.

P.S. Regarding the email question, if you construe “within the same day” as “within 24 hours”, and if the email indicates that the issue is time-sensitive, I would think it would be nice to see at least a brief response, barring extraordinary circumstances (in which, ideally, your email account could be set to robo-respond explaining why you can’t respond to email right now, although I understand not all systems may have that capability).  Although weekends might reasonably be an exception.

Obviously, sending an email at 11:55 and expecting a response before midnight (the \*literal\* same day) is ridiculous, and I don’t know what kind of qualifications were built (or read) into the original question.  But some amount of outside-class responsiveness clearly goes with the territory.

Chris, all I meant was that, if you ask a solid “B” student the following question, she will say very properly say “yes”:

“If you do the reading, submit the papers, and take the tests, do you deserve a “B”?”

If she gives less effort (if she blows off an elective, say), she’ll get a C and she won’t complain about it.  I don’t find these results surprising.

Perhaps the study asked the question differently.  But I read the article and there was a real “kids these days” attitude to it.

I think I’m inclined to agree with Bloix.  That is, I could see the students understanding the problem thus:  if I put in the effort and do the readings, I would expect that the resulting work would get me a B.  That’s not the same as “I deserve a B just for trying.”  And they seem to be testing for the “expect” claim and asserting the “entitlement claim.”

_Academe_ had a good [article](http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2009/JF/Feat/sull.htm) on how to know, as a hs student, if you’re prepared for college.  My favorite bit was on reading: “If you don’t like to read, you’re going to find college very difficult.”  Such simple, yet profound advice.  Until textbooks are written in manga format, that is.

With specific regard to grades, though, my opinion is that hell hath no fury like that of the B+ student.

_Not only don’t they require them, they don’t encourage them, either. Actually, most of us have never heard of them. Thus the wheel reinvention._

It’s just such a part of my teaching strategies I suppose I forgot my undergrad years—I wrote history papers and never turned in memos.  (I never took a composition class, so I don’t know if they did them there.)  (And by “never took” I mean “tested out of a class that I should’ve taken but didn’t and then only learned how to write well when forced to teach a composition class.”)  My writer’s memos ask students directed questions that refer to the rubric.  I’m not on my home computer, but they look approximately like this:

The rubric states that a solid transition does X.  Does yours do X?  If not, please explain why.

Getting them to evaluate their own work like that is a cheap way to compel them to internalize the values and standards reflected on the rubric.

_With specific regard to grades, though, my opinion is that hell hath no fury like that of the B+ student._

Honestly, this is the only time I take effort into account.  If I have a student who busted ass all quarter—all posts on time, valuable comments on peers’ work, attended office hours—and they’ve earned a grade in the B+ range, I bump it up to an A-.  Reason being they have learned the skills required to earn an A, they just didn’t know them when they began the course.  If they had, they wouldn’t have needed to take it.  So hard work and an upward trajectory—C+ on the first paper, B on the second, A on the third—will pay off in my class.

you got me, pf. i’m actually a nubile teeny-bopper.

what you say is strangely illuminating. i had never connected goldie hawn’s use of ‘sock it to me’ with aretha’s use.  

wikipedia opines:

“”Sock it to me!” experienced its greatest exposure on Laugh-In although the phrase had been featured in songs like Aretha Franklin’s 1967 “Respect” and Mitch Ryder’s 1966 “Sock It To Me, Baby!””

I’m a heretic: I like Otis Redding’s original “Respect” about a billion times more than I like Aretha’s screeching cover.

No guarantee on the quality of response, but urban dictionary has some interesting suggestions for “off the hook”: [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=off+the+hook](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=off+the+hook)

“And now, folks, it’s Sock It To Me time!” was a line from the Magistrates’ song, “Here Come the Judge,” perhaps the most facetious version of the song to appear on the charts in 1968.  The line was spoken by Jean Hillary, a Judy Carne soundalike.   Richard Nixon is probably the only person on “Laugh-In” to end the phrase with a question mark.  

I deserve at least a B for recalling all of this with no help from Wikipedia, and just a little help from Joel Whitburn.

From the Department of Now That’s What I’m Talking About, I give you Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, [on what grade he would give TARP 1 (the first $350 billion)](http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/publicoffering/post?&top.title=Stiglitz+on+the+Economy%!A(MISSING)+Too+Little%!C(MISSING)+Too+Late+%!b(MISSING)ut+Better+Than+Nothing%!&(MISSING)main.id=63214&main.ctrl=contentmgr.list&main.view=bloga.detail):

It gets an F or F–, depending on your grading structure.
