## Where I am, I don’t know, I’ll never know, in the silence you don’t know, you must go on, I can’t go on[.]

The [comments](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/farlio/5744657638484919703/) on [Farley’s post](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/02/aye.html) about grade inflation and student effort had convinced me not to read [the __ article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/education/18college.html) that inspired them.  Then [Shahar excerpted](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/student-entitlement/) a different part of the article and I changed my mind:

A recent study by researchers _at the University of California, Irvine_, found that a third of students surveyed said that they expected B’s just for attending lectures, and 40 percent said they deserved a B for completing the required reading.

Did that prepositional phrase modify the researchers (they are _at_ UCI) or where they did their study (_at_ UCI)?  I couldn’t tell from the excerpt.  So I read the article.  It didn’t say.  So I read the study it cited.  It didn’t say outright—but _it hinted_.  The ethnic diversity of its sample breaks down like this:

51.2%!
(MISSING)
East or Southeast Asian

18.9%!
(MISSING)
Caucasian

10.7%!
(MISSING)
Latino

1.1%!
(MISSING)
African American

The ethnic diversity of a [closely related fine public university in a similar location](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/about/) breaks down like this:

51%!
(MISSING)
Asian / Pacific Islander

24%!
(MISSING)
White

12%!
(MISSING)
Latino

2%!
(MISSING)
African American

Participants in the study were recruited through handbills “posted at the Social Sciences Human Subjects Laboratory.”  [Where do I teach](http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/SSL162.html)?  This means that [while](http://www.metafilter.com/79283/Is-it-time-to-move-beyond-grades) [everyone](http://joannejacobs.com/2009/02/19/great-expectations/) [else](http://chrisblattman.blogspot.com/2009/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-bs.html) can speak hypothetically about whether their students resemble those in the study, I must come to terms with the fact that sixty-percent of _**actual students actually sitting in my actual classes**_ believe that if they “explain to [_me_] that [they are] trying hard, [they] think [_I_] should give [them] some consideration with respect to [their] course grade.”  I must accept that fifty-percent of them** __ **believe that they deserve a B if they “have completed most [_of the mandatory_] reading for [_my_] class” or “have attended most [_of the mandatory_] classes for [_my_] course.”  I must deal with the fact that twenty-five percent of them “would think poorly of [_me if I_] didn’t respond the same day to an e-mail [they] sent.”

I could learn to deal with that.  But I’m not sure I can live in a world in which _sixteen-percent_ **** of my students think that I “should not be annoyed with [them] if [they] receive an important call during class.”
