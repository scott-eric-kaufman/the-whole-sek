Said of Joe Biden by [young Damon Weaver](http://www.palmbeachpost.com/hp/content/local\_news/epaper/2009/01/21/0121damon.html), but perhaps applicable to the new administration generally.  Obama signed an executive order re-viscerating the Freedom of Information Act [this morning](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2009/01/remarks\_by\_the\_president\_welcoming\_senior\_staff\_an.php):

The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over. Starting today, every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who seek to make it known.

To be sure, issues like personal privacy and national security must be treated with the care they demand. But the mere fact that you have the legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should always use it. The Freedom of Information Act is perhaps the most powerful instrument we have for making our government honest and transparent, and of holding it accountable. And I expect members of my administration not simply to live up to the letter but also the spirit of this law.

I will also hold myself as President to a new standard of openness. Going forward, anytime the American people want to know something that I or a former President wants to withhold, we will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel, whose business it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information will not be withheld just because I say so. It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution.

Let me say it as simply as I can: Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.

I quote at length because, like the boy says, the new administration’s informational.  Not so informational as to have the text of the executive orders [available to the public yet](http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing\_room/executive\_orders/), but it should only be a matter of time.  I write “should” instead of “will” because conservatives might be right: all this could be simple showmanship; that is, Obama could be saying his administration heralds a new era of accountability while squirreling away all the important memos with Cheney’s “[Treated as Top Secret/S.C.I.](http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/06/hbc-90000366)” stamp.  

But this potential criticism demonstrates why conservatives find themselves in a bind: to make it, they must confess that they believe opacity is a virtue; that the President alone—without the advice of the nation’s chief law enforcement officer—decides how informational his office need be.  (All such complaints exercise the same double standard that has conservatives wishing Bush had abrogated the powers he’d concentrated in the executive office before he left it.  How will they hash Obama’s apparent willingness to return them to their proper place?  [By changing the topic](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/01/022609.php).)  We can expect, then, that cries of the coming socialism will be bolstered by partisan fiskings of _the very facts the Bush administration would’ve withheld from the public_.  

While they may acknowledge the facts themselves, their import will be lost on them because for eight years they desired to know less, but feel more: to know less about the administration’s actions, but [feel certain they were effective](http://mission1accomplished.com/); to know less about the administration’s intentions, but [feel certain they were noble](http://www.newamericancentury.org/).  They wanted—they had—a faith the new administration will displace with fact.  

That they espoused ignorance and cultivated faith won’t stop them from characterizing us [as cultists](http://images.google.com/images?q=obama+kool+aid), nor should it.  Despite the administration’s commitment to transparency, conservatives will assume we feel for Obama what they felt for Bush and paint us accordingly.  Their portraits will be reflections; their medium, the very information whose absence necessitated their faith.  As for me, I welcome our new informational overlords.

I’m pretty sure you mean re-invigorating, not re-viscerating in that first paragraph.

Actually, I meant “re-viscerating.”  English is short a word for “stuffing the ripped-out guts of something back in,” so I had to make one up.

_“I think he’s long-winded because he’s informational.”_

I think there’s a case to be made that this kid is already making more sense than most of the pundits on TV. Someone should give him a job.

I love the way _Powerline_ manages to use the headline (in your linked post) “The Revisionism Begins Today” – without, apparently, the slightest bit of irony. If any “revisionism” is in evidence from this bit of fluff, it’s in _their_ facile mischaracterization of how “liberals and the MSM” have approached the Bush Administration’s grand-scale power-grabs and disregard of the law: but then, what can one expect?

They’re consistent on one point, though: right-wing opinionizers have been huffing on for years about how portside criticism of Bush’s “unitary Executive” claims are so much hypocrisy: as they have been 
fairly
 absolutely sure that the next (Democratic) President was going to turn out to be as secretive and power-hungry as Dubya, and that liberal critiques were just so much pusillanimous whining.

Of course, the fact that President Obama looks to be committed (_pace_ RW bloggers) to reversing, or at least de-opacifying some of the overarching claims of Presidential unaccountability Bush had made probably won’t deter their carping in the least: they’ll just find something else to gripe about.

Oh, and I think “re-viscerating” is a great neologism: I move we get it into the dictionary (or at least Spellcheck) a.s.a.p.

I take this seriously — my work involves accessing governmental data in a continuing and picky way.  I’ve seen just about every type of FOIA run-around there is, including one time when the organization I was working with [had to sue](http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/2915/1/242?TopicID=1) to shake lose something that the government had no real excuse for keeping secret other than no one had sued them yet.  

So I’m willing to believe that Obama is serious about this, and will be testing it fairly soon.  Yet I think I can say I’m [demonstrably not an Obama cultist](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com/2009/01/poetry-for-obamas-inauguration.html).  Not that it matters what the wingnuts think, really.

re-viscerating is a wonderful term!  and it makes good use of existing language and its rules, so it isn’t actually a made-up word.

this is an amazing thing to hear from a president, particularly on the first full day in office:  that he is going to make sure personally that the information of government gets shared, as it should be. 

there could not be a starker way to mark the change of command, or the change of attitude.  a whole lot of government offices are going to need to fire up the copy machines, pronto, because the people have been waiting.  many for a long time.

Obama sez “we will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel, whose business it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information will not be withheld just because I say so. It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution.”

Nice, except this describes the procedure in the Bush II White House. Gonzalez and Miers, those stellar ‘separate authorities’, were consulted and checked off on all of it. Good luck, Rich.

Except that Bush didn’t believe the business of the AG and WHC was to ensure compliance with the rule of law; he believed the business of the AG and WHC was to cover the president’s ass.

It’s true that there’s nothing Obama can _say_ that will prove that he intends more than lip service.  But Bush didn’t even give that.

Why go Latinate when you could have a good Anglo-Saxon word like “enguttening”? “A new President enguttens us all!”

ajay-

That would work, if applied to something that previously never had guts – Frex, any of Dorothy’s traveling companions.  However, I believe the working hypothesis is that the FOIA did, and they were removed.  Hence, the good A-S word s/b “regut.”

I regut; you regut; he, she, it reguts.  

I regutted.  

I was regutted.  

I will regut.  

Can somebody help me with future perfect passive subjunctive?  That shall have been such a stumbling block.

jazzbumpa-

The real challenge is when we get around to nominalizing the verb. Do we go with “guttery?” “Guttination?” “Guttitude?” “Guttulery?” “Guttenberg?” “Steve?”

The possibilities overwhelm me.

Ewwww, that’s totally regutsing. I feel like throwing up my hands. Can’t we cut this tripe and rectify our analysis?

Oh, and Bush thought he embodied the rule of law, so needed no ass-covering. Those puns not intended.

Reviscerate is a perfectly cromnulent word.
