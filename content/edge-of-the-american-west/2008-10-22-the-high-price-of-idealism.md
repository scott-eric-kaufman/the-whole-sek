On this day in 2008, [Jim Beaver](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0064769/)—a.k.a. Ellsworth—[commented](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/deadwood\_and\_to.html#comment-135658135) on my post about [the language of _Deadwood_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/deadwood\_and\_to.html).  I know that’s not really historical, but damn it, it’s cool.  Now for something completely historical:

On this day in 1929, Ursula K. Le Guin was born to Alfred and Theodora Kroeber—though you wouldn’t know it from [this article](http://www.jstor.org/stable/671284), in which no mention of him having fathered one of the 20th Century’s most influential science fiction writers appears.  Her [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula\_K.\_Le\_Guin) was adapted from a bad student essay, as is evidenced by how thoroughly the narrative of how-I-came-to-learn-this pervades it.

Her mother’s biography of Alfred Kroeber, _Alfred Kroeber: A Personal Configuration_, is a good source for Le Guin’s early years and for the biographical elements in her late works, especially her interest in social anthropology.

Bully on you, anonymous person, for evaluating your sources.  That said, the aforelinked review ain’t much better.  We’re told:

Alfred Kroeber (1876-1960) is amply known through his works—more than five hundred publications of which eight are books—and he was familiar in varying degrees to students, because he taught at [universities].

I’ve edited out the list of illustrious institutions, but really, I wish I’d been an academic in an earlier era, when such sentences could be published.  (Not too early, though—say, Post-Trilling-as-Columbia’s-sole-Jew or thereabouts.)  But I digress.  Alfred Kroeber, known through his 500 publications and by students, was a proponent of “[salvage ethnography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage\_ethnography).  Here’s a picture of him with [Ishi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishi), who claimed to be the last of the California Yahi:

[![ishi](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/ishi.jpg?w=490 "ishi")](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/ishi.jpg)

Cultural preservation takes a place of pride in Le Guin’s work, albeit backwardly, via her frequent evocation of cultural obliteration.  In her anti-reform novel extraordinaire [_The Lathe of Heaven_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380791854/diesekoschmar-20), she skewers the idea that society can be changed for the better.  All progress, she argues, entails the destruction of a society whose current form is the by-product of an evolutionary process.  It may not be a just society, but it’s not an invented one, and thus is far more stable than the proto-totalitarian imaginings of well-intentioned liberals.  As [Sean McCann and my adviser, Michael Szalay, argue](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/yale\_journal\_of\_criticism/v018/18.2mccann02.html), the novel

offers an all but direct allegory in which a passive aesthetic sensibility comes to replace an illegitimate effort to transform the world through instrumental means. Le Guin’s George Orr discovers that his dreams change the world; almost nightly he has what he calls “effective dreams” that reshape existence. Upon waking, Orr is the only one who recalls what the world used to be like, the only one who realizes that each night his mind refashions the lives of the planet’s billions. Orr turns to government therapists to find assistance in ending his dreams, but is understood instead to be delusional and irrationally afraid of his unconscious. He is thus committed to the care of one William Haber, a state-employed psychiatrist who quickly discovers that Orr does indeed dream effectively, and who then tries to use Orr’s dreams to rid the world of misery. Orr objects, and Le Guin organizes this novel around the ensuing debate between the two men over whether it’s right to change the world . . . .

[But] this kind of idealism comes at a high price. Every time Haber induces Orr to dream a better world, something in Orr resists; when told to solve the color problem, Orr dreams a world in which all are a dull and listless battleship gray; when told to end all human conflict, Orr invents an alien invasion that threatens earth from the sky. Awake, he tells Haber, “it’s not right to play God with masses of people. . . . just believing you are right and your motives are good isn’t enough.” Le Guin’s sympathies are unambiguously with her dreamer, whose resistance to Haber’s megalomania resembles both the New Left’s resistance to traditional politics and the Women’s Movement resistance to the New Left itself.  Haber does eliminate the many ills on which he set his sights: he brags to Orr that they have “Eliminated overpopulation; restored the quality of urban life and the ecological balance of the planet. Eliminated cancer as a major killer. . . . Eliminated the color problem, racial hatred. Eliminated war. . . . Eliminated—no, say in the process of eliminating—poverty, economic inequality, the class war, all over the world.” But Orr refuses to grant the importance of these accomplishments because, regardless of the outcome, he doesn’t “want to change things.” These were views consistent with the widely shared sense that technocratic solutions to social problems were invariably misguided. But, like Mailer and many of her contemporaries, Le Guin does not merely worry about the unintended consequences or heedless arrogance of technocratic power; she counters it to what by contrast appears a more fundamental spiritual and political accomplishment—a therapeutic acceptance of reality itself. “We’re in the world, not against it,” Orr responds, “you have to let it be.”

Their treatment of Le Guin ([tackled previously](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/do\_you\_believe\_in\_magic\_literary\_thinking\_and\_the\_new\_left/)) is particularly compelling given what we all hope is the imminent rise of a new technocracy made of Hope and Change and Yes We Cans.  I mean, can you believe that?  Academic work that’s immediately relevant coming from _an English department_?  What’s the world coming to?  (And why can’t it arrive sooner?)

_All progress, she argues, entails the destruction of a society whose current form is the by-product of an evolutionary process. It may not be a just society, but it’s not an invented one, and thus is far more stable than the proto-totalitarian imaginings of well-intentioned liberals._

This is a bit too broad: remember that George Orr’s world starts off in ruins, devastated by nuclear war, until he dreamt the war away. It’s only in the context of a world once saved by Orr’s dreams that Haber’s only-sometimes-well-intentioned schemes can happen at all…

The Kroebers (incl. of course LeGuin) are an underappreciated family in American intellectual history.  Alfred was an English major, if I recall correctly, before he was snagged by Boas and became his first PH.d student at Columbia.  “The Superorganic” is one of the more ambitious essays of its era in attempting to define culture, but also full of oddity.  Something for your 2nd book, SEK.

IMHO, _The Lathe Of Heaven_ is LeGuin’s worst adult book.  She tried to be Phillip K. Dick for the space of one novel, and it didn’t work.  You will get a far better understanding of the author by reading _The Dispossessed_ or _The Left Hand of Darkness_ or _The Telling_.

Her father’s anthro influence is most clearly visible in _Planet of Exile_.

From where I’m sitting, I can see the anthropology museum where Ishi, the guy pictured above, lived after Kroeber “took him in” until his death. And while the critique of a certain kind of high modernist technocratic politics is thought provoking, I wonder to what extent the retreat from one kind of active politics implies the kind of “Acceptance” of reality in which the idea of “salvage ethnography” becomes a reasonable thing to do. Ishi was given a place to live, but he did so by becoming a museum piece, in ways that I think have to be thought hard about; after all, the whole point of “salvage ethnography” is to translate cultural difference as a thing in the process of inevitably passing away, right? And _accepting_ that narrative is a big part of making that narrative true.

In that sense, Szaley and McCann’s account of LeGuin’s book feels a lot like the thrust of James Scott’s _Seeing Like a State_, a book I really admire, but which is vulnerable to the critiques that by emphasizing only the failings of state planning (Scott’s subtitle is “How Certain Efforts to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed”), you systematically blind yourself to the good that instrumental means of changing the world can have, as well as the extent to which it’s impossible to not be already embedded in chains of instrumental means of changing the world. Everything we do has consequences, _especially_ the things we “accept” as inevitable. In that sense, it seems to me that “Salvage Ethnography” and laissez faire capitalism (and Brad Delong called Scott a closet Hayekian some time ago [here](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Econ\_Articles/Reviews/seeing\_like\_a\_state.html)) have this in common; they both manage to justify an acceptance of the status quo by dis-imagining the ways one is already complicit in the system, by creating a hard and fast distinction between action and acceptance that really doesn’t obtain in practice.

_This is a bit too broad_

That it is, Gerry.  To be honest, I blame Ari.  I was stuck on this sentence:

_Cultural preservation takes a place of pride in Le Guin’s work, albeit backwardly, via her frequent evocation of cultural obliteration._

Which is, when you think about it, the biggest literary-historical claim I made (or, more accurately, didn’t make).  She values cultural preservation, but for far more conservative—one might say, cynical—reasons than either of her parents.  But I’m _way_ out of my depth here, historically or historically-of-science-speaking.  

_Ellsworth is cool, but call me when Robin Wiegert shows up at your blog._

[I apologize](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0XBHpXLkUs&feature=related).

_Something for your 2nd book, SEK._

This suggests I have a first.  Would that it were true!  (But yes, reading around last night I got the distinct feeling I could imagine doing more with the evolution of the idea of cultural evolution and how it was rearticulated through the dominant evolutionary paradigms of the day—whichever day that may be.  Because, you know, I like to keep things manageable, which is why tips like yours and joel’s are so valuable.)

_the whole point of “salvage ethnography” is to translate cultural difference as a thing in the process of inevitably passing away, right?_

I think if you stick an “into” in there, you’ll have nailed it: “the whole point of ‘salvage ethnography’ is to translate cultural difference **into** a thing in the process of inevitably passing away, right?”  Man into museum piece; language into archive; life into photographs; &c.

_Everything we do has consequences, especially the things we “accept” as inevitable._

As the great libertarian philosopher Geddy Lee reminds us—and I paraphrase—should you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.  (This is what happens when you make me feel guilty for not having read something that sounds so interesting: you get Rushed.)

Yes, please. And I think you can skip straight to your second book — you’ll be more experienced.

Perhaps if I read the whole paper (followed link, behind pay wall) I would get a better view, but from what is presented in the excerpt… I’m sorry, but a paper that presents Haber’s claim that, among other things, they have “Eliminated overpopulation; restored the quality of urban life and the ecological balance of the planet.”, and then says

But Orr refuses to grant the importance of these accomplishments because, regardless of the outcome, he doesn’t “want to change things.” These were views consistent with the widely shared sense that technocratic solutions to social problems were invariably misguided.

without elaborating on what Haber means by “solved the population problem” is not honestly representing the book.  Yes, you can claim to have solved the population problem after disappearing 9/10ths of the people of the world, but to claim that Orr is troubled by this solution (and implying that it is a petty and small minded worry) only because “he doesn’t ‘want to change things'” strikes me as shockingly dishonest.

I also don’t accept the assertion that Haber represents technocratic power.  If anything, the book is a re-telling of the “careful what you wish for” geni-of-the-lamp story from the perspective of the geni (Orr.)  Haber neither knows nor cares how Orr’s effective dreaming works; the technocratic impulse and hacker curiosity is completely missing from his personality.

I’m going to x-post this comment because the post appeared twice and because, well, that’s how I roll.

Scott,

Not that I want to revisit the whole fiber of the argument I made at the Valve about “Do You Believe In Magic?”, but let’s approach this question of LeGuin’s novel specifically. McCann and Szalay read LeGuin as a product of her own era, almost as if she got her philosophy from “Let It Be” the song, and to an extent that’s quite fair: whatever ideologies she draws upon, her way of using them will reflect her own historical moment.

Nonetheless, LeGuin is a Taoist. The kinds of statements she makes in The Lathe of Heaven echo, often word for word, the verses in the Tao Te Ching, which was written in the 6th Century BC and was not about technocracy as we understand it at the start of the 21st Century.

I raise this point because there is a chicken-and-egg problem here: is technocracy the result of what technology enables us to do, or is it a modern version of debates about governance that have been ongoing for thousands of years? My problem with embracing the former version without hesitation or qualification is that it encourages us to see technocratic governance as something without precedent, and therefore as utterly plastic and unlimited in potential. We think technocracy is wrong because the example of the Soviet Union is so frightening, but we should just consider the New Deal — that is what technocracy really _ought_ to look like.

Throughout the essay there is a strong current of support for government-led solutions to social problems, and I find that entirely sympathetic. I wish we had another New Deal coming our way. That said, the most functional parts of the American democracy — the ones we all learned about in high school government class — involve impediments to progress, ways of creating inertia so that deliberation can win the day. In other words, it is a principle of sound government to “let things be” until a change gathers broad momentum, and it is a principle based on a certain view of human nature — and that neither can nor should be historicized away.

_The Dispossesed_ has almost the opposite point — it portrays a society founded on idealism that is being slowly corrupted as its idealism fades, and the protagonist is the one who renews it.  And as someone else said, it’s more typical of LeGuin’s outlook.
