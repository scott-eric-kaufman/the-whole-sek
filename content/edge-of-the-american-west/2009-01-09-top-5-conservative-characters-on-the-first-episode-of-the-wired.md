(_This isn’t a guest post by nobody’s friend, [Ben Shaprio](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/author/bshapiro/).  This is just [a tribute](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bshapiro/2009/01/08/top-5-conservative-characters-in-lost/).  Via [S, N!](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/16078.html)_)

I first got into HBO’s hit television program _The Wired_ about two years ago.  A stranger mentioned it to the person in front of him at the _700 Club_ cafeteria, and by the time I finished the first episode, I knew I would be telling people I was completely hooked.  (This, by the way, is my Recruitment Rule for _The Wired_: watch the first four minutes.  If you don’t like it by then, dump out.)  I am so excited by my enthusiasm for the show, in fact, that I often tout the first episode of _The Wired_ as the best show in the history of television.  I don’t simply love this episode for its terrific acting, wonderful writing, quirkly plotting, or mind-boggling twists.  I also love it because of its subtle conservatism.  Here are the top five conservative characters on the first episode of _The Wired_.  Beware—SPOILERS INCLUDED.

![wire1-rawls](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-rawls.jpg?w=300&h=272 "wire1-rawls")

**1.  William Rawls:** John Doman’s tough Homicide investigator, William Rawls, is the top conservative character on television, bar none.  Rawls is a real man’s man, a true paragon of conservative integrity.  He knows that America is a meritocracy and, according to Wikipedia, in [Season 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_Rawls#Season\_4) openly attacks the reverse racism of affirmative action by proving that, instead of working up the ranks honestly like he has, the blacks in the Baltimore Police Department were recruited up the chain of command because of the color of their skin.  This racism created a leadership vacuum, and like true conservatives, Rawls knows the value of a true leader of men.  He may not always love the men beneath him, but he knows they need discipline and is determined to give it to them.

![wire3-mcnulty](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire3-mcnulty.jpg?w=490 "wire3-mcnulty")

**2.  Jimmy McNulty:** If every public servant showed McNulty’s commitment to civic duty, we would never have heard the odious phrase “President-Elect Obama” said without a snigger.  In this episode alone, McNulty attends a trial when he could have been at home and stays up all night to make sure his report is on his deputy’s desk at 0800 clean and with no typos.  Here he is in a clip from Season 2, going above and beyond the call of duty:


He’s also a family man who wants nothing more than the judge to give him more than three out of four weekends with his children.

![wire1-snotboogie](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-snotboogie.jpg?w=490 "wire1-snotboogie")

**3.  Snot Boogie:** Every Friday night, anonymous young black men would roll bones behind the Cut Rate, and every Friday night, Snot Boogie would wait until there was cash on the ground, grab it, and run away.  Snot Boogie knew these games were unsanctioned and bravely confiscated the illegal proceeds even though he knew the young black men would catch him and beat his ass.  To do what you know to be right, no matter the consequence, is a true conservative value.

![thewire-anonymousyoungblackmen](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/thewire-anonymousyoungblackmen.jpg?w=490 "thewire-anonymousyoungblackmen")

**4.  The Anonymous Young Black Men behind the Cut Rate:** The anonymous young black men behind the Cut Rate are American icons.  They let Snot Boogie in the game even though he always stole the money because “[i]t’s America, man.”  But it’s not _liberal_ America, man, as should be obvious both by their devotion to the idea that while this is a free country, all decisions have consequences, and their commitment to capital punishment.  They could have just whooped Snot Boogie’s ass like they always whoop his ass, but the anonymous young black men behind the Cut Rate know how to prevent the next generation of Snot Boogies from repeating the mistakes of the previous.

![wire1-stringerandbarks](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-stringerandbarks.jpg?w=490 "wire1-stringerandbarks")

**5.  Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell:** I cheated here, but this is a Top 5, not a Top 6.  Avon and Stringer are pure capitalists, compassionate but tough.  Avon is a family man.  When his cousin D’Angelo comes to him asking for a job, Avon and Stringer decide to give him one.  But both men know there’s no such thing as a free lunch, so they also decide to teach D’Angelo that, in America, hard work is its own reward.  Everyone has to start in the pit, but with a little hard work, anyone can end up running a tower.

The first episode of _The Wired_ is a show chock-full of conservative values. It mentions God and quotes the Bible on a regular basis. It debates police vs. criminals and free enterprise vs. socialism. It promotes the value of the nuclear family—virtually every character on the show has dealt with a broken home, and they all pay the price for it.  But everyone should know that the first episode of _The Wired_ is one of the most conservative shows on TV. That’s part of what makes it so juicy.

Wow. You should be proud: this could easily be taken for the real thing.

Oh no, SEK, you’re not fooling me.  _The Wired_ is a liberal show made by a self-confessed liberal.  I know this because James Hudnall [says](http://www.thehousenextdooronline.com/2006/12/wire-mondays-season-four-ep-49-thats.html?showComment=1165278420000#c116527842561008325) so.  And pay no attention to the self-confessed liberal’s [weak response](http://www.thehousenextdooronline.com/2006/12/wire-mondays-season-four-ep-49-thats.html?showComment=1165509600000#c116550965376129314).  That’s not going to fool me either.

_It promotes the value of the nuclear family—virtually every character on the show has dealt with a broken home, and they all pay the price for it._

I thought the first season of _24_ was fascinating for the family values/good choices aspect. Had Kim Bauer never snuck out of the house at night, would her kidnapping have been possible? There are a lot of little things like that spread throughout the show where if people had just followed the rules and lived right there never would have been an opening for the bad guys, or so the implication goes.

The show is called “The WIRE”, not “Wired”.

Hilarious!!  Though your “blog like Glenn Reynolds day” remains my favorite parody. 

A whole freaking two years after you told me to watch it, we finally got around to it. So far, we finished season 1. Do not tell me what happens.

Though I could not possibly get drunk enough to read all of Shapiro’s original post without either barfing or passing out, I did have a snort of 15 yr old Glenlivet, and make it to this memorable line.

“Sure he sleeps around – what con man worth his salt doesn’t? But he votes Republican”

Your mockery is brilliant, but, oh my — he does do such a fine, fine job of mocking himself.

BL, _you should listen to me when I’m talking to you_!  Then you wouldn’t deny yourself the rapture that’s _The Wire_ for the better part of two years.

jazzbumpa, you know, it’s not easy to top such stupidity, but damn it, I do try.  I’m not sure how many more in-jokes I could’ve included without coming across as 1) an utter homophobe or 2) Charles Murray.  Parody ain’t easy when the pickings hang so low, but you know what, [I’m about to do it again](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/ggutfeld/2009/01/09/an-%!E(MISSING)2%9Copen%!E(MISSING)2%99-letter-to-henry-rollins/).  As I’ll post on Monday—when people stop spending time with their useless families and recommit to more important matters, like this here blog—I fear “mocking conservative forays into cultural relevance will become my life’s work if I don’t tamp the urge down yesterday, but with material so fine, how can I resist?”

I just noticed Andrew Breitbart’s name atop the “Big Hollywood” logo.  All has become clear.

Not sure if this is parody or pastich.  It is in no way light-hearted.

I know you could only go 5 deep, but Omar is the stand-alone, get what you can, never give an inch, Ayn Rand, perfect man. I know that as non-white and gay, he’s a little hard to picture at an AEI forum, but still, when he wants something, he just takes it. Definitely an SEC Comissioner in the next Bush administration.

Rawls was an inspired pick for top dog conservative not least for reasons of that brilliant little shot in the bar which you may or may not be alluding to. But you are too subtle for me, SEK.

**Barbar**

					

		

“The Game is the Game” — Avon, Stringer, Marlo all understood that liberal moral relativism is silly and that standards for behavior don’t change over time.  This dovetails nicely with conservative belief in the Rule of Law.  I’m pretty sure none of these guys would be on board with a “living constitution.”

7. Snoop.  At what she knows to be an important juncture in her life, Snoop asks, “How my hair look?”  This shows her ability to keep things in perspective.  Putting things in perspective is good, and conservatism is good.  Hence, Snoop is a conservative.
