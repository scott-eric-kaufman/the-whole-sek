		<p>I&#8217;m holding off on that other <em>Watchmen</em> post because I think I might, um, be wrong about something fairly central to my argument.  In the meantime, I have a declaration to make: I love Debbie Schlussel.  Her <a href="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/archives/2009/03/the_watchmen_li.html">review of <em>Watchmen</em></a> is simply to die for.  To wit:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you take your kids to see &#8220;The Watchmen,&#8221; you&#8217;re a moron.  If you see it yourself, you&#8217;re also probably a moron and a vapid, indecent human being.</p></blockquote>
<p>Set aside the fact that she punts the film&#8217;s title.  Set aside the fact that she punts the film&#8217;s title <em>even though the poster is included in the post.</em> Concentrate instead on how she castigates hypothetical parents who would take their children to an R-rated film.  Who is her audience?  Who does she imagine it is?</p>
<blockquote><p>I know, it&#8217;s being heavily marketed as a superhero movie, with <a href="http://www.watchmencomicmovie.com/watchmen-action-figures-toys.php">action figures</a> for your kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see now&#8212;her audience consists of people who never click on links.  Because if they did, they&#8217;d see Schlussel links to a limited run of 5,000 figures designed for I-buy-<a href="http://www.superherotimes.com/news/images/WDCU.MiniBust.PowerGirl.jpg">Power-Girl-statuettes</a> crowd.  But what about the hypothetical children?  Who will care for the hypothetical children?</p>
<blockquote><p>But then, we see cops looking over their naked, bloodied, dead bodies on a bed, with the words &#8220;LESBIAN WHORES,&#8221; written in blood on the wall.</p>
<p><em>Mommy, mommy, what&#8217;s a lesbian? What&#8217;s a whore?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So our hypothetical terrible parent takes her hypothetical toddler to see an R-rated movie and&#8212;what&#8217;s an R-rated picture again?</p>
<blockquote><p>An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion pictures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you, <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/FlmRat_Ratings.asp">official Motion Picture Association of America</a> guidelines.  Let&#8217;s compare rubric of the R-rating to Schlussel&#8217;s litany of offensive scenes in the film:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> Two superheroes have an explicit sex scene in a spaceship&#8211;she&#8217;s on top, then he&#8217;s on top, awesome&#8211;you can teach your young kids multiple sexual positions before they even reach puberty, by taking them to see this (there&#8217;s a less explicit sex scene between the slutty superheroine and another superhero not long before that).</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . sexually-oriented nudity . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation normal.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> Superhero &#8220;The Comedian&#8221; (a bad Robert Downey, Jr. look-alike) brutally beating and raping another superhero[.]</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . adult themes . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation normal..</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> [S]uperheroes hurling obscenities[.]</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . hard language . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation normal.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> A man&#8217;s hands and arms being sawed off with an electric saw&#8211;we&#8217;re shown the bloody stumps and the bloody sawed off limbs in close up shots[.]</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . intense or persistent violence . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems Schlussel has been offended by the very elements the MPAA guidelines predict will be in an R-rated film.  Her whole argument, then, is that some parents would be dumb enough to take young children to a film that no one believes young children should see&#8212;and that only Debbie Schlussel can save them from their own craven stupidity.  That can&#8217;t be right.  She can&#8217;t possibly fashion herself Debbie Schlussel: Defender of the Morbidly Obtuse.  Or can she?</p>
<p><span id="more-8022"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>THE THING IS THAT MOST PARENTS DON&#8217;T READ THE GRAPHIC NOVELS AND ARE UNAWARE THAT IT&#8217;S NOT REALLY A SUPERHERO MOVIE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course she can.  That she responds to criticism in ALL CAPS* means we should rename her DEBBIE SCHLUSSEL: DEFENDER OF THE MORBIDLY OBTUSE.  But only some of them:</p>
<blockquote><p>UH, I DON&#8217;T NEED TO &#8220;DO MY HOMEWORK&#8221; WHEN I WATCH AND CRITIQUE A MOVIE THAT&#8217;S SICKENING AND MARKETED AT KIDS. ALL I NEED TO DO IS WATCH IT AND KEEP MY SANITY, WHICH ALL OF YOU WATCHMEN IDIOTS APPARENTLY LONG AGO GAVE UP.  NO, YOU DON&#8217;T HAVE TO BE INTELLIGENT TO FULLY ENJOY IT. ON THE CONTRARY, AS YOU AND THE OTHER WATCHMEN IDIOTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED, YOU HAVE TO BE A COMPLETE FLIPPING IDIOT WITH ZERO INTELLECT AND SOUL. CALLING THIS STUPID STORYLINE A FANTASTIC PLOT JUST SHOWS HOW SIMPLE AND EMPTY YOU ARE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calm down now, Debbie.  See?  No more ALL CA&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>AND THANKS FOR EDUCATING ME THAT RAPE AND GRISLY VIOLENCE IS HIGH CULTURE THAT I DON&#8217;T &#8220;GET.&#8221; GO TELL IT TO YOUR FRIENDS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE FILM CLASS OR G.E.D. SCHOOL. IT MIGHT FLY THERE. FYI, MEIN KAMPF IS A VISION OF AN ALTERNATE WORLD. MAYBE WE SHOULD WORSHIP THAT, TOO, AIRHEAD.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now look here, Deb&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>THANKS FOR EXPLAINING TO ME THE COMPLETELY IDIOTIC REASONING BEHIND SUPPORTING AND MINDLESSLY DEFENDING THIS PIECE OF CRAP. WE KNOW WHO THE IDIOT IS&#8211;THE GUY YOU SEE IN YOUR MIRROR. IF SOMEONE RAPES YOUR MOTHER AND SLICES OFF YOUR LIMBS WITH AN ELECTRIC SAW, I WON&#8217;T CARE, BECAUSE, AFTER ALL IT WAS IN A GRAPHIC NOVEL FIRST, &#8220;YOU IDIOT.&#8221; SO WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THIS KIND OF THING. OH, AND I THINK I&#8217;LL DONATE A CAPE AND MASK TO THE RAPIST/LIMB-CUTTER. BECAUSE, AFTER ALL, WE MUST BREAK THE MOLD OF THE SUPERHERO AND CELEBRATE IT. ANTI-CHOICE? SHE MADE THE CHOICE WHEN SHE HAD A KID. THIS IS CHILD ABUSE, BUT HEY, IT WAS IN A GRAPHIC NOVEL AND BREAKS THE MOLD OF SUPERHEROES.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could someone grab the thoraz&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>THE BACKGROUND EXCUSE. SO, IF THERE&#8217;S A &#8220;BACKGROUND&#8221; OF A &#8220;GRAPHIC NOVEL&#8221; THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AND DEPRAVITY LIKE TOTALLY AWESOME. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT&#8217;S ABOUT AND THE BACKGROUND, AND THAT DOESN&#8217;T JUSTIFY A THING. SO SAD FOR HITLER&#8211;HE COMMITTED SUICIDE WAY TOO SOON. IF HE&#8217;D ONLY HUNG ON TO THE YEAR 2009 AND THE &#8220;BACKGROUND&#8221; AND &#8220;GRAPHIC NOVEL&#8221; EXCUSE, THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS SO MUCH BETTER. I GOT THE &#8220;MESSAGE&#8221;&#8211;NOT SURE HOW IT JUSTIFIES A THING. SOME SAY HITLER HAD A &#8220;GREAT MESSAGE.&#8221; EVER READ MEIN KAMPF? I GUESS MAYBE A MESSAGE JUSTIFIES COOKING PEOPLE IN OVENS, TOO. BUT, HEY, HE FORGOT TO MAKE MEIN KAMPF INTO A GRAPHIC NOVEL. BIG MISTAKE.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll calm down and realize that her reaction was a little rash.</p>
<blockquote><p>We know there are bad people and that people are everyday people with problems. If you don&#8217;t know that, and you think a movie like this is necessary to make the point, you&#8217;re even more warped and stupid than I originally diagnosed. And maybe your sister should be fed to dogs and your mother raped and your brother should have his arms sawed off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or not.  I&#8217;m sure she speaks for <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bwillingham/2009/03/05/a-few-predictions-about-watchmen/#more-73242">conservatives everywhe</a>&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>I love Rorschach was amazing . . . [a]nd Rorschach is this Conservative&#8217;s hero.</p></blockquote>
<p>Must be an outlier.  There&#8217;s always someone who mis&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Rorschach will do in the general population exactly what he did in the comics community. He&#8217;ll seem to be disturbed at first, but actually come away unintentionally by the creators, as the hero of the piece.</p></blockquote>
<p>So . . . more on Manhattan as a figure of the reader as soon as I quell my doubts.</p>
<hr />
*I&#8217;m aware she has an explanation for why she does this.  But as I noted in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/teaching-the-overdetermined-image-.html">my first post about my course</a>, even when Alan Moore uses ALL CAPS in 1985 he still looks like an internet crank.  Schlussel seems to not understand the rhetorical effect of her purely practical explanation.  It doesn&#8217;t help her case that the <em>content</em> of her ALL CAPS commentary frequently scales the heights of internet crankdom . . . </p>

						<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with Debbie Schlussel, but I suspect her fundamental error here is one that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people make &#8212; it&#8217;s the assumption that any printed narrative told with pictures, any &#8220;comic&#8221;, must be intended for children. These people apparently missed the last thirty years of popular entertainment, including and especially the emergence of the graphic novel, and are still stuck in their Disney-esque media universe of the middle of the century.<br />
They simply cannot fathom, even after reading one, and even after seeing the move adaption, that a graphic novel might tackle serious or difficult themes.</p>

						<p>Maybe, just as you&#8217;ve been describing the various characters in this story as demonstrations of the likely dysfunctions of super-powered humans, Schlussel is a character who demonstrates . . . er . . .who exposes . . . um . . .</p>
<p>Okay, so she&#8217;s a windup toy with a broken crank. She probably reads Jonathan Swift as a monster, and Stephen Colbert as a paragon of conservatism.</p>

						<p>I have no idea who Debbie Schlussel is. Wikipedia says:</p>
<p><i>a blogger critical towards the what she perceives to be militant Islamist groups in the United States on her website. Her columns are often controversial, specifically regarding elements of Islam and prominent American Muslims. In between these accounts, Schlussel frequently narrows her reporting onto such topics as favored mustard brands</i></p>
<p>Mustard and Muslims &#8211; you can naturally only choose one. Why do you hate mustard?</p>

						<p>I do not know this Debbie person, and her ilk (the self-appointed moralists) is often generally unattractive, at best.  I also know nothing of Watchman, book or movie, other than what I heard on &#8220;Here &amp; Now&#8221; earlier today (bleh).  In addition, I have serious objections to much of what the MPAA does, from its rather irrational and crudely administered standards, to its anonymity, to its (especially) function as an arm of Hollywood to suppress the distribution of independent films (film-makers must pony up the cabbage to pay the MPAA to rate their films, and its considerable).  But I&#8217;m also old enough to recall the pre-MPAA suystem (hand written notes taped to the window at the theater&#8217;s discretion which said &#8220;Adults Only&#8221;) as well as the early years of the MPAA system, which were enforced in a desultory fashion.  This led to things like the famous case in my (almost) home town, Trenton NJ, where exceedingly young children had been dropped off at George Romero&#8217;s &#8220;Night of the Living Dead.&#8221;  I myself saw &#8220;Once Upon a Time in the West&#8221; in the theater when I was 12; hardly as disturbing as &#8220;Night of the Living Dead,&#8221; of course, but it was originally rated &#8220;Mature&#8221; by the MPAA.  (It&#8217;s been changed to &#8220;PG-13&#8221; since then.  So there&#8217;s the logic of the MPAA for you:  Spike Lee&#8217;s &#8220;Get on the Bus&#8221; is rated &#8220;R&#8221; due to language, but &#8220;Once Upon a Time,&#8221; brimming with sadistic violence, including the point-blank shooting of what appears to be about an 8 year-old girl in the head by Henry Fonda, gets a &#8220;PG-13.&#8221;)  One of the problems with all such systems&#8211;if you believe children shouldn&#8217;t be subjected to such films&#8211;even if their parents don&#8217;t care and even when the theaters are obeying the bottom line&#8211;is that the ticket booth is the gate.  People like this Debbie person, as regrettable as she may be, serve a function:  they remind the theater owner to keep the gate.  Does it matter with a film like this?  It seems to me you&#8217;ve been rather selective in your reprinting of what we have in this film.  If our Debbie is to be trusted, cinemaphiles can look forward to relishing:</p>
<p>* Dogs fighting over, tearing apart, and eating a six-year-old girl&#8211;we&#8217;re shown them chowing down on and tearing apart the remaining leg and leg bone, with the sock and shoe still on the bone as the dogs wrestle over it;</p>
<p>* A close up of man repeatedly getting an axe-blade driven through his skull while he&#8217;s being butchered;</p>
<p>* At least two very graphic scenes of naked superhero &#8220;Dr. Manhattan&#8221; vaporizing people to just blood, limbs, and guts hanging from the ceiling or spread in the snow;</p>
<p>* Many scenes of Dr. Manhattan&#8217;s computer generated penis swinging about;</p>
<p>* A kid biting a giant, bloody chunk of flesh out of another kid&#8217;s face&#8211;he grows up to be &#8220;Rorschach,&#8221; one of the superheroes&#8217; compatriots;</p>
<p>* A man&#8217;s hands and arms being sawed off with an electric saw&#8211;we&#8217;re shown the bloody stumps and the bloody sawed off limbs in close up shots;</p>
<p>* A man with vat of hot french fry oil deliberately thrown over his head&#8211;we literally see him fry, and he ultimately dies, we&#8217;re told (no kidding);</p>
<p>* Many, many scenes of people&#8217;s hands, arms, fingers being broken in half or crunched by the &#8220;superheroes&#8221;;</p>
<p>* Cops being set on fire and burning to death by superhero compatriot &#8220;Rorschach;&#8221;</p>
<p>and etc.  The whole thing sounds vile, like one of Oliver North&#8217;s wet-dreams, but I certainly wouldn&#8217;t suppress it.  Should parents have an idea what they&#8217;re in for when their kids press them to take them to this?  I would think so.</p>

						<p>one thing i&#8217;m not getting, scott. i can tell you don&#8217;t like her general views about the movie, but what&#8217;s your complaint about the early, non-cap quotes, i.e. her stuff about kids?</p>
<p>she thinks that this movie would not be suitable for kids.</p>
<p>and i take it you also think the movie would not be suitable for kids?</p>
<p>so where&#8217;s the disagreement? is it that she predicts that some parents will bring their kids to an unsuitable movie, and you think that no parents will bring their kids to an unsuitable movie?</p>
<p>so do you agree on what parents *ought* to do, and simply disagree in your predictions of what they *will* do?</p>
<p>or what?</p>

						<p>kid bitzer, I won&#8217;t hazard to answer for SEK, but for myself what&#8217;s objectionable about the review is that it:</p>
<p>(1) doesn&#8217;t actually review the material on its own terms;</p>
<p>(2) uses the movie as an excuse to set up a panic about &#8220;liberal&#8221;* media threatening &#8220;our&#8221; children.</p>
<p>On the latter point, I don&#8217;t think it is coincidental that she harps on the lesbian moments in the film.</p>
<p>*I should note that the author, Alan Moore, a professed anarchist would probably be aghast at being labeled as &#8220;liberal.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Should parents have an idea what they’re in for when their kids press them to take them to this? </i></p>
<p>Sure, but one should probably start with the R rating (in contrast to most of the rest of the &#8220;superhero&#8221; films.)  It&#8217;s not as though this is being marketed as the feel-good heir to Superman here, so Schlussel seems to be seriously misdescribing it if she&#8217;s seriously worried that parents are taking their ten-year-olds to it.  (It&#8217;s also probably worth pointing out that a lot of the violence in the comic book is off-panel, hinted at rather than drawn.)</p>

						<p>I think, kb (and, like Buster, I won&#8217;t speak for SEK), that the problem is she&#8217;s warning people of the dangers of taking their kids to a movie they&#8217;ve already been warned against taking their kids to.

						<p>Well, it&#8217;s more that she&#8217;s describing it as a liberal conspiracy to inculcate your pre-teens about hot sex and violence, and the problem with the conspiracy angle is that they&#8217;re really not pushing it towards the pre-teen market at all, as evidence by the R-rating, the lack of action figures, afaik no happy meals, etc.</p>
<p>And, I&#8217;d be willing to bet she didn&#8217;t have the same freakout over <i>300</i>, a heroic action movie rated R with lots of hot sex and closeups of gruesome violence (including DecapitationCam.)  So.  What&#8217;s the real worry here?  </p>
<p>Granted, Schlussel&#8217;s the moron who, after the Virginia Tech shooting, not only assumed that the shooter was an Arab Muslim on no evidence, but continued to do so after the media reported that the shooter was Asian, on the grounds that it was possible that the American media had adopted the British convention of using &#8220;Asian&#8221; to indicate someone of Pakistani or Indian descent and were secretly covering up the Muslimicty of the attack.  Rationality is not really her forte.</p>

<p>Sure.  But the claim under consideration is not &#8220;there exist bad parents&#8221; but &#8220;there exist good parents who would have taken their 10-year-old child to an R-rated movie not aimed at children but for the rants of Deb Schlussel.&#8221;</p>

<p>I guess I am suspicious that her real worry is the children, given that her argument is in obvious bad faith with the focus on the liberal media teaching your children about lesbian whores.  (I agree not to trust the MPAA, but I also wouldn&#8217;t cite an R-rating as proof they were trying to get the 13-year-old demographic.  Action movies aim for PG-13 when they go after that group.)  </p>
<p>Perhaps this is how she critiques all movies, but I suspect that this is a case of not liking the message of <i>Watchmen</i> and finding reasons to bash it.</p>

						<p>I see your point, Charlieford, but let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a parent who has learned not to let the MPAA do the thinking for her, and she takes her children to this movie. That means she&#8217;s replaced letting the MPAA thinking for her with . . . <b>nobody</b> thinking for her. Not even her. The responsible way to get away from the rating system is to screen for oneself&#8211;otherwise there&#8217;s no discrimination at all.</p>
<p>Not to say it won&#8217;t happen&#8211;but it won&#8217;t be the fault of the filmmakers, the theater-owners, the MPAA, or the liberals (and I know you&#8217;re not blaming the libs). It will be the fault of the parents who have abdicated their powers of discrimination.</p>
<p>And that makes them unlikely converts to Schlusselism.</p>

						<p>&#8220;Don’t forget the but-for condition.&#8221;  As my reference to eric&#8217;s book implies, if we started with a realistic sense of how many minds we&#8217;d change, no one would write anything.  (In fact, I&#8217;m beginning to doubt the worth of writing this.)  But as I indicated in my original comment, I think &#8212; though I have few hard-data reasons for thinking so &#8212; that columns such as hers, together with others, contributes to an atmosphere of concern&#8211;or rather, a sense that people might be concerned, and affects the manner in which the gates get kept.  That&#8217;s where the action is (as I also indicated), or at least was.  Now days, with dvds, it hardly matters.</p>

						<p>Jason, again, I think columns such as hers do have an effect, though perhaps not primarily on parents.</p>
<p>As for this &#8212; &#8220;That means she’s replaced letting the MPAA thinking for her with . . . nobody thinking for her. Not even her. The responsible way to get away from the rating system is to screen for oneself–otherwise there’s no discrimination at all&#8221;&#8211; well its very nice, ideal even, in a kind of Ayn-Randian, exercise-your-personal-responsibility-and-stop-your-ridiculous-whining kind of way, but I do hope you know that, yes, pop-culture/youth-culture isn&#8217;t always the kind of thing every parent can easily navigate without the Debbie&#8217;s of the world.  Maybe some single mom out there is too worried about the lay-offs at her factory, and her mortgage, and etc., and maybe she&#8217;s exhausted and could use a few hours of break, and little Timmy wants to know if he can go with Jimmy and his older brother to see this.  If Debbie pops up when she googles it, she might learn exactly what she needs to know.</p>

						<p>Charlieford, I decided that I would take your supposition that D. Schlussel actually cares about children to heart.  So I went to find out what she thinks about the real threat of child poverty (which, I&#8217;ll assume we can agree affects more children than <i>Watchmen</i> ever will).  Google magic, presto:</p>
<p>Study: If Your Single Mom is a Ho, You&#8217;ll Be Delinquent<br />
By Debbie Schlussel</p>
<p>Those of us who&#8217;ve railed against slutty single moms who sleep around (like American Idol/Baby Momma, Fantasia) have more evidence to back up our views&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/archives/2007/03/study_if_your_s.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.debbieschlussel.com/archives/2007/03/study_if_your_s.html</a></p>
<p>Suffice to say, I am unconvinced that her care for children outweighs her cuckoo hatred.</p>
<p>Now, the real question may be this: why are we wasting our time with this nut job trying to make up possible conditions under which we may consider her a reasoned voice worth listening to?</p>

						<p>Charlieford, I get your worry, but I think if Deb had written something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know <i>Watchmen</i> isn&#8217;t marketed towards children particularly, and that it carries an R-rating, but parents who might think that it&#8217;s just a superhero movie and thus suitable for their pre-teens should be warned:  this film is definitely for adults only&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be complaining.  It&#8217;s the bad faith argument and the claim that any adult who sees it is okay with the brutal rape and murder of their own mother (?) that is bad.</p>

						<p><em>It seems to me you’ve been rather selective in your reprinting of what we have in this film. </em></p>
<p>Charlieford, I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Film_Is_Not_Yet_Rated" rel="nofollow"><em>This Film Is Not Yet Rated</em></a> and am familiar with the problems of the ratings system&#8212;I actually heard a talk by Matt Stone (!?!) about how <em>South Park</em> was cut, how he and Trey Parker deliberately inserted really vile material that they knew would push them into NC-17 territory just so they could go back the MPAA, say &#8220;We cut 49 minutes from the film, what more do you want from us?&#8221; and walk away with an uncompromised cut and an R-rating&#8212;but that wasn&#8217;t my point here.  I wasn&#8217;t selective as to what she objected to in the film, because the presence of <em>any one of those</em> warrants an R-rating.  I chose three representative examples of what earned it an R-rating.</p>
<p>I think if I&#8217;d titled the post &#8220;I watched gay porn and saw men having sex with other men!  What if a child saw this!?&#8221; my point would&#8217;ve been a bit clearer.  Moreover, all those incidents she complains about happen in context.  We&#8217;re not talking about the torture porn of the <em>Saw</em> franchise here&#8212;through the twisted portrait of Captain America that is the Comedian, Moore indicts the American military&#8217;s treatment of the Vietnamese, the pervasive sexism of military culture, &amp;c.  <em>That</em> is what Schlussel objected to, but which she can never admit to objecting to, because she&#8217;d rather not talk or even think about the American military in those terms.</p>
<p>(I hope this answers bitzer&#8217;s question too.)</p>

No is what I&#8217;m telling you. No. Now go play in traffic.&#8221;</p>

						<p>Debbie Downer warning said hypothetical mom away from the film is no problem at all.  It&#8217;s  a drag that in doing so she&#8217;d end up potentially getting credit (in the mom/dad&#8217;s eyes) for protecting their kid from the nakedblueliberalhollywoodfascistlesbianmenace(TM).  </p>
<p>The real drag tho is that the only way this movie was going to get made was as a movie capable of recuperating costs and more and that that virtually assured both making it and marketing it more like standard superhero flics.  So, the sawing off of hands stays, but Nite Owl can&#8217;t be chubby and can get it on. </p>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t to say that she&#8217;s honest about kids being a direct target of the marketing, but they&#8217;ll see it and some kids who shouldn&#8217;t see it will, and while this isn&#8217;t the end of the world it might mean bad dreams and more stressed out parents.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really confused by this, because in about half of the trailer, Nite Owl II looks like a demented Batman, buff and kicking ass, and in the other half, he&#8217;s the chubby nerdy guy with glasses.  Is all the ass-kicking merely in flashback?  Does his Batman suit make him thin?</p>

						<p><i>Oh good grief, learn to read, wouldja? Where did I ever say anything about Schlussel and what she cares about? I said columns such as hers can function in certain ways, but that’s irrespective of her intentions.</i></p>
<p>Charlieford, I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s worth arguing over, but here goes&#8230;  </p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that you didn&#8217;t say that Schlussel cares about children, and I apologize if I gave that impression.  It was, however, why I used the word &#8220;supposition&#8221; rather than &#8220;claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>You wrote, &#8220;People like this Debbie person, as regrettable as she may be, serve a function: they remind the theater owner to keep the gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, I think that this statement completely mischaracterizes the work that Schlussel&#8217;s screed really does.  I think that the piece has nothing to do with (a) film criticism and (b) child-raising.  The point of pieces like that is to galvanize a core group of retrograde homophobes and cultural conservatives, to whip them up into a lather about the threat that liberals, radicals, homosexuals and so on pose to children.  It is a tired trope that has been trotted out over and over in the past few decades (at least), but seemingly still effective.  The firm that ran the Prop 8 campaign basically said that the turning point in that battle was when they started running ads about teaching homosexuality in school, that is, they perversely made gay marriage a threat to children.</p>
<p>To grant any space to such work as either legitimate criticism or as a potentially useful warning for working families is, in my opinion, to blind oneself to the context and nature of her work.  It is to imagine an upside-down world in which Moore, the adapters of <i>Watchmen</i> and Hollywood in general are the threats to children and Schlussel is their savior.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize if my wording was unclear.  I was merely trying to highlight what was evil in her work and what your comments seemed, in my opinion, to downplay.</p>
<p>Good night and sweet dreams to you, also.</p>

						<p><i>Mommy, mommy, what’s a lesbian? What’s a whore?</i></p>
<p>I think its (not) funny that she&#8217;s more upset about having to explain lesbians and whores to kids than having to explain the fact that the women in the picture were brutally murdered.</p>
<p>But I also feel the need to toss in that I am frequently shocked by the movies people will show to young children. When I saw the first Spiderman movie in the theater I was pretty disturbed that little kids were watching someone get impaled. I&#8217;m not at all convinced that the MPAA ratings are useful in any way &#8211; in fact &#8211; I think they&#8217;re extremely problematic. But I do think a dialog about what kids watch on TV or in movies is actually important.</p>

						<p>Frankly, no one should watch this stuff. No one should make it. Never mind arguments about &#8216;will it make my kid a psycho&#8217;, or conservative moral outrage. The folks who make stuff like this should take a long, hard look at themselves and ask, &#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t I be a better person if I did something more life-affirming?&#8217; It&#8217;s not like it has a serious moral message or anything. </p>
<p>And don&#8217;t go all &#8216;Ooh, it&#8217;s &#8220;Watchmen&#8221; it&#8217;s iconic! Graphic novel! Graphic novel!&#8217; It&#8217;s a bloody comic. It just happens to be one written by someone with the kind of artistic pretensions we have to put up with far too much of these days.</p>
<p>Talking of which, I&#8217;ve been waiting 17 years now for Tarantino, for example, to make a film that wasn&#8217;t based around a rather disturbed teenage boy&#8217;s masturbation-fantasies. I still wait, judging from the trailer for his next artistic endeavour.</p>
<p>I mean, live and let live, I&#8217;m not saying ban it, but criminy, what does it say about us that it&#8217;s mainstream entertainment?</p>

						<p>Would you be offering this criticism if the movie weren&#8217;t based on a &#8220;comic book&#8221;?  Serious, non-snarky question.  Family-friendly movie-reviewers write lists like the one Charlieford quoted for all types of movies.  (That&#8217;s why the list puts Naked Dr. Manhattan up there as abhorrent as Rorschach&#8217;s actions.)  And while <i>Watchmen</i> is undoubtedly violent, the reviews notably haven&#8217;t excoriated it for being beyond the pale. Perhaps this says more about us, but it&#8217;s striking that this criticism seems to be applied more to <i>Watchmen</i> than many other films.</p>
<p><i>It’s not like it has a serious moral message or anything. </i></p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ll just disagree on this point, or at least, it&#8217;s possible, given the source material, that the movie is interesting ethically.  (Given the director, probably not.)  &#8220;Ooh, it&#8217;s iconic!&#8221; is a dumb defense, but &#8220;It&#8217;s based on a comic book, therefore it can&#8217;t be anything but pretentious&#8221; isn&#8217;t really a good offense.</p>

						<p>There is a genuine problem here, which is that &#8220;R&#8221; is a catch-all for a whole range of films that are very different in their content.</p>
<p>This film would appear to qualify for an NC-17 rating, which the MPAA defines as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;An NC-17 rated motion picture is one that, in the view of the Rating Board, most parents would consider patently too adult for their children 17 and under. No children will be admitted. NC-17 does not mean “obscene” or “pornographic” in the common or legal meaning of those words, and should not be construed as a negative judgment in any sense. The rating simply signals that the content is appropriate only for an adult audience. An NC-17 rating can be based on violence, sex, aberrational behavior, drug abuse or any other element that most parents would consider too strong and therefore off-limits for viewing by their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anything think that Watchmen isn&#8217;t &#8220;patently too adult for their children 17 and under&#8221;?  That it isn&#8217;t  &#8220;appropriate only for an adult audience&#8221;?  That it doesn&#8217;t contain scenes of &#8220;violence, sex, [and] aberrational behavior&#8230;too strong and therefore off-limits for viewing by &#8230; children&#8221;?</p>
<p>Why isnt&#8217; it rated NC-17?</p>
<p>Because most exhibitors won&#8217;t show NC-17 films.  The rating is considered equivalent to hard-core pornography and the multi-plexes won&#8217;t consider it.  It&#8217;s the kiss of death.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the multiplexes don&#8217;t mind at all showing explicit and detailed images of murder, mutilation, and sexual degredation &#8211; as long as they&#8217;re rated R.  Since viewers (expecially male teenagers and 20-somethings who go to the movies a lot) absolutely love this stuff, there&#8217;s tremendous financial pressure to give movies &#8220;R&#8221; ratings even though they should be rated NC-17.</p>
<p>So the &#8220;R&#8221; category has been expanded to cover everything from a little nudity and a handful of &#8220;fucks&#8221; or tokes on a bong to beheadings, dismemberments, rape-murders, and all the rest.</p>
<p>I often take my young teenaged children to &#8220;R&#8221; rated films. Slumdog Millionaire is rated R, and we saw that together.  Does anyone want to argue that Slumdog and Watchmen are comparably inappropriate for viewing by young teenagers?</p>
<p>Hate on Schlussel all you want.  That doesn&#8217;t make the &#8220;R&#8221; for Watchmen any more appropriate.</p>

						<p>Bloix- agreed.  I&#8217;d really rather they just not make the film than do the things they have to do to make it profitable, including working the rating downward.  </p>
<p>Of course I know that i&#8217;ve, so far, mounted a pretty harsh critique of a movie I haven&#8217;t seen yet, but I&#8217;m not hopeful that the book&#8217;s been handled well.  And, I could care less about it&#8217;s iconicity, dave. the book is thoughtful, harsh, ambiguous&#8230;it&#8217;s material I like.  I could give a fuck how iconic it is.</p>

I should have put an &#8220;and&#8221; after the agreed up there.  I know that isn&#8217;t the point you&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>slight caveat tho: I think that there&#8217;s alot of material that I could handle/did handle just fine at 16 that I don;t necessarily think is fine for 16 year olds in general.  Maybe this is hypocrisy, maybe everyone feels that way and that&#8217;s the problem, but kids the same chronolgical age vary greatly in levels of maturity.</p>

						<p><a href="http://www.kids-in-mind.com" rel="nofollow">This site is one of those family-friendly review sites</a>, where movies are explained in spoilery detail, and rated according to sex, violence, and profanity.  The violence in <i>Watchmen</i> is comparable, by this site&#8217;s metrics to <i>No Country for Old Men</i> and <i>300</i>, and edges out <i>The Dark Knight</i>.  (More nudity, but I am going to bet that the problem here isn&#8217;t really Dr. Manhattan&#8217;s blue nudity.)  Neither of which I would take a young child too (but I wouldn&#8217;t take them to Slumdog, either), but also neither the sort of movie that I think would indicate severe moral depravity on the part of the viewer.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone would deny that the R-rating is a very broad category, or that parents should do research when considering what movies to show their children.</p>

						<p>When I was growing up and was one of the young children Schlussel seeks to defend, I would not have been allowed to see this movie. As an older child-young adult, I read comics with some adult themes, and my parents were OK with this &#8212; they had taught their child to distinguish between reality and fantasy, and trusted me not to become mentally warped by tales of superheroics set against a more &#8220;realistic and gritty&#8221; background.<br />
When I was in college, I read Watchmen. I loved it. I found it to be a bit of a headache because of the amount of detail, I noticed a bit of misogyny, and it bummed me out to read about superheroes as fascists, but I thought it was incredibly well written and interesting.<br />
Every time I re-read it &#8212; and yes it is just as worthy of re-reads as Tolstoy, Faulkner, or any other great author&#8217;s work &#8211;I find something new, or gain a different insight.<br />
I don&#8217;t think Zack Snyder is going to live up to my first reading of the book, but if he can make a fraction of the commentary that Moore made about society, government, psychology, morality, duality, heroism and comic books (or films based on them) as a medium for story telling, then he&#8217;s done his job.<br />
This book is just as valid a lens on the concept of superheroes as Serpico is on crooked cops in the real world. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, right? I doubt we&#8217;d even be arguing about taking kids to see Serpico, and neither Watchmen the comic nor Watchmen the film is intended for a juvenile audience. It&#8217;s intended for grown ups who still enjoy or used to enjoy comic books, and want to enjoy an exploration of the subconscious desires and hidden mental illness that would drive someone to don a cape and cowl and beat on criminals. This is not &#8220;Superfriends,&#8221; and no one is claiming that it is.<br />
I&#8217;m certainly not saying kids should watch the Watchmen, or even be allowed to read the book, but when these kids who read comics grow up, I think this story would be something they&#8217;d enjoy, and something that will make them think.</p>

						<p>Almost the only tv watching I&#8217;ve been doing lately has been Disney Channel and Nickelodeon.  I feel like I have seen lots of ads for two movies, Watchmen and Escape to Witch Mountain the remake.  One of these is probably hitting its target audience, one is a cynical attempt to get my six year old daughter into a movie she has no business seeing.  Sometimes the crazy people get lucky and just happen to be right even if they write in all caps.  Somebody who is in charge of marketing Watchmen is targeting a completely inappropriate audience in ways that just make me sick.</p>

						<p>Thanks for that, Dave.  I like this:  &#8220;Sometimes the crazy people get lucky and just happen to be right even if they write in all caps.&#8221;  Also, sometimes we forget how kids get affected by things.  One of my daughters&#8211;she was maybe 8&#8211;was absolutely traumatized by watching the video of &#8220;The Incredible Shrinking Man,&#8221; the old&#8211;and wonderful!&#8211;&#8217;50s sci-fi flick.  She ran out of the room during the duel with the spider, and it wasn&#8217;t cute.  For several years after that she had &#8220;night terrors&#8221; (which of course I can&#8217;t be sure were connected, but, well, you know, we have our suspicions).  It was amazing how terrified she was; I never would have predicted it.  Another daughter at about the same age was terrified by watching &#8220;The Blob,&#8221; with Steve McQueen (yeah, we&#8217;re slow learners).  For several years she became a little frantic at bed time, running around, making sure all the doors were locked, all the windows closed, etc.  Now, some of this is just part of growing up.  There&#8217;s terrifying things out there and we can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t isolate children from all of them.  But I think adults if they don&#8217;t have kids often have a very abstract notion of how they react to things.</p>

						<p>Yes, and it&#8217;s a completely inappropriate audience that can&#8217;t drive, is for the most part too young to earn money working, and whose parents probably should know if they are or aren&#8217;t at a movie theater  watching R-rated films. Again, it&#8217;s a shame that kids see a commercial for what appears to be an ordinary superhero movie and think &#8220;I wanna watch this!&#8221; but as a parent, one can probably control access to this extremely adult-themed, (latex) costume drama.<br />
Maybe Disney shouldn&#8217;t be selling advertising time to adult-themed movies.</p>

<p>Your wording here indicates a nuance that this sentiment doesn&#8217;t generally contain, but it&#8217;s still there&#8211;you&#8217;re not a parent, so you can&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crap, of course&#8211;the usual, I mean. People understand how children try to manipulate their parents because they are former parent-manipulating children themselves&#8211;whether they&#8217;ve spawned or not.</p>
<p>Even people who grew up as non-manipulative kids were exposed to the manipulations through social interaction. This isn&#8217;t specialized knowledge.</p>

						<p><i>I think Rorschach will do in the general population exactly what he did in the comics community. He’ll seem to be disturbed at first, but actually come away unintentionally by the creators, as the hero of the piece.</i></p>
<p>This is the part that really freaks me out.  I see some connection between Rorschach and political conservatism, of course &#8211; but the idea that conservatives would *admit* it and try to *defend* Rorschach &#8211; that there are people *actually walking the streets* who think that being like Rorschach is a *good* thing &#8211; is more horrifying than any graphic novel or movie.</p>
<p>Rorschach does not &#8220;seem to be disturbed&#8221;.  Rorschach *is disturbed*.  There is no part of Rorschach&#8217;s mind that is healthy.  Actually, you could say that about a lot of characters &#8211; but *especially* Rorschach.</p>
<p>And, of course, there is no &#8220;hero of the piece&#8221;.  Anyone looking for a &#8220;hero of the piece&#8221; has so completely, totally, utterly missed the point, mere words cannot describe their failure of comprehension.</p>

<p>I’d echo Charlieford’s response. Yes and no. Yes, it’s crap if someone takes it to the absolute extreme of saying that people with children absolutely can’t understand what parents do. No, it’s not crap in saying that the understanding of people with children get rearranged by the experience. I didn’t understand pre-child in the same way as I do now, with child. Is that a superior understanding? In some ways, sure. In other ways, no. Is the childless understanding superior? In some ways, yes. In other ways, no.</p>
<p>But simply remembering your own manipulativeness is not the same thing as being on the other end of it.</p>
<p>(And by the way, simply saying “hey, responsible parents should stop their children from seeing this” is kind of a cop out. There are levels of “stopping” from “No, I won’t take you to this,” to “no, you can’t see this,” to “I will do everything in my power to prevent you from seeing this and if I find out that you went with friends without telling me there will be serious consequences.”)</p>

<p>Everything beyond this seems to be &#8220;I&#8217;m so busy, I can&#8217;t keep track of my spawn, my life is too important for blastocyst X to fall into order.&#8221;</p>

						<p>It&#8217;s ridiculous that anyone is defending this &#8216;think of the children&#8217; crap.  Zach Snyder is an incompetent, infantile director with a pitiful fetish for ultraviolence, and his inadequacies ruin a story that is brilliant in its original form&#8230; but that&#8217;s completely beside the point.  The movie telegraphs its nasty, dripping gothicness in its promotional material as best it can (obviously it&#8217;s barred from showing ALL the idiotic blood splatter and limb-breakage in its TV spots), it has an R rating, and there is not a single piece of mainstream text written about &#8216;Watchmen&#8217; that fails to include the phrase &#8220;not for children&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right that the MPAA&#8217;s rating system is so nebulous, but for Christ&#8217;s sake, you still obviously shouldn&#8217;t be taking your children to an R-rated film without expecting trouble (children are ably protected from their less-capable parents&#8217; stupidity here in Australia, where they can&#8217;t get into an &#8220;R18&#8221;-rated film at the cinema with or without said parents).  The general public, responsible parents included, can&#8217;t drop everything to babysit idiots (and there&#8217;s absolutely nothing &#8220;Randian&#8221; about asking them to see &#8212; or at least READ ABOUT &#8212; something as famously child-inappropriate as &#8216;Watchmen&#8217; before taking their kids to a showing), and the idea that they should is what&#8217;s so objectionable about Debbie Schussel and all the other sophists who use children to glorify their intrusion into art and media.</p>

						<p>ari- your comment made sense to me. Is that bad? The Christopher Walken of rock n&#8217; roll can still crank it out. His overt christianalism is bad enough, but racism too? So sad, but it still didn&#8217;t prevent me from attending an X show in Baltimore with my children. Am I a bad parent? Does your answer change if my kids are in their &#8217;20&#8217;s? They haven&#8217;t started preaching yet, but I&#8217;m alert to any abrupt changes in worldview.</p>
