		<p>So <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22017">wrote</a> Joan Didion&#8212;born on this day in 1934&#8212;on the eve of this year&#8217;s Presidential election.  Not that she found this evasion particularly shocking: &#8220;This was not an unpredictable occurence,&#8221; she wrote in 1998&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/699">Clinton Agonistes</a>.&#8221;  &#8220;These were not entirely unpredictable developments,&#8221; she writes in this month&#8217;s <em>New York Review of Books</em>.  The baseness of American politics may never surprise her, but the stupidity of the American electorate rarely fails to.  The object of her pithy restatements of talking points is never the political actor who mouths them (from whom nothing more nor better can be expected).  In these moments, the indictment is always of the public too stupid to recognize the absurdity of issues:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard repeatedly about &#8220;our children,&#8221; or &#8220;our kids,&#8221; who were, as presented, avid consumers of the <em>Nightly News </em>in whose presence sex had never been mentioned and discussions of the presidency were routine. (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375718907/diesekoschmar-20">Political Fictions</a> </em>233)</p>
<p>We could argue over whether or not the McCain campaign had sufficiently vetted its candidate for vice-president, but take at face value the campaign&#8217;s description of that vetting as &#8220;an exhaustive process&#8221; including a &#8220;seventy-question survey.&#8221; (&#8220;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22017">A Fateful Election</a>&#8220;)</p></blockquote>
<p>She does recognize the complicity of the press in this&#8212;what with its &#8220;arresting enthusiasm for overlooking the contradictions inherent in reporting that which only occurs in order to be reported&#8221; (<em>Political Fictions </em>30)&#8212;but the fault belongs less to the stewards of democracy and their flacks for behaving thus than to the public who willingly consumes it.  We are a deeply stupid republic, but as Didion quotes William Safire advising the Dukakis campaign, &#8220;We hate to be seen to be manipulated&#8221; (31).</p>
<p>This is typical Didion: frame the norm such that its absurdity becomes obvious, then crucify someone with their own words.  Safire, speaking on behalf of the American people, instead ridicules them.  Bob Woodward, attempting to establish his thoroughness, instead reveals his methodological commitment to a scrupulous passivity untainted by thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>The discinclination of Mr. Woodward&#8217;s to exert cognitive energy on what he is told reaches critical mass in <em>The Choice</em>, where not much is said to the author by a candidate or potential candidate appears to have been deemed too insignificant for inclusion, too casual for documentation.  (&#8220;Most of them permitted me to tape-record the interviews, otherwise I took detailed notes.&#8221;) (<em>Political Fictions</em> 196)</p></blockquote>
<p>Didion&#8217;s prose here embodies the very principle it defends: Woodward&#8217;s inclusion of irrelevance is proven through the judicious selection of his most irrelevant sentence.  No fat need (nor <em>can</em>) be trimmed from its meat.  This otherwise laudable feature has drawbacks (to more than the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/this_afternoon_.html">the would-be parodist</a>) apparent when <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/didion.htm">inevitable tragedies occur</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nine months and five days ago, at approximately 9 o&#8217;clock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child, Quintana, then 37, had been for the previous five nights unconscious in an intensive-care unit at Beth Israel Medical Center&#8217;s Singer Division, at that time a hospital on East End Avenue (it closed in August 2004), more commonly known as &#8220;Beth Israel North&#8221; or &#8220;the old Doctors&#8217; Hospital,&#8221; where what had seemed a case of December flu sufficiently severe to take her to an emergency room on Christmas morning had exploded into pneumonia and septic shock. This is my attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.</p>
<p>I have been a writer my entire life. As a writer, even as a child, long before what I wrote began to be published, I developed a sense that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences and paragraphs, a technique for withholding whatever it was I thought or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish. The way I write is who I am, or have become, yet this is a case in which I wish I had instead of words and their rhythms a cutting room, equipped with an Avid, a digital editing system on which I could touch a key and collapse the sequence of time, show you simultaneously all the frames of memory that come to me now, let you pick the takes, the marginally different expressions, the variant readings of the same lines. This is a case in which I need more than words to find the meaning. This is a case in which I need whatever it is I think or believe to be penetrable, if only for myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key clause there&#8212;the moment when her prose betrays itself and lays its innards bare&#8212;speaks to how her daughter and husband&#8217;s death &#8220;cut loose any fixed idea [she] ever had.&#8221;  For Didion, fixed ideas are <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/new_post_by_yt_.html">so much fat to be trimmed</a> and, needless to say, self-butchery is neither clean nor painless.</p>

						<p>An appreciation for what?  What we have hear is a string of unconnected rather portentious sounding Didion quotes.  </p>
<p>At least regarding quotes that you picked out about the political process, I don&#8217;t even think that Didion is right.  Declaring the public stupid is the kind of move that the young and pompous National Review incarnation of Didion would have made and, the fact that she was still doing this in her 60s and 70s speaks to her discredit.</p>

						<p>aren&#8217;t you in a mood, gerald.  didion is a wonderful writer, but perhaps not best captured in snippets.  </p>

						<p>Can I cancel my own goddam subscription too?  One should never, <i>ever</i> express appreciation of anybody who ever wrote anything for National Review.  Including Theodore Sturgeon &#8212; even if he <i>was</i> one of best SF writers of his generation, and even if he <i>did</i> write a pretty good SF satire of McCarthyism, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=paU7_b7dQqYC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=Mr.+Costello,+hero&amp;ei=rUU6SZnhBobWlQSZ45FO#PPA335,M1" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Mr. Costello, Hero&#8221;</a>.  There&#8217;s just no excuse.</p>
<p>Ha ha, shorter Joan Didion on her family tragedies: &#8220;Having family die and/or get deathly ill on you around the holidays is inexpressibly sad, at least when you have to use words, therefore what happened to my husband and daughter would&#8217;ve been better made into movie, with the various alternatives for the crucial scenes previewed by sample audiences in some of the more representative film-going markets around the country.  Or should we try it out at Sundance, first?&#8221;</p>
<p>I write this because I hate Joan Didion now.  Which is odd, because I thought she was great just a couple minutes ago.  Then someone said &#8220;National Review&#8221; and her name and . . . oh, wait, I see I&#8217;ve blown my dosage schedule for those anti-convulsants again . . . .</p>

						<p>I was reading the &#8220;When inevitable tragedies occur&#8221; link, and had to leave it for a while.  The intensity is quite oppressive.  This really speaks to the power of language.  One can use the cheap trick of attempting to sway the reader with emotionally charged verbiage &#8211; what John Gardener calls the flaw of sentimentality.  Or, one can describe with simple, straightforward prose and let the power of the ideas dominate.  Clearly, Didion chooses the latter approach.  </p>
<p>Random thoughts follow:</p>
<p>My simple mind, in a fit of triviality, fixated approvingly on one of her husband&#8217;s last statements &#8211; that one shouldn&#8217;t mix single malt Scotch.</p>
<p>Regarding the stupidity of the American public, Dubya got a second term.  QED.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t hate someone for merely having been published in NR &#8211; at least not without reading the actual articles first.  Not that that is likely to happen any time soon . . .</p>

						<p>Didion nowhere in her linked essay calls the public stupid.  That&#8217;s SEK&#8217;s misreading of Didion, which &#8212; just about replicating the phenomenon she describes &#8212; replaces what Didion actually wrote in the minds of this thread&#8217;s commentariat.</p>
<p>What Didion describes is a failure to come to grips with reality &#8212; the theme of all her writing, even when that failure is her own.  We &#8212; notice, *we*, not *you* &#8212; prefer the easy controversy, the easy question, the easy problem.  Not because we&#8217;re stupid; Didion doesn&#8217;t offer an explanation for our amnesia in the essay.  Rather, based on her other writing, that just seems to be how the human mind prefers to work.  And the journalists whose duty it should be to turn our minds towards reality, instead cater to our preference for amnesia.</p>

						<p>Joan Didion&#8217;s Miami was exactly the book I needed to read as a young, literal-minded lefty during the Reagan years. It added much-needed depth (embarrassingly so) to my understanding of my home-state politics. I&#8217;ve loved her ever since.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been afraid to read Magical Thinking, though. It came out shortly after my father&#8217;s death, and the last thing I wanted was &#8220;depth,&#8221; much-needed or not. In fact, I still prefer wading safely in the shallows.</p>
<p>But, back when everyone I knew was happy and healthy, I loved a good book about death. May I recommend a couple others?</p>
<p>Harold Brodkey&#8217;s This Wild Darkness: The Story of my Death.</p>
<p>And Anatole Broyard&#8217;s Intoxicated by My Illness.</p>
<p>Broyard&#8217;s book had a particularly amazing (to me) insight about our response to death. When his father is dying, Broyard is overwhelmed by his desire to bed his father&#8217;s nurse, and basically just because she was nearby. (I haven&#8217;t re-read this since prior to 2003, but that&#8217;s how I remember it.)</p>
<p>Similarly, when my friend&#8217;s dad died, just before mine, my friend&#8217;s sister got pregnant immediately and without regard to what she would have previously considered highly inappropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>And when my brother&#8217;s friend&#8217;s dad died at around the same time, my brother&#8217;s friend started a family immediately.</p>
<p>And when our own dad died, and we were cleaning out his apartment, my brother and I, both single, turned to each other and said, &#8220;I want to have a kid, like, today.&#8221; It hasn&#8217;t happened for me, but my brother started a family soon after, and I now have a little nephew.</p>

						<p>I reluctantly second Gerald&#8217;s frustration with the post.  If I got this from a student, I&#8217;d be all over it:  &#8220;What&#8217;s the thesis here?  What are you trying to say?  Do you think you&#8217;ve done a good job saying it?  If this hadn&#8217;t been written by you, would YOU want to read it?&#8221;  Some of the fault may derive (as SEK almost indicates) from reading Didion&#8217;s mushy prose, which is loaded with hints at supposedly known-only-with-difficulty significances, but avoids declaring them forthrightly:  “These were not,&#8221; says she, &#8220;entirely unpredictable developments.”  Wow.  Now there&#8217;s something you could say every day, about everything.  But it sounds&#8211;especially with the inclusion of that &#8220;entirely&#8221;&#8211;like some kind of rare discovery, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

						<p>I agree that the thesis wasn&#8217;t clear in the post, but I liked the post anyway.  And this &#8220;“Having family die and/or get deathly ill on you around the holidays is inexpressibly sad, at least when you have to use words, therefore what happened to my husband and daughter would’ve been better made into movie, with the various alternatives for the crucial scenes previewed by sample audiences in some of the more representative film-going markets around the country. Or should we try it out at Sundance, first?”&#8221; is so far from an accurate accounting of The Year of Magical Thinking that the failure to understand is, actually, inexpressibly sad.</p>
<p>(I read The Year of Magical Thinking not long after my mom died.  Nothing else I read so perfectly described the curious and irrational ways our brains react to the sudden absence of someone we care deeply about.)</p>

						<p>Gerald:</p>
<p><em>Declaring the public stupid is the kind of move that the young and pompous National Review incarnation of Didion would have made and, the fact that she was still doing this in her 60s and 70s speaks to her discredit.</em></p>
<p>She also hated hippies:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were seeing the desperate attempt of a handful of pathetically unequipped children to create a community in a social vacuum . . . . As it happens I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one&#8217;s self depends upon one&#8217;s mastery of language, and I am not optimistic about children who will settle for saying, to indicate that their mother and father do not live together, that they come from &#8220;a broken home.&#8221;  They are sixteen, fifteen, fourteen years old, younger all the time, an army of children waiting to be given words. (<em>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</em> 122).</p></blockquote>
<p>Nor was she fond of Marxist-Leninists:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Michael Laski] is rigidly committed to an immutable complex of doctrine, including the notions that the traditional Communist Party is a &#8220;revisionist bourgeois clique,&#8221; that the Progressive Labor Party, the Trotskyites, and &#8220;the revisionist clique headed by Gus Hall&#8221; prove themselves opportunistic bourgeois lackeys by making their peace appeal not to the &#8220;workers&#8221; but to the liberal imperalists . . . . The world Michael Laski had constructed for himself was one of labyrinthine intricacy and immaculate clarity, a world made meaningful not only by high purpose but by external and internal threats, intrigues and apparatus, an immutably ordered world in which things mattered. (<em>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</em> 63, 65)</p></blockquote>
<p>But she did write reviews of contemporary literature for <em>National Review</em> for three years in the early &#8217;60s (and her early 20s), long before it embraced neoconservatives and clowns like Jonah Goldberg.  (Off with her head!)  And she did so in clean, measured prose&#8212;witness the patient weariness of the last sentences in both paragraphs above.  (Fuck the stump!)  So who are we to disagree with the parenthetical pitchfork-wielding mob?</p>
<p>Brad: That comment&#8217;s going on the fridge next to my Ph.D.</p>
<p>jazzbumpa: They&#8217;re all book reviews, of which <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback200604180656.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> is both free and representative.  </p>
<p>Anderson:</p>
<p><em>Didion nowhere in her linked essay calls the public stupid.</em></p>
<p>And nowhere in my post did I say she did.  </p>
<p><em>What Didion describes is a failure to come to grips with reality&#8212;the theme of all her writing, even when that failure is her own.</em></p>
<p>I said as much in the post w/r/t <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em> and fixed ideas, so I&#8217;m not sure where we&#8217;re disagreeing here. </p>
<p><em>Didion doesn’t offer an explanation for our amnesia in the essay.</em></p>
<p>In that essay, no, but in others&#8212;as with the bit about the New Left from &#8220;Slouching Toward Bethlehem&#8221; and throughout <em>Political Fictions</em>&#8212;she does.  </p>
<p>Michael:</p>
<p><em>Joan Didion’s Miami was exactly the book I needed to read as a young, literal-minded lefty during the Reagan years. It added much-needed depth (embarrassingly so) to my understanding of my home-state politics. I’ve loved her ever since.</em></p>
<p>No need to be embarrassed: everyone has to learn something sometime, and the younger the better.  My first taste of local California history came from <em>Where I Was From</em>, and I didn&#8217;t read that until well after I moved to California and was only young at heart (if even).</p>
<p>Charlieford:</p>
<p><em>“What’s the thesis here? What are you trying to say? Do you think you’ve done a good job saying it? If this hadn’t been written by you, would YOU want to read it?”</em></p>
<p>Are posts supposed to have theses?  Are appreciations?  Because many of my posts are occasional, totally without theses, and most appreciations attempt to convey a sense of what&#8217;s being appreciated.  This isn&#8217;t to say there&#8217;s no thesis up there, as I thought I did a decent job demonstrating that what separates Didion from The Average Writer isn&#8217;t merely the clarity of her prose, but her willingness to turn her withering intellect on herself when the circumstances dictate it.</p>

						<p>SEK, if you could read &#8220;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&#8221; and your takeaway was &#8220;Didion hated hippies,&#8221; then I don&#8217;t really know what else to say to you about Didion.  I mean, damn.</p>
<p>And, good lord &#8212; compare this</p>
<p><i>The world Michael Laski had constructed for himself was one of labyrinthine intricacy and immaculate clarity, a world made meaningful not only by high purpose but by external and internal threats, intrigues and apparatus, an immutably ordered world in which things mattered.</i></p>
<p>&#8212; with the first two pages of &#8220;The White Album,&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see that what fascinated her about Laski was precisely that his world *did* make sense, a quality she both envied and despised, quite self-consciously in both regards.</p>

						<p>SEK, I guess you&#8217;ve answered your own question.  (I was going to say, I don&#8217;t know if it has to be, you know, a &#8220;thesis&#8221; a la Abelard or whatever, and &#8220;need&#8221; implies &#8220;should&#8221; so . . . better see the &#8220;expressivism&#8221; thread on that . . . but as a general rule I do think if we&#8217;re saying something it&#8217;s nice to have something to say, and unless we&#8217;re Hegel, it shouldn&#8217;t be needlessly difficult to determine what it is.)  I now see what you were doing, but, I have to confess, after reading it a few times I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to say for sure if it was an appreciation, or depreciation, or what any parts of it had to do with the others.  But maybe that&#8217;s just me.</p>

						<p>Um, rosmar, I was being sarcastic, and at Gerald&#8217;s expense.  Now, I&#8217;ll grant, even <i>that</i> might be considered inexpressibly sad, but not for the reasons you thought.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/103/didion-per-harrison.html" rel="nofollow">longest Didion-hate I&#8217;ve found so far</a> has a wonderful bit of found near-doggerel (yes, I supplied the line breaks:</p>
<p>Lucille Maxwell Miller is convicted &#8212;<br />
by Didion &#8211; &#8211;<br />
of wearing polyester and Capris,<br />
of living in a house with a snack bar<br />
and a travertine entry,<br />
of speaking in cliches,<br />
of having a picture window and a family room<br />
and a husband nicknamed Cork,<br />
of frequenting the Kapu-Kai Restaurant-Bar and Coffee Shop,<br />
and of never having eaten an artichoke.</p>
<p>The same essay also contains the pithiest hate I&#8217;ve ever read on the subject.  Glorio Steinem called out to a journalist on her way to intervew Didion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 &#8220;Ask her how come, if she spends all her time crying and swimming and struggling to open a car door, she finds the energy to write so much?&#8221;)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why?  Perhaps because (as in the case of Theodore Sturgen, who resisted writing like nobody else alive) with some writers it just starts happening and you can&#8217;t stop, like topping a hillcrest and starting down only to realize your brakes are gone, and then you have no choice but to steer, eyes wide, knuckles white, until it&#8217;s over.  You can develop an extraordinarily defensive driving style after only a few such experiences, and, for lack of any other way to discriminate rapidly enough among the pedestrians you&#8217;ll inevitably mow down on your long, twisty, brakeless descent, you decide you might as steer toward the ones with most glaringly obvious deficiencies of taste.  Is it unjust?  Of course.  But any system of justice requires fixed ideas, fixed ideas have also killed lots of people, so why not just report your visceral reactions to people and their choices with the same dry objectivity that you report names and dates?  And besides, nobody died anyway, because this is all just metaphor, these are just words, even fixed ideas are only known through their verbal expression.  Fixed ideas don&#8217;t kill people.  People kill people.  Didion doesn&#8217;t convict anybody.  She just writes about them.</p>

As I read The Year of Magical Thinking, all I could think was, here is a person who is terrified that when her husband died, her own establishment-granted privilege died too. The book was a plea to the powers that be not to forget that she could get Knicks tickets from the NBA commissioner on demand. Then they turned it into a Broadway play. But to her credit, she convinced me that I could find personal tragedies beautiful even when they happened to someone I thought very unlikable.</p>
