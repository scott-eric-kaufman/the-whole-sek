		<p>In the comments to Eric&#8217;s post about <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/best-underrated-historical-novel/">underrated historical novels</a>, I <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/best-underrated-historical-novel/#comment-52406">pointed out</a> that there is a problem with talking about the &#8220;historical novel&#8221; as a self-evident genre.  I did not, however, go into much detail as to why, because I covered the topic on my qualifying exams and the less said about that experience the better.  But since Eric <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/best-underrated-historical-novel/#comment-52407">asked so nicely</a>, I will oblige and show you why this discussion&#8217;s so painfully tangled.</p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> Its knots all sport thorns.</p>
<p><strong>Long pedantic version:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-11193"></span></p>
<p>The most basic definition of the historical novel is situational: if the moment the novel represents occurs prior to the moment in which it is written, the novel is historical.  The conceptual problem with this definition is its expansiveness: any novel not written about the perpetual present or the future will be historical so long as it is sufficiently realist.  (More on the necessity of limiting this discussion to realist novels shortly.) However, as the identifying characteristics of a given period become visible through age&#8212;think smile-lines or wrinkled foreheads&#8212;even those works set in the perpetual present become dated.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394726413/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Bright Lights, Big City</em></a> was a novel <em>of</em> the 1980s when it was published in 1984; now, it reads like an historical novel <em>about</em> the 1980s, for the simple reason that any novel that sufficiently captures a <em>zeitgeist</em> also documents it for it future generations.  Such novels become a sort of historical artifact whose usefulness depends on the acuity and fidelity of their documentation: a perceptive author deeply indebted to the realist tradition will record an immense quantity of high-quality period detail. This being the case, these novelists of the perpetual present belong to a more anthropological than historical tradition.  An obvious distinction, but one which must be made lest we claim that all realist novels are historical by dint of being old.</p>
<p>So then, the historical novel is not historical because it belongs to history, but because its author makes a concerted effort to address historical material in a realist mode.  It may seem odd to confine historical novels within the realist movement, but if we define the genre attitudinally&#8212;if the sole criterion for inclusion is a dogged historical disposition&#8212;our reckoning must include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141182806/diesekoschmar-20">modernist novels</a> that, though obsessed with history, nevertheless fail to conform to the fuzzy notion of the historical novel we&#8217;re refining here. Not that there aren&#8217;t some modernist works, like John Dos Passos&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883011140/diesekoschmar-20"><em>U.S.A.</em></a> trilogy, that warrant inclusion, but they do so on the basis of being &#8220;realist enough,&#8221; and in so doing confirm our belief that the historical novel is a subset of realism&#8212;or better yet, a mode of the realist genre that entails a particular distance from and attitude towards historical events.  This means that historical romances like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192817639/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Rob Roy</em></a>&#8212;written in 1817 about the England and Scotland in 1715&#8212;are excluded, but early realist novels like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883011884/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Huck Finn</em></a>&#8212;written in 1884 about events in 1840 or thereabout&#8212;squeeze in.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that most people would include <em>Rob Roy</em> and exclude <em>Huck Finn</em>&#8212;the former on the basis of its reliance of historical events and personages, the latter because Mark Twain made it all up and novels consisting of unadulterated fictions are not rightly called historical.  Of course, not all of <em>Huck Finn</em> is an invention: the time and its quarrels, the people and their prejudices, and the river and its course are all faithfully recreated in the novel, but somehow that is not enough to convince our gut that <em>Huck Finn</em> deserves to be called an historical novel.  However, the desire to include <em>Rob Roy</em> speaks to another defining characteristic of historical novels: the presence of historical events and personages.  It also demonstrates that their presence alone is insufficient&#8212;the narrative in which they appear must conform to a realist ethos or we risk including rousing yarns of how George Washington single-handedly defeated the Hessians with egg yolk and a tuning folk.</p>
<p>Historical novels, then, must depict historical events and personages while adhering to a realist ethos: its narrative need not be historically <em>faithful</em>, but at a minimum it must be historically <em>plausible</em>.  Plausibility matters so much that even novels about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553560735/diesekoschmar-20">far-flung futures</a> can make a case for being historical novels.  This is why, to my mind, categorizing historical novels according to their modal characteristics is more productive than doing so by their content.  It may seem odd to say that the defining characteristic of historical novels is something other than their historical content, but categorizing them according to the manner in which that content is addressed allows us to include novels relating to present (Dreiser&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931082316/diesekoschmar-20"><em>An American Tragedy</em></a>) or future (Robinson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553560735/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Red Mars</em></a>) histories and exclude novels whose manifest historical content is overwhelmed by romantic conventions (Scott&#8217;s <em>Rob Roy</em>) or implausible heroics (Weir Mitchell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1417992077/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker: Sometime Brevet Lt. Col. of His Excellency General Washington</em></a>).</p>
<p>In sum, defining the historical novel as a realist mode allows us to include the works we want to and exclude the ones we don&#8217;t and by &#8220;we,&#8221; of course, I mean &#8220;I.&#8221;  You&#8217;re more than welcome to disagree, which is what my committee, none too impressed that I&#8217;d argued <em>Rob Roy</em> into the ether, did during my qualifying exams.  Their main objections concerned my reliance on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">pornographic</a> notion of plausibility and an insufficiently articulated idea that historical novels address social evolution.  If you&#8217;ve read this far, you know that I&#8217;ve again neglected to articulate that idea in the body of my argument, only this time I did so for a reason: it allows novels I&#8217;ve booted from the porch sneak back in through the barn.  If I designate &#8220;the depiction of social evolution&#8221; to be a defining characteristic of the historical novel, <em>Rob Roy</em> and <em>Huck Finn</em> are back in; but if I claim that the depiction is incidental because it is impossible to accurately track historical developments forward in time without also capturing the response of a society to those developments, <em>Rob Roy</em> and <em>Huck Finn</em> are still out . . . which is where I believe they belong.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;ll simply repeat my comment from the last thread on this subject. Not because it&#8217;s brilliant but because it is a simple starting point.<br />
Clear lines between historical novels and novels set in history are difficult to distinguish. The historical novelist may create dialog, internal thoughts, and fill in the blanks as it were but their principal characters, place, and time are bound by the known historical record. Novels set in history are primarily works of the imagination and are not bound by anything more than the storyteller’s imagination. They may be set in specific times and places and encounter persons of history but the author feels no need to accurately reflect the historical record. For example, the James Welch novels are wonderful, but are they historical novels or novels set in history? What about Pete Dexter’s Deadwood or Ron Harrison’s exceptional “outlaw” novels?  I’m not sure. However, I do believe that John Vernon’s The Last Canyon would fit as would Mari Sandoz’s Cheyenne Autumn. Both Vernon and Sandoz’s work, while excellent, feel somewhat stilted and bound by the press of history. While, Welch, Dexter, and Hanson’s stories seems much freer as works, primarily, of the imagination. Wow, I managed to work in some recommendations along with my prattle.</p>

						<p><em>Clear lines between historical novels and novels set in history are difficult to distinguish.</em></p>
<p>This is even more difficult when you factor in the question &#8220;When does history begin?&#8221;  Does <em>The Ice Storm</em>, written in 1994 about the 1970s, qualify as historical?  How much time has to pass before something becomes historical?  (You&#8217;ll note that I side-step that issue entirely by focusing on historical novels as a mode instead of discussing its relationship to its content.)</p>
<p><em>They may be set in specific times and places and encounter persons of history but the author feels no need to accurately reflect the historical record.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d go even further: for a novel to be historical, its author must <em>appear</em> motivated to reflect the historical record accurately.  So, in the case of <em>Red Mars</em>, its various narrators all refer to the past Kim Stanley Robinson invented with respect, so it&#8217;s an historical novel about the future colonization of Mars.  (Admittedly, this sort of categorization scheme isn&#8217;t likely to fly for historians, who are more concerned with the relationship of content to form than the formal and generic properties of the text, but it suits me fine.)</p>

						<p>I would add that in the earlier thread on historical novels, Buster suggested Wallace Stegner&#8217;s Angle of Repose. It is a brilliant novel and one of my favorites. It is also controversial due to Stegner&#8217;s decision to create a fictional character, Susan Burling Ward, in place of Mary Hallock Foote whose life is the bedrock of this novel. I believe an important reason for Stegner’s decision was his desire not to be constrained by the conventions of the historical novel. He chose instead the freedom of placing his fictional character in history.</p>

						<p>I think I&#8217;d exclude novels about the history of fictional futures.  If the period of time itself is fictional, that to me would seem to disqualify it.</p>
<p>I also think that realism (at least as you seem to be using the term here) is the wrong way to think about it, because I can think of a bad historical novel that was bad because it got important facts wrong or misinterpreted them, yet would still count as a historical novel.</p>
<p>A historical novel I would say takes the period of time or event as its <i>telos</i>, even if there are really memorable characters or considerable embellishments.  The point is the history, not the characters.  A good one does it well and succeeds in informing the reader about the time period.</p>

						<p><em>If the period of time itself is fictional, that to me would seem to disqualify it.</em></p>
<p>Is the future really fictional?  Especially when it&#8217;s based on Mars colonization studies from countless academic disciplines&#8212;economics, psychology, political science, pretty much every one of the hard sciences&#8212;which is, when you think about it, the same sort of research that novelist who wanted to write a novel about labor unrest in Ragtown during the construction of the Hoover Dam.  The only difference, as I see it, is that Robinson&#8217;s research into the psychological profiles and interpersonal dynamics of the first colonists means that he wouldn&#8217;t base his characters&#8217; motivations and reactions on his own (and speculations derived therefrom).</p>
<p><em>I also think that realism (at least as you seem to be using the term here) is the wrong way to think about it, because I can think of a bad historical novel that was bad because it got important facts wrong or misinterpreted them, yet would still count as a historical novel.</em></p>
<p>Sorry about that.  I always forget that every discipline does its own dance with that term.  What I mean by realism is &#8220;literary realism,&#8221; <em>i.e.</em> that mid-to-late-Nineteenth Century development of the novel that emphasized a focus on the ordinary details of contemporary life: think <em>Middlemarch</em> or <em>The Rise of Silas Lapham</em> or <em>La Comédie Humaine</em>.  It is, essentially, the default novelistic mode today&#8212;we don&#8217;t see many naturalists nor, for that matter, many authors with an inflexible aesthetic commitment to a pessimistic determinism.  The whole bit about literature being a window&#8212;with modernist prose being stained glass, calling attention to itself while obscuring the larger world, and realist prose being a spotless pane, allowing the reader to see clear through to the subject matter outside&#8212;captures the sense in which I use the term.  (That said, the vaunted transparency of realist prose is illusory: it only reads smoothly because we&#8217;ve been trained to read realist prose.)  Point being: it doesn&#8217;t matter, per my formulation, whether the historical detail corresponds to reality so long as it can be plausibly thought to.   </p>
<p><em>The point is the history, not the characters. A good one does it well and succeeds in informing the reader about the time period.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I mean by emphasizing the author&#8217;s attitude.  Does he or she endeavor to capture the sense of a time and place?  If so, the book will read like an historical novel regardless of whether the events it narrates are historical fact, as with the counter- and alternate-histories.</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;re muddling, or responding to the muddled nature of a few things.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the term, &#8220;historical fiction&#8221; as it&#8217;s commonly used, which is approximately equivalent to the way that the term &#8220;period&#8221; is used in film.  That is, it&#8217;s work by an author writing in one time and place, self-consciously trying to set a story within another time and possibly place.  The complicating factor here is that some writers set their works in earlier periods while others make their works *about* those earlier times and places.  This is a question of degree, rather than in or out, yes or no.  Some novels are set within history, while others are about history.  The comparison the comes to mind is between Toni Morrison&#8217;s novels and August Wilson&#8217;s plays.  Morrison sets her works in a historical setting and is concerned with the opportunities and constraints that operated in that setting.  Wilson&#8217;s plays are fundamentally about history.  Neither is reductively historical, but they have a different mode of engagement with disciplinary history.</p>
<p>A second definition of &#8220;historical fiction&#8221; is the one that was effectively operating in that other thread: historical fiction as fiction that engages with our imagination of historical settings, either individually or pedagogically, whether they were composed roughly contemporaneously to the history they capture or with the benefit of professional research/hindsight.  As you note, some works lend themselves to this more than others (<i>Bright Lights, Big City</i> was so zeitgeistrific that it felt like a historical novel by the time it was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094799/" rel="nofollow">made into a movie</a> in 1988).  Here I think your &#8220;realist enough&#8221; line is on the right track.  I would argue that Ben Okri&#8217;s <i>The Famished Road</i> is one of the best historical fictions at capturing the late-colonial/early nationalist period in West Africa, despite a story-telling mode that Latin Americanists tend to call magical realism and the Harry Garuba has argued should be called animist materialism (Garuba, Harry. &#8220;Explorations in Animist Materialism: Notes on Reading/Writing African Literature, Culture, and Society.&#8221; <i>Public Culture</i> 15, no. 2 (2003): 261-85).</p>
<p>The third category is not necessarily historical fiction in either of these senses, but is historical work that we (you and I, but mostly you) do with fiction.  Fiction as a historical heuristic about both the time in which it was produced and possibly that time&#8217;s imagination of other times.</p>
<p>The fourth would be your category of imagined or invented histories.  Like dana, I&#8217;m somewhat skeptical here.  I can see from the literary point of view the usefulness of equating an imagined future history to the imaginative work of engaging with historical memory or disciplinary history to the invention of an alternate of self-contained history (a la <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and such like).  They&#8217;re all engagements with the idea or formal qualities of historical narrative.  At the same time, I could see good literary reasons to make a distinction between this abstract sense of history and with fiction that wants to engage with history <i>wie es eigentlich gewesen ist</i>, whatever level of fidelity or consistency it actually achieves.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s enough for tonight.</p>

						<p>&#8220;In the comments to Eric’s post about underrated historical novels, I pointed out that there is a problem with talking about the “historical novel” as a self-evident genre&#8221;</p>
<p>There are problems with the entire concept of &#8220;genres&#8221; of literature, beyond being a convenience of commericial publishing, actually.  </p>
<p>I was just pointing out elsewhere <a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2005/01/chip-delany-on-genre.html" rel="nofollow">this old post of mine</a>, which itself reprinted a Usenet comment of mine from 2000, which itself reprinted some comments from Samuel R. Delany, professor of literature, and author (and sometime friend of mine) made in an interview at a long defunct website, on the problematic nature of genre definitions.</p>
<p>Sample quote:<br />
<blockquote> [&#8230;]  What can not be defined are ge­nres. You can&#8217;t define poetry, the novel, traged­y, pornography, comics&#8230; and you cannot defi­ne academic criticism either. Now, you can de­scribe all of them in perfectly useful ways. You ­can describe them so people can recognize them­. So that particular provisional job that you h­ave to do can get done. You just can not specify the­ir necessary and sufficient conditions. So th­ere are no root examples, no borderline cases. Wit­h different descriptions, different borderli­nes come into being. I think the genre or at least ­genre criticism, might take a major step forward­ if it simply threw out the term &#8220;definition.&#8221; Th­e term &#8220;description,&#8221; would do perfectly well.  </p></blockquote>
<p> I&#8217;m sure Chip Delany has written about this more formally elsewhere, but I don&#8217;t have currently have accessible any of his collections of criticisms, so that post will have to do for my quoting him for now.</p>
<p>My own comment is that &#8220;defining&#8221; genres can be a fun parlor game, and I have no doubt that people can get theses out of it, but it&#8217;s a practice one should take up seriously.  </p>
<p>(Though if someone gets a thesis out of it, hey, good for them.)</p>
<p>Whatever the &#8220;genre.&#8221;</p>

						<p>&#8220;In sum, defining the historical novel as a realist mode allows us to include the works we want to and exclude the ones we don’t and by &#8216;we,&#8217; of course, I mean &#8216;I.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and on that, while I&#8217;m getting hairy palms by self-linking, see <a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-damon-knight-actually-said-about.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.  (Hint: 95% of people who quote Damon Knight misquote him.)</p>

						<p>Incidentally, Potter&#8217;s statement in <i>Mapp</i> was written in 1964.  Damon Knight&#8217;s was written prior to 1956.  (I used to be able to look up the exact date of the original fanzine, but can&#8217;t at present; sometime in the late Forties, as I recall.)</p>
<p>And let me also say: &#8220;This is why, to my mind, categorizing historical novels according to their modal characteristics is more productive than doing so by their content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same for any and all genres.  This is the point Chip was making, which I, unnecessarily, second.</p>

						<p>More seriously, I picked up a distinction between &#8220;historical&#8221; and &#8220;period&#8221; somewhere. &#8220;Historical&#8221; meaning something close to your definition &#8211; realist(ic), real historical figures, about real historical events (though fictionalized) &#8211; and &#8220;period&#8221; meaning also set in the past, but with no or only incidental mention of real historical figures, centered around fictional characters involved in wholly fictional plots.</p>

						<p>The same problem comes up in film theory:  What&#8217;s costume drama?  I think that an adequate theory of one would be easily transmuted into a theory of the other.</p>
<p>My own prejudice would be to think about the historical novel (or costume drama) as a non-realist mode.  King Richard I plays the same sort of role as the Angel Gabriel.</p>
<p>But your committee was right:  If Rob Roy be not an historical novel where is historical novelicity to be found?</p>

						<p><i>Is the future really fictional?</i></p>
<p>Well, <i>yes</i>.  </p>
<p>More seriously, I take it that the distinction here isn&#8217;t between &#8216;historical&#8217; and &#8216;fictional&#8217;, but between &#8216;historical fiction&#8217; and other kinds of fiction.  Of course there could be well-researched, responsibly speculative fiction about what life might be like years after the colonization of Mars, but that doesn&#8217;t it make it historical any more than Lord of the Rings is historical, because one of the characteristics of something being historical is, I take it, that it takes as its focus actual past events.  No past event = no history, whatever the other merits of the work.</p>
<p>I certainly can believe that someone could write a speculative work about the future or an imagined past that adopted the tone and conventions of historical fiction, but that&#8217;s not sufficient, or so it seems to me, to make the work historical.</p>

						<p>Andrew said it well and I probably should stop. But, I won’t. I realize I’m being redundant and simplistic but for clarity sake I feel the need to add some more examples.<br />
Shaara&#8217;s Killer Angels is historical fiction. The historical moment is everything. The author is bound, in part, by fact, detail, evidence, etc. In order for it to work (and here I&#8217;m speaking as the proverbial everyman just like a two mouthed politician and media talking shi…er, head) the reader must believe that the thoughts, words, and actions of, say, Joshua Chamberlain are &#8220;real.&#8221; Which I realize is problematic but so was the Maginot line.<br />
Jeffrey Lent&#8217;s In The Fall is fiction set in history. The period provides canvas for the artist’s imaginings. We may hope for an accurate impression of the times but, it is an impression. If Lent had chosen to add some of SEK&#8217;s Martians it would be his prerogative. At this point, Lent would lose the average Shaara reader in a heartbeat. However, he may gain sci fi readers, friends of the Martians, literary fiction devotees and, he, may even achieve the goal of the greats by revealing some deeper “truth” (another loaded word) about our lives and our world.</p>

The problem with that definition is that it would define history rather narrowly (political history and biography count, but social and cultural milieus don&#8217;t).  It would also reduce the ability of fiction to engage with history to the domain of &#8220;based on a true story.&#8221;</p>

						<p>As Gary quite correctly states above, no genre definition will ever be a 100 percent correct, but I think arguing that a historical novel is one that &#8220;address historical material in a realist mode&#8221; is more incorrect than most. It includes too much, to my feeling. </p>
<p>The historical novel as a genre can be defined much more simple. Historical novels are those novels whose appeal lies in the historical sweep of events they describe, set in a clearly defined time period. <i>The Ice Storm</i> therefore doesn&#8217;t qualify even if it&#8217;s set earlier than the year it was written in, because it&#8217;s too small scale, not outwardly focused enough. Books that are written in periods now past on the other hand miss the self-consciousness appeal of being set in Another Period.</p>

						<p><em>I think you’re muddling, or responding to the muddled nature of a few things.</em></p>
<p>When you encounter a muddle, the best you can do is muddle through it.  That&#8217;s the problem with muddles.  To update a classic:</p>
<blockquote><p>When tweeting bloggers fight,<br />

noodle battle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, where was I?  Right, I remember:</p>
<p><em>That is, it’s work by an author writing in one time and place, self-consciously trying to set a story within another time and possibly place.</em></p>
<p>If I were to write a novel set in modern day Japan, about which I know very little, what sort of work would be required of me?  I would have to learn the language; the customs; the history that shaped contemporary social and cultural and political discussions&#8212;in essence, I would have to research the very same things required to write an historical novel.  The fact that it would be about contemporary Japanese society would prevent the work itself as being characterized as such, but categorically, the labor would be the same.  The content of the labor would be superficially different&#8212;contermporary Japan not quite belonging to history yet&#8212;but the product, it could be argued, would not be.</p>
<p>This is why defining the historical novel on the basis of content alone is problematic: the historical novel is a mode whose formal properties can be duplicated in works that lack historical content.  Moreover, the majority of people who read &#8220;proper&#8221; historical novels are drawn to works that resemble them formally: <em>Dune</em>, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, etc.  I&#8217;m not denying that Civil War enthusiasts read Civil War novels for their manifest content&#8212;I&#8217;m simply pointing out that the other novels they read share a formal repertoire that these readers have come to associate with a pleasurable reading experience.</p>
<p><em>Morrison sets her works in a historical setting and is concerned with the opportunities and constraints that operated in that setting. Wilson’s plays are fundamentally about history.</em></p>
<p>When you look at the list of historical novels generated in the other thread, though, you don&#8217;t see much in the way of Morrison, and the reason for that is formal.  Morrison&#8217;s novels are set in history, but they&#8217;re not historical novels in any sense other than the mundane.</p>
<p><em>I would argue that Ben Okri’s <b>The Famished Road</b> is one of the best historical fictions at capturing the late-colonial/early nationalist period in West Africa, despite a story-telling mode that Latin Americanists tend to call magical realism and the Harry Garuba has argued should be called animist materialism[.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m asking this honestly: do you think that works outside the Anglo-American and Continental traditions could be categorized as &#8220;historical novels&#8221; as defined in the other thread?  I don&#8217;t think they can, if only because magic realism and animist materialism violate the formal plausibility standard operative in the historical novel.  Historical novels about Africa and South America of the sort being discussed in the other thread are almost exclusively written by the colonizer, not the colonized.  Although I didn&#8217;t come out and say it, all the novels discussed belonged to the Anglo-American and Continental tradition, and as such, I was limiting my definition to novels within that tradition written in that particular mode.</p>
<p><em>The third category is not necessarily historical fiction in either of these senses, but is historical work that we (you and I, but mostly you) do with fiction.</em></p>
<p>This overlaps your second category, I think, inasmuch as I would use a novel like <em>Bright Lights, Big City</em> if I were writing about America in the 1980s much as I used <em>Pudd&#8217;nhead Wilson</em> when I wrote about America in the 1890s.</p>
<p><em>They’re all engagements with the idea or formal qualities of historical narrative. </em></p>
<p>They&#8217;re more than &#8220;engagements with&#8230;the formal qualities of historical narrative&#8221; because they actually <em>possess</em> the formal qualities of historical narrative.  Put differently, if I presented you with two novels concerning culturals about which you knew nothing and they both possessed the formal qualities of historical narrative, would you be able to divine, from the novels alone, if one of them were invented?  I don&#8217;t think you would.  </p>
<p>One problem, then, with calling them historical novels is that the adjective overwhelms the noun, leaving people unable to recognize the formal qualities for the historical content.  I&#8217;m not saying that the content and form are unrelated&#8212;obviously, I don&#8217;t buy that for a minute&#8212;but there are modal and generic qualities that this subset of novels commonly designated as &#8220;historical&#8221; share, and their presence in all novels designated thus <em>irrespective of content</em> means that they better capture the relationship between these novels than the fact that they are set in history.  Being &#8220;set in history&#8221; is, after all, about as nondescript and unhelpful as distinctive characteristics get.</p>
<p><em>I can’t define historical fiction, but I know it when I see it?</em></p>
<p>Gary&#8217;s point in his discussion of Knight is a nice corrective to my shorthand: I wish Potter had said &#8220;we know it when we see it,&#8221; because that&#8217;s the sort of uncritical consensus I refer back to in the post.</p>
<p><em>“Historical” meaning something close to your definition&#8212;realist(ic), real historical figures, about real historical events (though fictionalized)&#8212;and “period” meaning also set in the past, but with no or only incidental mention of real historical figures, centered around fictional characters involved in wholly fictional plots.</em></p>
<p>Distinguishing between historical and period novels works, but it complicates my theory a damn load, because many novels that I would identify as period or historical would be identified differently by others.  (Also, because period allows for the inclusion of works like <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</em> or <em>The Quincunx</em>, neither of which I would consider historical because they contain, in the first case, implausible events, and in both cases, they formally resemble Dickensian novels, and are therefore inadequately realist in the strict formal sense.</p>
<p><em>If <b>Rob Roy</b> be not an historical novel where is historical novelicity to be found?</em></p>
<p>Formally, its narrative structure and stable of characters share more with romances than novels, and romances are, by definition, not realistic.  Some strive for what would later be called realism, but their conventions are precisely those that novelists would mock and reject in &#8220;<em>The Manner of Cervantes, Author of <b>Don Quixote</b></em>,&#8221; to quote from the title of Henry Fielding&#8217;s <em>Joseph Andrews</em>.  It is, of course, more complicated than that, as the full title of Fielding&#8217;s novel is <em>The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, And of his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams, Written in Imitation of The Manner of Cervantes, Author of <b>Don Quixote</b></em>.  These writers crafted the novelistic form from the flayed carcas of the romance and dressed it in the desultory garb of romanticized history, and in so doing called attention to the limitations of and differentiating themselves from the romantic form.</p>

						<p>Jpool,</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that the distinction narrows what fits into the category of historical. Where we disagree is that this doesn&#8217;t seem like a big problem &#8211; or at least a bigger problem than other ways of drawing boundaries between categories &#8211; to me. I don&#8217;t see why &#8220;historical&#8221; and &#8220;period&#8221; can&#8217;t both be under a larger category of &#8220;having to do with the past.&#8221; To be honest, I don&#8217;t see very many works of fiction as &#8220;historical&#8221; in the sense of disciplinary history &#8211; basically, just fictionalized narratives of historical events, particularly those presented in some way as &#8220;the story of [some historical event, including biography].&#8221; So that&#8217;s pretty narrow as it is, and it falls apart with things that are a mixture, like <em>War and Peace</em>. But it&#8217;s all a muddle anyway.</p>

						<p>&#8220;Moreover, the majority of people who read &#8216;proper&#8217; historical novels are drawn to works that resemble them formally: Dune, Lord of the Rings, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter are both cases of works in the mode of what sf/fantasy writers call &#8220;world-building&#8221;: writers of historical fiction do the same thing, save they&#8217;re attempting to <i>reconstruct</i> a world according to the best available information, rather than deliberately invent aspects of a world that they nonetheless try to make as consisten as possible (whether more or less within the world of the possible, in a science fiction mode, or within the world of the impossible, in a fantasy mode).</p>
<p>Thus, while I didn&#8217;t bother to comment previously on how relevant questions such as &#8220;is the future really fictional,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a particularly interesting approach to the similarities and dissimilarities between historical fiction and less constrained forms of fictional world-building.  Others, to be sure, might find it fruitful, YMMV, etc.  </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;or at least a bigger problem than other ways of drawing boundaries between categories&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within and beyond any genre one can almost endlessly redraw and create new ways to categorize, and drop  &#8212; or fit by Procrustean effort, depending on how attached one is to their preferred set of categories &#8212; works into their newly alloted slots as one desires, but in the end either we&#8217;re making a useful and interesting point with our favored categorizations, or we&#8217;re doing the equivalent of rearranging our coin collections, or any other physical or metaphorical set of categories, which is to say, either in essentially in arbitrary fashion, or to make a specific point, or highlight a particular facet of what one is considering.</p>
<p>To switch metaphors, sometimes recasting one&#8217;s set of categories into a new alignment can give a new and previously unseen view or insight, but it&#8217;s all still a matter of making a choice as to how to arrange one&#8217;s mental preferences of choices.  There remains no One Objectively Best, or Most Correct, Way. </p>
<p>Categorize as one finds most useful to make a specific point: let a hundred flowers bloom.  Just don&#8217;t mistake your favorite flower for a Platonic one. </p>
<p>To go back to Scott&#8217;s original post, though, I find the whole idea of a &#8220;a self-evident genre&#8221; to be deeply problematic.  I don&#8217;t believe there is any such thing.  </p>
<p>Genres are historical accidents and publishing conveniences; there&#8217;s nothing particularly self-evident about them; they don&#8217;t generalize very well across divergent cultures, so far as I&#8217;m aware, and they historically evolve according to the dicates of the market, and literary fashions.</p>
<p>A persuasive manifesto, a small cluster of writers who identify with it, and some market response, are all that are necessary to create a working publishing subgenre that can be mined for at least a time, before it, too, evolves, and cross-breeds, and evolves and produces new subgenre heirs.</p>
<p>The manifesto isn&#8217;t a necessity at all, either, though it helps to give a form and a sense of identity to a sense of subgenre; but sometimes all it takes is a wave of success with publishing a particular kind of commercial fiction, or critically successful fiction, and, publishers being weathervanes out to chase the perceived signs of What&#8217;s Working Elsewhere In The Market, will do their best to produce imitations and new versions of what someone else, or given small set of writers, has/have been doing.</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked in a particular genre of popular fiction, or followed one closely, over a long enough period of time, will discern these ebbs and flows of subgenre creation and evolution, without much difficulty.  </p>
<p>Mystery fiction fashion evolves, say &#8212; I&#8217;m not in any way trying to follow an actual historical line of evolution in any of the following &#8212; subcategories of cozies, police procedurals, hardboiled private eyes, humorous criminals, locked-box puzzles, and so on.  </p>
<p>Science fiction goes from morality plays to teaching science to focusing on character, to world-building, to style, to space opera, to revolt of the New Wave, to New Hard Science, to social sf, to cyberpunk, to slipstream, to Mundane SF, to New Weird, to alternative presents, and so on.</p>
<p>Fantasy goes from sword and sorcery and adventure, to Tolkienesque world-building, to D&amp;D derivatives, to magical realism, to urban fantasy, to magical animals, to history-with-a-twist, to paranormal romances, and so on.</p>
<p>Romances go from Heyeresque to erotic romance, to historicals, to paranormal, back to contemporary, to beyond heterosexual, to vampire romances, and so on.</p>
<p>And over a longer period of time, that which we regard as whole &#8220;genres,&#8221; rather than &#8220;subgenres&#8221; evolve the same way.  </p>
<p>(Again, I wasn&#8217;t <i>in any way</i> attempting to draw any kind of actual accurate line of evolution from one of the above subgenres to another; doing that would be a PIA I don&#8217;t care to bother with at the moment.)</p>
<p>What we do is construct narratives of what is and isn&#8217;t a genre, and then consider their existence as somehow more natural than the purely artificial constructs anything that is purely an invented category is.</p>
<p>Publishing categories are invented, or at least, attempts to throw labels onto clusters of what&#8217;s popular for a given time, and then, for convenience, we send out sheep dogs to try to keep the herds marked, but genre rustlers come along and create new herds, and the herd animals often form new herds of their own.</p>
<p>Editors/publishers are just attempted buffalo shepherds, and critics stand back and contemplate and tell us what they think the current herds teach us.</p>
<p>People who like categorizing tend to wind up being either lumpers or splitters.  And so the play begins.  </p>
<p>(There are, of course, two kinds of people: those who like to divide people into two kinds of people, and those who do not.)</p>

						<p>I should probably wait politely for SEK to finish grading, but work is slow, so &#8230;</p>
<p><i>And when tweeting bloggers<br />
battle over augurs in a muddle,<br />
they call it<br />
a muddled tweeting<br />
blogger augur battle.</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not reading your tweets.  I&#8217;m just not. I already read you two and a half places, and I hate the format and illegibility of twitter.  I&#8217;m also not walking your poodle, so stop asking.</p>
<p><i>If I were to write a novel set in modern day Japan &#8230;  I would have to research the very same things required to write an historical novel.</i></p>
<p>I would quibble with your focus on work that the writer has to do (because, who cares?), but your point functions the same if we shift it (as you do later for imagniary histories) to work that the reader has to do.  So we&#8217;ll let that slide.  The bigger problem is the Johannes Fabian, <i>Time and the Other</i> one: the past may be <i>like</i> another country, and another country may <i>seem</i> like the past, but another country is not the past.  This is so because, as Fabian argues, the flatly evolotionary view of human societies in which they all occupy point on some pre-given line is, um, wrong.  It&#8217;s also so because the thing that makes contemporary societies different form one another are the product of those different and unevenly shared pasts. In a novel, time and place are both part of setting, but history is, or should be, more than this.  It&#8217;s an informing past.</p>
<p><i>Morrison’s novels are set in history, but they’re not historical novels in any sense other than the mundane.</i></p>
<p>I would argue with this more than a little.  On the one hand, Morrison often gets elements of history wrong, because over all her concerns are more mythic than historical.  But she is concerned with historical setting in a sepcific rather than a generic way.  She doesn&#8217;t want to recreate the history of a specific Ohio town (anymore than Achebe wanted to recreate the history of a particular Ibo village in <i>Things Fall Apart</i>), but she is, in most of her work, concerned with the specific conditions of African-American lives in particular historical times and places.  This is why I think it has to be a matter of degree rather than kind.  Some novels are more <i>about</i> history than others, just as some are more zeitgeist-y than others.</p>
<p><i>[D]o you think that works outside the Anglo-American and Continental traditions could be categorized as “historical novels” as defined in the other thread?</i></p>
<p>Well, I suppose it depends on what you mean by &#8220;outside&#8221; (Achebe has been criticized as Anthropological and therefor &#8220;outside&#8221; oriented) and how we understand the working definition in that other thread.  I understood the definition in that other thread to be some version of my second definition: works whose imaginitive representation of historical persons, settings and dynamics we find compelling.  So whether the inclusion of elements that some would deem fanatastic derails the whole enterprize depends on who we are and how wedded we are to a particular version of secular rationalism for our engagements with history.  For me it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><i>Historical novels about Africa and South America of the sort being discussed in the other thread are almost exclusively written by the colonizer, not the colonized.</i></p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know what you mean here or on what basis you&#8217;re asserting it.  How about Ousman Sembene&#8217;s <i>God&#8217;s Bits of Wood</i>, just to pick one?  Would that not be squarely within any understanding of historical fiction?</p>
<p><i>This overlaps your second category</i></p>
<p>It certainly can, but the overlap is only meaningful in the zeitgeist case.  Pace Jonathan Dressner at your place, you can both present <i>Pudd’nhead Wilson</i> as an imaginative  recreation of the early nineteenth century or as a cultural product of the late nineteenth century, and it&#8217;s both.</p>
<p>More later.</p>

						<p>SF editor Patrick Neilsen Hayden once said something along the lines of, &#8220;History is science fiction&#8217;s secret weapon.&#8221;  I take that as not only does SF mine history as a source (Mike Resnick&#8217;s <i>Paradise</i>, for example, is an extremely thinly-veiled history of Kenya, gussied up as SF), but people who enjoy SF and history are in the intersection of a Venn diagram.</p>
<p>As may be.  I suggest the question can not only be framed as:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Is the future really fictional?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>But also:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Is the past knowable enough to be <b>non</b>-fictional?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s been through the thickets of historiography knows that Heisenberg and Schrödinger might apply at least as much to history as to particles.  Anyone who&#8217;s been on a jury for a US criminal trial knows the similar problems.</p>
<p>Taking the position, then, that the difference between writing about the past and writing about the future is that the past is knowable, non-fictional, and can be pinned down&#8230; Well, to re-phrase a line from <i>The Princess Bride</i>, &#8220;Your past here is only <i>mostly</i> knowable.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with the original premise: The work a writer does is very similar regardless of whether the period is in the past or the future.  I&#8217;d go further: The work a <i>reader</i> does in constructing a scene from the narrative is very similar regardless of whether the period is in the past or the future.</p>

						<p><i>The work a writer does is very similar regardless of whether the period is in the past or the future. I’d go further: The work a reader does in constructing a scene from the narrative is very similar regardless of whether the period is in the past or the future.</i></p>
<p>Right, which is why work-doing is not a very useful way to make sense of an artistic product, no matter how fascinating it might be in interviews.  Also while it might be very similar, the work of making sense of a wholly invented world is still somehow different from the work we do understanding work that is trying to place itself within the world as it actually existed.  It just <i>feels</i> different.  Which brings us to&#8230;</p>
<p><i>They’re more than “engagements with…the formal qualities of historical narrative” because they actually </i>possess<i> the formal qualities of historical narrative.</i></p>
<p>Ah, see, here you and I mean different things by historical narrative (I suspect also &#8220;formal qualities&#8221;).  I meant the specific narrative form that disciplinary history has come to take, and as Andrew noted, only self-indulgent obsessives &#8212; and I don&#8217;t mean that in a bad way &#8212; like Tolkien actually do this.  Most fiction takes elements of that sort of macro-narrative and drop it into the smaller narrative (imagined micro-history? no not really) that forms the basis of their work.  As Gary Farber notes, whether the author does so with an eye towards historical fidelity and verisimilitude or simply towards internal coherence and plausibility certainly matters to them, but it also matters to most readers.  The fact that, if you know nothing from nothing, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference is unimportant.  The pleasures and indeed the point of reading historical fiction, as such, comes from knowing something about something, specifically the historical something that the particular fiction is about.</p>

						<p>dana:</p>
<p><em>I certainly can believe that someone could write a speculative work about the future or an imagined past that adopted the tone and conventions of historical fiction, but that’s not sufficient, or so it seems to me, to make the work historical.</em></p>
<p>Genres and modes are defined by their tone and conventions &#8212; that&#8217;s all there really is to them.  A Shakespeare play is a drama (genre) in a particular mode (tragic, comic, tragi-comic) irrespective of its content.  As I said before, I think the word &#8220;historical&#8221; is mucking up the works.  Put differently:</p>
<p><em>because one of the characteristics of something being historical is, I take it, that it takes as its focus actual past events</em></p>
<p>The characteristics of something being historical and those of the historical novel are not, nor should they be, the same.  </p>
<p>Martin:</p>
<p><em>The historical novel as a genre can be defined much more simple.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the historical novel deserves elevation to the status of a genre; or, at the very least, I would need to be convinced that its features are particular and peculiar enough to differentiate it from realist novels.  When you think about it, this makes sense given their shared concern for the authenticity of detail and eschewal of literary experimentation in order to focus the attention of their readers on the content  of their narrative.</p>
<p><em><b>The Ice Storm</b> therefore doesn’t qualify even if it’s set earlier than the year it was written in, because it’s too small scale, not outwardly focused enough.</em></p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s book, then, is a literary novel overstuffed with period detail that fails to rise to the level of an historical novel because its narrative is inadequately attentive to the sort of large-scale events commonly associated with historical writing.  I can see that, but then you&#8217;re making my case for me: historical novels are obsessed not with the issues addressed by contemporary historians&#8212;outside of Stephenson, there&#8217;s not much comparable to the works of historians of ideas or science, and <em>The Ice Storm</em> addresses concerns best associated with social historians&#8212;such novels are obsessed with the sort of sweeping narratives associated with earlier generations of historians, <em>e.g.</em> the Great Man theory of history, military history, etc.</p>
<p>Gary:</p>
<p><em>The latter are both cases of works in the mode of what sf/fantasy writers call “world-building”: writers of historical fiction do the same thing, save they’re attempting to reconstruct a world according to the best available information, rather than deliberately invent aspects of a world that they nonetheless try to make as consistent as possible (whether more or less within the world of the possible, in a science fiction mode, or within the world of the impossible, in a fantasy mode).</em></p>
<p>That was more or less my point: world-building novels only work when the word they build make sense as worlds.  Clute&#8217;s <em>Appleseed</em> is a realist novel set in a world whose rules the readers are supposed to, but don&#8217;t, understand intuitively&#8212;there are no <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/not-infodumps-constellations.html" rel="nofollow">infodumps</a> to help the reader understand what this button does or why that person has eleven senses&#8212;and the result is a profound inability to understand what is happening in basic narrative terms.  It&#8217;s a fully-realized, realist vision of a world whose treatment of the social norms and relevant technologies is akin to Moody&#8217;s in <em>The Ice Storm</em>, but it is not an historical novel.  <em>Dune</em>, on the other hand, shares with its readers countless detailed passages that situate even the most arcane rituals in a manner that makes their meaning and import abundantly clear . . . which is akin to the description of the niceties in a royal court in an historical novel set in medieval France.</p>
<p>In short, world-building is a fundamental feature that science fiction novels liked by people who read historical fiction regularly but science fiction only occasionally share . . . and that correspondence tells us something important about what it means to be a proper historical novel.</p>
<p><em>I find the whole idea of a “a self-evident genre” to be deeply problematic. I don’t believe there is any such thing. </em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I said: &#8220;there is a problem with talking about the &#8216;historical novel&#8217; as a self-evident genre.&#8221;</p>
<p>JPool:</p>
<p><em>I’m not reading your tweets. I’m just not. </em></p>
<p>What, you don&#8217;t like to read announcements of posts you read in two-and-a-half other places? </p>
<p><em>the past may be like another country, and another country may seem like the past, but another country is not the past. </em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re privileging the historicity of the historical content here, which is fine, but granting it a special status doesn&#8217;t mean that the genre and mode through which that special content is unique.  To put this in terms of a less complex genre: if we were talking about what is and is not a timeline, would it be correct to say that <a href="http://americanhistory.about.com/library/timelines/bltimelinesindex.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-a-historical-timeline-of-events-leading-up-to-the-miniseries.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> are both timelines?  </p>
<p>My entire argument here boils down to me saying, &#8220;Yes, those are both timelines.&#8221;  </p>
<p><em>I would argue with this [statement about Morrison not being an historical novelist] more than a little. </em></p>
<p>I would no more say that Faulkner is an ahistorical novelist than I would Morrison, but I also wouldn&#8217;t say that either of them wrote historical novels. </p>
<p><em>works whose imaginitive representation of historical persons, settings and dynamics we find compelling. </em></p>
<p>Except, beginning with <em>Gain</em> and with a few exceptions&#8212;Pynchon and Vonnegut&#8212;most of the works discussed there were not simply compelling, but compellingly similar in their generic features, which is why I was reminded so strongly of my qualifying exams.  </p>
<p>Hal:</p>
<p><em>“Is the past knowable enough to be non-fictional?”</em></p>
<p>This is the perfect complement to my question, because it concretizes what I only hint at above: namely, that the privileging of history as something tangible enough to warrant special status, genre be damned, belongs to the earlier historigraphical conceit that historians have access to solid historical truths.  Without mentioning names that&#8217;ll drive my co-bloggers batty, I think we can leave it by saying that fictional imaginings of complex social relations share quite a bit with non-fictional accounts of complex social relations.  This isn&#8217;t to say that social historians consciously recreate other societies on the basis of their intuitive understanding of their own&#8212;I don&#8217;t think they do&#8212;but only to note that the present weighs on the past as much as the past does on the present.</p>

						<p>From your infodump post: &#8220;The infodump, as Todd VanDerWerff points out, may well be the single generic feature shared by all flavors of science fiction&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s wrong.  Info-dumping is often more a sign of bad science fiction writing than anything else, though it&#8217;s by no means <i>necessarily</i> a sign of bad science fiction writing at all.  (Cue up some debate on <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/" rel="nofollow">Neal Stephenson</a>.)</p>
<p>But lots of good science fiction writing of a variety of types does without infodumping, and that&#8217;s part of what makes it good sf.  Examples of this are as legion as infodumping sf that&#8217;s good sf.  </p>
<p>Not all bad sf has infodumping &#8212; there are plenty of ways to be bad without it &#8212; but noticeable infodumping is (tautologically) noticeably lumpy and anything lumpy is often a distraction from what the writer would prefer you to notice.  Many writers who don&#8217;t fall into the pre-J. W. Campbellian era, at least. </p>
<p>I carefully hedge, because often infodumping <i>is</i> crucial to authorial intent, whether in sf, fantasy, or in fact in many types of mystery fiction, where a primary thread of interest dangled before the reader is to attract the reader to learn a lot about a subject they know little about and find interesting to learn about in the course of the story.  Which thread is sweetener and which is medicine is subjectively judged.  </p>
<p>See also Jo Walton&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_%28literary_technique%29#Incluing" rel="nofollow">coinage of <i>incluing</i></a>.  See also Heinlein and Delany and a lot of other good sf writers on how to write good sf.  </p>
<p>See also <a href="http://www.sff.net/People/Vonda/Pitfalls.htp#Pf01" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="http://www.kith.org/journals/jed/2006/04/29/3504.html" rel="nofollow">expository</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ANfI-0uMyXwC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%22expository+lump%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iL9RRj3LkU&amp;sig=ThfgG4cKOhAvq07mJwTrN-4UgRI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KoqlSpmvDpqQtgevxNHPDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22expository%20lump%22&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">lump</a>.</p>
<p>I might be better off, rather than trying to imply any correlation at all between &#8220;bad sf and &#8220;good sf&#8221; with noticeable info-dumping versus incluing, simply restraining myself to observing that noticeable info-dumping/expository lumping is famously often badly done.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is a digression, but I had to hack and cough there.  Expository lump of my own to expel.</p>
<p>I really must read <i>Appleseed</i> eventually; I have tremendous respect for John Clute as a critic.  </p>
<p>&#8220;This is the perfect complement to my question, because it concretizes what I only hint at above: namely, that the privileging of history as something tangible enough to warrant special status, genre be damned, belongs to the earlier historigraphical conceit that historians have access to solid historical truths.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you said this, because it was a point I wanted to address, but didn&#8217;t feel adept enough to, as yet, in front of professional historians.  I&#8217;ll leave discussion of it here in far more capable hands than mine.</p>

						<p>Actually, I think the infodump may well be a hallmark of historical fiction as well, at least historical fiction which adopts relatively unfamiliar milieux. Often the authors disguise it by having a &#8220;fish out of water&#8221; character to whom everything needs to be explained.

						<p><i>My entire argument here boils down to me saying, “Yes, those are both timelines.”</i></p>
<p>Right, but &#8220;timeline&#8221; is a neutral noun while &#8220;historical&#8221; is not.  I can get down with the post-structuralism and say that there many kinds of history and many true narratives, all equally valid if some more relevant to any given question than others.  But if &#8220;historical&#8221; means anything it has to include the effort to get it right.  If it doesn&#8217;t then we&#8217;ll need another term that does.  The first of those examples is a historical timeline.  The second one is a fictional historical timeline, or, more properly, a timeline of a fictional history.</p>
<p><i>Which is why we’re in the respective departments we’re in.</i></p>
<p>This is true.  <b>This</b>, however,</p>
<p><i>[It feels different] despite the possibility of it being formally identical to this other novel means that you’re privileging the presumed, and quite possibly suspect, historicity of the historical material upon which it’s based over those formal qualities that make it what it is.</i></p>
<p>is right about the &#8220;despite&#8221; bit, but wrong about everything else.  I&#8217;m not privileging historicity.  Note the last part of this sentence o&#8217; mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, I could see good literary reasons to make a distinction between this abstract sense of history and with fiction that wants to engage with history <i>wie es eigentlich gewesen ist</i>, whatever level of fidelity or consistency it actually achieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, that was obnoxious, but I don&#8217;t think the historicity of historical fiction is nearly as important as it&#8217;s attempt to reflect or represent history.  It&#8217;s not even necessarily an engagement with academic histories, but with the idea of history as an accurate representation of the past, rather than myth or gauzy place-setting, however accurate the results end up being.  Historians are always going to kvetch about the accuracy of historical fiction, it&#8217;s like a law or something, but historians are a fairly small segment of the reading public.  Knowing that an author has made this or that historical error only matters to the wider reading public when they are reading the sort of book that shows that an author was intended to get things right.  Which is why, whatever sort of formal similarities speculative fictions might have to historical fictions, they remain different things.  To suggest otherwise ignores widely established vernacular and intellectual understandings of both &#8220;historical fiction&#8221; and &#8220;history&#8221;.</p>

						<p>It took me several reads to grasp that by &#8220;incidentally historical&#8221; Scott meant &#8220;about the past&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think I can summarize the five paragraphs of the long pedantic version thus:</p>
<p>1: defining &#8220;historical novel&#8221; as &#8220;realist novel with a setting prior to the time of its writing&#8221; admits too much [we will have to wait for this to be substantiated]. Also, &#8220;historical novels&#8221; does not mean &#8220;novels from history&#8221;, <em>even though</em> novels from history not about the then-future are about the present past!</p>
<p>2: Only realist novels can be historical novels, except when novels that aren&#8217;t realist novels can be historical novels. For instance, a modernist novel might be historical, if it possesses &#8220;a particular distance from and attitude towards historical events&#8221;. <em>Rob Roy</em> doesn&#8217;t, but <em>Huck Finn</em> does.</p>
<p>3. However, most people don&#8217;t want to call <em>Huck Finn</em> a historical novel, because they think it doesn&#8217;t possess the right attitude to historical events. They do, moreover, want to call <em>Rob Roy</em> a historical novel, because they think it does. For instance, <em>RR</em> realistically treats of the major historical figures that appear within it [1].</p>
<p>4. We put such stress on this attitude to the past, especially the component of historical plausibility, that novels set in the future or the present qualify as historical, on the basis of having this attitude. By the way, <em>Rob Roy</em> is out again.</p>
<p>5. In sum, using ill-defined criteria it is possible to gather together an arbitrary group of novels; this being done one can call them &#8220;historical&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is that fair?</p>
<p>Anyway, the proposed criterion, whatever it is (I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;historically plausible&#8221;, as opposed to &#8220;plausible given the genre&#8221;, means if science-fictional accounts of the future get to be historically plausible) strikes me as daft. As I would be tempted to use the phrase, <em>Christ Recrucified</em> would count as <em>historically</em> plausible, but I&#8217;d hardly hold it up as a central case of the historical novel and am not even sure I&#8217;d count it as one at all, despite its being set in historical Crete; it doesn&#8217;t seem very concerned <em>with history</em>. (Whereas <em>Rob Roy</em> actually <em>is</em> concerned with history.) On the other hand, maybe all that&#8217;s really wanted is somewhat scrupulous attention to the historical setting, along with the requirement that the setting be &#8220;in history&#8221; and not just the past (a novel that was written in 2008 and set in 2006: not historical). (The vagueness of when &#8220;history&#8221; begins is a nonissue.) </p>
<p>It would be interesting to read a post about the historical novel that wasn&#8217;t written by Humpty Dumpty.</p>
<p>[1] It is simply false that a historical novel <em>must</em> include great personages and deeds. I was going to adduce Sigrid Undset as proof of this, but it turns out that both <em>The Master of Hestviken</em> and <em>Kristin Lavransdottir</em> include cameos by real people. Nevertheless, it would be daft to think that it&#8217;s by <em>their</em> strength that the novels are counted historical; rather, <em>because</em> the novels are historical, and recount such and such (fictitious) goings-on, real persons can be included, for the same reason that real customs are. If <em>Morality Play</em> isn&#8217;t a historical novel, it&#8217;s not because the Pope isn&#8217;t in it.</p>

						<p>So: this is a bit of a bleg comment.  I&#8217;m working on popular music, not literature but I&#8217;m feeling like I don&#8217;t know enough about how literatists deal with the formation of genre.  It was Gary&#8217;s comments upstream that really made me want to wade in a little:</p>
<p>&#8220;Genres are historical accidents and publishing conveniences; there’s nothing particularly self-evident about them; they don’t generalize very well across divergent cultures, so far as I’m aware, and they historically evolve according to the dictates of the market, and literary fashions.&#8221;</p>
<p>this strikes me as pretty close to the way that I think about genre, which is highly influenced by a seminar I took with Rick Altman on film genre. His book on this is Film/Genre &amp; I&#8217;d link to Amazon but I&#8217;m html incompetent &amp; I recall this blog rejecting comments with pasted links.  anyway, my simple takeaway from Altman was that film genre (and not just film I think) is discursive, that it&#8217;s constructed the way that Gary argues above in a process between studios, critics and consumers, that genres are unstable over time, that genre hybridity is more the rule than genre heterogeneity, etc.  </p>
<p>All of this seems very applicable to my understanding of how musical genre works, although I think that musical genres are even less stable and more subject to vernacular trends and developments.  Music listeners also seem to more observably function in what Altman called &#8220;genre communities&#8221; &#8211;which, along with his communication models seemed to be the stuff that most of the film students in the seminar were dubious of. </p>
<p>so, I guess I&#8217;m wondering if there are a few dependable accounts of literary genre formation that are sympathetic to these conceptions that anyone here would recommend? there are places where music and writing share or at least analogize the kinds of characteristics that people use to place them in genres*, and I need to be able to address that as if I have some idea of what I&#8217;m talking about. Thanks very much to anyone who has time/interest in helping at their convenience.</p>

						<p>JPool:</p>
<p><em>Right, but “timeline” is a neutral noun while “historical” is not.</em></p>
<p>The analogue of &#8220;timeline&#8221; is &#8220;novel,&#8221; though, not &#8220;historical.&#8221;  My point was that it&#8217;s called a timeline even if the events are fictional, as you noted, because it shares identical generic features with its nonfictional counterpart.  </p>
<p><em>To suggest otherwise ignores widely established vernacular and intellectual understandings of both “historical fiction” and “history”.</em></p>
<p>Unless you claim that the act of seeking out historical accuracy results in formal differences&#8212;and there&#8217;s an argument to be made there&#8212;you&#8217;re claiming that two works can be formally identical but fundamentally different.  Whatever&#8217;s responsible for that difference must, by definition, be pretty special if it alone warrants creating a subset within formally identical category.  If Poem X is a sonnet and Poem Y is a sonnet, but Poem Y belongs to a different category on the basis of it being about Z, how do you justify distinguishing between them without privileging Z?  </p>
<p>Ari:</p>
<p><em>?</em></p>
<p>As I noted, there may be something to the argument that those novelists who seek to ground their work in a historical milieu end up writing something substantively different from those who invent it; however, there are so many examples to the contrary.  To quote from an unpublished dissertation:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Silas Weir] Mitchell himself had “spent seven years in the library of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania” learning “where the principal people lived, who were their children, what they ate and drank, what were their ways, their talk and their dress, and the political feelings of the great families” in order to “equip” himself to “begin to write the story of <em>Hugh Wynne</em>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The quotations are from Mitchell&#8217;s letters, and they indicate that he cared deeply about historical fidelity . . .  and yet the final product is an historical romance.  Such items were wildly popular.  To quote from that same source:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 1895 and 1908, at least 140 books detailing English Colonial or Revolutionary America were published.  Though they varied in quality, their success speaks to the demand for fictional accounts of American life before 1789.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the majority of them aren&#8217;t properly historical in any contemporary sense.  So despite his researches and commitment to historical fidelity, what historical romancers claimed, to quote Mitchell about his novel <em>Constance Trescott</em> (1905), is that their works were</p>
<blockquote><p>“absolutely true to life,” by which [Mitchell] meant that “it is not the kind of tragedy where an invisible outside fate pulls the strings of human puppets.” </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not what we mean when we say &#8220;absolutely true to life,&#8221; because he&#8217;s basically defining historical romance against the realist and, more pointedly here, naturalist novels of the time.  All of which is a bit of a detour back to my main point: the historical content didn&#8217;t alter the fact that these were, in generic and modal terms, romances, and even though we refer to them as historical romances, the word &#8220;historical&#8221; doesn&#8217;t convey any special status upon them.</p>
<p>The conversation here, though, is that word &#8220;historical&#8221; does convey a special status when it describes the word &#8220;novel,&#8221; and that I think this is, at the very least, an unproven assertion.  </p>
<p>ben:</p>
<p><em>Is that fair?</em></p>
<p>Except for the fact that you completely ignore the most important part of the argument&#8212;the formal qualities of the novels, which is the crux of the issue in your #4&#8212;absolutely.  By which I mean, of course, the opposite.  This, especially:</p>
<p><em>In sum, using ill-defined criteria it is possible to gather together an arbitrary group of novels; this being done one can call them “historical”.</em></p>
<p>You seem to have missed the fact that I was rehearsing, in my own chatty way, the disciplinary history of treatments of the historical novel.  </p>
<p>More shortly.</p>

						<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sKcAAAAAMAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Nield, 1904</a>:  </p>
<blockquote><p>As there has been some dispute on this question of the Historical Novel proper, I offer the following definition:—A Novel is rendered <em>Historical</em> by the introduction of dates, personages, or events, to which identification can readily be given.  I am quite aware that certain well-known novels which give the <em>general atmosphere of a period</em>—such, for example, as Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;Scarlet Letter&#8221; and Mr. Hewlett&#8217;s &#8220;Forest Lovers&#8221;—do not come within the scope of my definition, but this is just why I have added a &#8220;Supplementary List&#8221; of semi-historical tales.</p></blockquote>
<p>His list includes <em>Rob Roy</em>, and Twain&#8217;s <em>Joan of Arc</em> and <em>Prince and the Pauper</em>, though not <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.</p>
<p>I kind of like this definition, even though or perhaps especially because it privileges a presentist notion of history in that phrase &#8220;to which identification can readily be given&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Lukács of course not only includes Scott but <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nuGqXYzBj_wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">argues that with him, the historical novel truly begins</a>.  Before him,</p>
<blockquote><p>history is &#8230; treated as mere costumery:  it is only the curiosities and oddities of the <em>milieu</em> that matter, not an artistically faithful image of a concrete historical epoch.  What is lacking in the so-called historical novel before Sir Walter Scott is precisely the specifically historical, that is, derivation of the individuality of characters from the historical peculiarity of their age.</p></blockquote>
<p>This too seems like a useful way to begin thinking about the subject.  We have here the idea that historical novels should include recognizable persons, events, and dates, and that they should treat characters as derived from the historical peculiarity of their age.</p>
<p>Also of interest, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nuGqXYzBj_wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">Lukács on Scott&#8217;s method of characterization</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scott, by disclosing the actual conditions of life, the actual growing crisis in people&#8217;s lives, depicts all the problems of popular life which lead up to the historical crisis he has represented.  And when he has made us sympathizers and understanding participants of this crisis, when we understand exactly for what reasons the crisis has arisen, for what reasons the nation has split into two camps, and when we have seen the attitude of the various sections of the population towards this crisis, only then does the great historical hero enter upon the scene of the novel.  He may therefore, indeed he must, be complete in a psychological sense when he appears before us, for he appears in order to fulfil his historic mission in the crisis. The reader, however, never has the impression of anything rigidly complete, for the broadly drawn social struggles which precede the appearance of the hero show how at just such a time, just such a hero had to arise in order to solve just such problems.  Scott, of course, uses this portrayal not only for the historically authenticated and well-known representative figures.  On the contrary.  In Scott&#8217;s most important novels historically unknown, semi-historical or entirely non-historical persons play this leading role.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, I think these definitions would clash with SEK&#8217;s argument that historical novels are only ever incidentally historical.  Clearly these definitions, based on recognizability of subject matter as historically important and insistent that characters be derived from the actual historical conditions of an era, argue that historical novels are only ever essentially historical.</p>

						<p><em>I think these definitions would clash with SEK’s argument that historical novels are only ever incidentally historical</em></p>
<p>Absolutely.  My definition is a reaction to Lukács, who&#8212;as <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/enemies-made-or-enemies-born/" rel="nofollow">I noted here last April</a>&#8212;was less interested in describing the features of a text than he was in elevating the revolutionary credibility of person doing the describing.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about Nield to know where he&#8217;s coming from, but it&#8217;s odd that he includes <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> but not <em>Huck Finn</em>, even though the former is about as historically sophisticated as the Disney version and the latter actually does, as Lukács would have it, make &#8220;us sympathizers and understanding participants of this crisis, when we understand exactly for what reasons the crisis has arisen, for what reasons the nation has split into two camps, and when we have seen the attitude of the various sections of the population towards this crisis.&#8221;  (Except, of course, there&#8217;s no &#8220;great historical hero [to] enter upon the scene of the novel.&#8221;)  All of which is my way of saying, I&#8217;d distrust someone who included <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> just as much as I would someone whose definition of the historical must meet a vaguely Marxist yardstick.</p>
<p><em>SEK offered an argument to that effect?</em></p>
<p>The title, plus the bit about <em>Red Mars</em> being an historical novel, should&#8217;ve given that gave away.</p>

						<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any reason to fret that <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> doesn&#8217;t fit these definitions.  (1) there&#8217;s an argument, which you may consider spurious, that the reason canonical novels are canonical is that they captivate us in spite of their transcending genre expectations; (2) Twain famously didn&#8217;t know what the hell he was trying to achieve with <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>; see approximately everybody on the ending.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t fathom why you think <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em>, which is after all about Henry VIII and his heir, can&#8217;t count as a historical novel.  There are lots of unsophisticated historical novels.</p>

						<p><em>[T]here’s an argument, which you may consider spurious, that the reason canonical novels are canonical is that they captivate us in spite of their transcending genre expectations[.]</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t consider that argument spurious, but I do think that it&#8217;s odd to talk about generic expectations when, in fact, the features of that genre (or mode, as I would have it) are the issue here.  How to say this . . . before we can talk about generic expectations, we need to understand what they are.  If you think that <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> qualifies as an historical novel, what I would want to know is whether you think it&#8217;d right to include it in the same category as you would <em>Gain</em> or <em>The Killer Angels</em>.  To me, the differences between them are such that I&#8217;d have a difficult time justifying shuffling them into the same cubbyhole.</p>
<p><em>There are lots of unsophisticated historical novels.</em></p>
<p>It can, but it doesn&#8217;t meet the same factual standard that <em>Gain</em> did.  Like <em>Connecticut Yankee</em>, its historicity is a pretense that allowed him to comment on his present moment.  It was another of Twain&#8217;s thought experiments-played-out-in-narrative, and like the rest of them, involved twins or something very similar.  To quote again from that illustrious, yet somehow unpublished, dissertation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Such is the fate of the true Tom Driscoll in <em>Pudd’nhead Wilson</em> who, trained by a slave to be a slave, and having spent all his years treated as slaves are treated, cannot adapt to life as a white male anymore than Twain could “follow his curious fate further—that would be a long story” (224).  Length is not the motivating factor for Twain’s reluctance.  An infant could be swaddled in a slave’s linens and become a slave; but when an adult assumes a wardrobe proper to his station, it only calls attention to his defects of speech, attitude, gesture, bearing, and laugh.  “The poor fellow,” Twain writes, “could not endure the terrors of the white man’s parlor, and felt at home and at peace nowhere but the kitchen” (224).  According to the folk-genealogy of blood, Tom’s whiteness should be coursing through his veins, but Tom cannot experience the artificial morality of the freeborn and wealthy as natural.  He is the slave his false mother, Roxana, trained him to be.  Twain would rather not finish Tom’s story because a restored heir with a slave’s demeanor would only be sympathetic in the abstract.  Place him in the company of white women, for example, and his speech and mannerisms would remind readers of miscegenation.   The only path to improvement Twain leaves open to Tom is the one his usurper blazed: apply to Yale and, if it will accept an illiterate adult with the base manner of a slave, acquire “Eastern polish” (50).  Had he been younger and somewhat schooled, Twain suggests, Tom might have been able to outwit the slave nature experience imparted him.  In <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> (1882), being literate allows Tom Canty to acquire the affectations of the boy with whom he swap places, Prince Edward, for reading “about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to act the prince, unconsciously” (23).  Without having trained himself in princely manner and speech, Canty and Edward’s exchange would be even more implausible.  As with the animals in Twain’s experiment, Driscoll and Canty are products of an essentialism after the fact.  Had Canty continued impersonating Edward, his early training would have allowed him to walk in royal circles without suffering the social paralysis that bedeviled Driscoll, whose damnably sorry story Twain cannot even bring himself to tell.</p></blockquote>
<p>If historical novels aim, as JPool and others argue above, to elucidate something about a particular historical moment, then the only Twain novel that really qualifies is <em>Huck Finn</em>.  Otherwise, Twain used history to as a means of mocking tradition and the persistence of superstition in contemporary life, as with <em>The Diaries of Adam and Eve</em>.</p>

						<p>SEK,<br />
eric more eloquently presents what I was grasping towards.  Being a dilletant, I was unfamiliar with Lukacs on this point before seeing Luther Blisset and others refer to it at that other place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m vaguely Marxist, so perhaps you&#8217;ll find yourself suspicious of my argument, but in the passage that eric quoted and the bits around it that I read, the Marxist theory of history Lukacs is employing seems incidental to the theory of what constitutes a/the historical novel that he&#8217;s putting forth. That is, you could reject his understanding of a set of national crises or his argument about the role of those crises in the emergence of the historical novel and still have his definition of what constitutes or characterizes the historical novel intact.  So, unless you&#8217;re confessing to a knee-jerk Marxiphobia, I don&#8217;t see from whence your suspicions arise.</p>
<p>You seem to be chasing yourself in a circle with this formal qualities thing.  &#8220;It can&#8217;t be a genre, because genres aren&#8217;t about formal qualities, but many of the novels described as historical fiction don&#8217;t share formal qualities, so they can&#8217;t all be part of the same category.&#8221;  What if it was a kind of genre?  What if they didn&#8217;t necessarily share formal qualities?  Wouldn&#8217;t that allow us to get a lot closer to the way the term has traditionally been used and understood?  At the same time, maybe what you&#8217;ve actually been arguing for is a different category of fiction that deserves a different name than &#8220;historical novels&#8221; since it would exclude some historical novels and includes other novels that are not historical but contain speculative or imaginary histories.  Um, I don&#8217;t have a good name to suggest for you, mostly because of the linguistic problems already discussed.</p>
<p>andrew, FWIW I wouldn&#8217;t reject the historical/period distinction, I just wasn&#8217;t sure about the grounds that you were making it on (specific events or persons) and think it makes more sense to think of it in terms of a sliding scale rather than balls and strikes.</p>

<p>This, definitely. I wasn&#8217;t trying to be too precise about the boundaries, though it might have seemed that way. So though I see a larger space for period than for historical, there&#8217;s still a wide band for things between the two spaces on the scale.</p>
