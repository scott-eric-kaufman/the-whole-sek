		<p>(<em>Before I get started, I want to acknowledge that I know <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/">Ann Althouse</a> is an attention fiend, and as such revels in any that comes her way.  Furthermore, I know that giving her the attention she craves will only embolden her to spout even more outrageous nonsense in the future.  However, the white-hotness of her intellectual dishonesty here compels me to consider it a vacuity of historical import.  Future scholars will read this post and realize that <strong>this</strong> was the moment crypto-conservatives discovered the fact that no matter how shallow their waters were, Zeno and his paradox prevented them from ever being emptied altogether.</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It may not be breaking new that the President copped a glance at a young Mayara Rodrigues Tavare last week:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-10041 aligncenter" title="forced01" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/forced01.jpg?w=490" alt="forced01" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/forced01.jpg 399w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/forced01.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/forced01.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"   /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But I want to call your attention to Ann Althouse&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2009/07/2-world-leaders-demonstrate-2-ways-of.html">close-reading</a>&#8221; of the photograph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama&#8217;s arms hang free, emphasizing the tilt, and either gravity or will causes the left arm to hang inches away from the torso. See how much lower the right hand is than the left? His neck is craned out and around so that the line of sight is directly at the ass. His mouth is open as if to say: That&#8217;s what I want.</p></blockquote>
<p>When presented with <a href="http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/?id=2922741&amp;ref=fpblg">video evidence to the contrary</a>, she curtly replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have seen the video, and I stand by my analysis of the still photograph.</p></blockquote>
<p>She watched <em>video evidence</em> that refutes her analysis and stands by it anyway.  But I believe she can be forgiven for insisting, essentially, that photograph is what it is, because she knows nothing about photography.  A competent photographer would know, for example, what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective">forced perspective</a> is, and that the effect sometimes occurs accidentally, such that a child innocently swatting an insect might appear to be brutalizing a baby (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42873250@N00/3530558803/in/pool-forcedperspective">Exhibit 1</a>).  This occurs is because both subjects are within the depth of field:</p>
<p><span id="more-10045"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-10042 aligncenter" title="depthoffield01" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield01.jpg?w=490" alt="depthoffield01" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield01.jpg?w=490 490w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield01.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield01.jpg?w=300 300w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield01.jpg 518w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"   /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Batman who is too close the camera is as blurry as the one too far away.  Only the Batman within the depth of field is in focus.  Accidental forced perspective happens because auto-focusing cameras increase the depth of field and flatten the picture.  Objects both near <em>and</em> far remain in focus, such that when you innocently shoot this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-10043 aligncenter" title="depthoffield02" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield02.jpg?w=490" alt="depthoffield02" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield02.jpg?w=490 490w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield02.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield02.jpg?w=300 300w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/depthoffield02.jpg 518w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"   /></p>
<p>You <a href="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/batmanrobinkissing1.jpg">end up with this</a>. Modern cameras flatten images by making it appear as if everything within the depth of field is the same distance from the photographer.  The effect can be exaggerated by having one object both further away and occupying higher ground (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/damonabnormal/73629573/">Exhibit 2</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/inhisgrace/2185143149/">Exhibit 3</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wozzle/3203422524/">Exhibit 4</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trudym/3227255858/">Exhibit 5</a>), but the general principle remains: so long as both objects are in focus, they will appear to be the same distance from the photographer.</p>
<p>The video of Obama clearly shows that not only is he moving <em>toward</em> the camera as Ms. Tavare walks <em>away</em> from it, he is also moving from a higher position to a lower one relative to the photographer.  In short, anyone with any knowledge of photography would know that Obama looks to a right that is three feet in front of Ms. Tavare, but that because of a perfect storm of aperture and architecture, the flattened image gives the impression that he is scoping out the underage Brazilian.</p>
<p>Only it doesn&#8217;t even do that.</p>
<p>A competent judge of images would notice that Obama is not entirely in focus, meaning that he is only entering the depth of field; whereas Ms. Tavare is crisply focused, meaning that she is currently within the depth of field.  That bears repeating: she is within the depth of field that Obama is just entering, and must therefore be closer to the photographer than he is.</p>
<p>Given that Obama cannot be both closer to <em>and</em> further away from the photographer than Ms. Tavare, anyone with any photographic expertise would recognize that Obama can&#8217;t possibly be, as Althouse in her ignorance observes, &#8220;caught [in a] moment of as-yet-unconstrained pursuit,&#8221; because <em>he can&#8217;t see her behind when he&#8217;s in front of her</em>.</p>
<p>If Althouse knew anything about photography, she would know this.  But because she doesn&#8217;t, we can forgive her for&#8212;what&#8217;s that you say?  She considers herself something <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/search/label/photography">an expert on the subject</a>?  Quit pulling my leg.  No one who regularly shoots anything could not notice that Obama&#8217;s only just coming into focus&#8212;she posts photographs to her blog daily?  <em>Really</em>? You mean to tell me that someone who knows about photography <em>and</em> has seen the video insists that Obama shot Ms. Vasare a lascivious glance?</p>
<p>Maybe we ought to forgive her anyway, because it&#8217;s difficult to tell from low-resolution versions of that photograph <a href="http://d.yimg.com/a/p/rids/20090709/i/r3356552547.jpg?x=400&amp;y=340&amp;q=85&amp;sig=_dbUibuGcHSmlg8QoaQV7A--">like the one she posted</a> that <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlLA/poli_sci/just_looking_121246.asp?c=rss">the high-resolution version</a> on which it&#8217;s based has been digitally manipulated to make Obama look sharper.  What do I mean?  Sharpening tools increase the contrast between pixels.  Say I take a picture of a President with a blurry hand:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10047" title="bushhandblurry" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandblurry.png?w=490" alt="bushhandblurry" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandblurry.png 341w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandblurry.png?w=125 125w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandblurry.png?w=250 250w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px"   /></p>
<p>I can sharpen that hand so it looks less blurry:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10048" title="bushhandsharp" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandsharp.png?w=490" alt="bushhandsharp" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandsharp.png 341w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandsharp.png?w=125 125w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bushhandsharp.png?w=250 250w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px"   /></p>
<p>But because that hand was so blurry, I couldn&#8217;t sharpen it without creating digital artifacts.  The area I sharpened is a clearly-defined box in which the altered pixels are more distinct from their neighbors than those elsewhere in the picture are from theirs.  Even the seemingly uniform blue background bears evidence of my sharpening.</p>
<p>Increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels also makes it appear as if there are more pixels in one area of the photograph than another.  So when you encounter an image in which there appear to be more pixels in one clearly-demarcated area than another, you know that you are looking at an image that has been digitally sharpened.  For example, compare the black hem and pantyhose adjacent to the hand in this random photograph:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10049" title="hand03" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/hand03.jpg?w=490" alt="hand03" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/hand03.jpg?w=490 490w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/hand03.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/hand03.jpg?w=300 300w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/hand03.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"   /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">See the box?  Now compare the neckline of this black shirt to the shirt itself in the same photograph:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10050" title="headandneckline" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/headandneckline.jpg?w=490" alt="headandneckline" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/headandneckline.jpg?w=490 490w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/headandneckline.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/headandneckline.jpg?w=300 300w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/headandneckline.jpg 628w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"   /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now try and find the the contours of the sharpening box in this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10051" title="skirt" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt.jpg?w=490" alt="skirt" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt.jpg?w=490 490w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt.jpg?w=300 300w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt.jpg 670w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"   /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That was a trick question, as there are a couple of them in there.  Here&#8217;s one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10052" title="skirt2" src="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt2.jpg?w=490" alt="skirt2" srcset="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt2.jpg?w=490 490w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/skirt2.jpg 670w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"   /></p>
<p>Now, do I think these were deliberately nefarious edits&#8212;that is, do I believe Reuter&#8217;s Jason Reed circulated a photograph of Obama that was touched-up so that it appeared as if the President were sinning in his heart?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Digital photographs are sharpened all the time because of the limitations of digital cameras.  Reed likely saw that photograph, assumed he caught Obama peeking and sharpened the President&#8217;s hand and face because that&#8217;s what you do with hands and faces.</p>
<p>In this case, however, his minor alterations amount to editorial decisions, because the digital artifacts that are so obvious in the high-resolution photograph disappear in the conversion to web-friendlier lower resolutions.  Reed&#8217;s <em>de rigueur</em> sharpening demonstrably changed the meaning of the moment he photographed, in effect <em>creating</em> an incident that never happened.</p>
<p>So perhaps we should be forgiving of Althouse despite her faux-expert and incompetent analysis, because in the photograph she &#8220;analyzed&#8221; it is more difficult&#8212;<a href="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/by-no.jpg">though by no</a> <a href="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/means-impossible.jpg">means impossible</a>&#8212;to see evidence of that digital manipulation.  And I would be, were it not for the fact that once she viewed the video, she knew that Obama was not in a &#8220;stance.&#8221; According to any dictionary you care to consult&#8212;I&#8217;ll go with the <em>OED</em>&#8212;a &#8220;stance&#8221; is a &#8220;a standing-place, station, position,&#8221; from the Italian &#8220;<em>stanza</em>,&#8221; meaning &#8220;stopping place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had she one whit of intellectual honesty, she would have viewed that video and changed her post to indicate that Obama was not in a &#8220;stance,&#8221; because just as one cannot be simultaneously in front of <em>and</em> behind something, one cannot be walking <em>and</em> stopped at the same time.  If I am walking, I am not standing; if I am standing, I am not walking.  Her analysis of his &#8220;stance&#8221; is a not an interpretative error: it is a material one.  Her insistence that her analysis is sound despite this error and evidence to the contrary constitutes a stubbornness in the face of fact that is unbecoming of an academic.</p>
<p>If you take a picture of the moon and claim that the resulting photograph is proof that the moon&#8217;s a stationary object and then someone shows you a video of it moving across the night sky, you cannot claim that your interpretation of the event depicted in the photograph is still valid.  What you are effectively claiming is that <em>the photograph is a photograph</em>, <em>i.e.</em> that it is a still image captured from a moving tableau.  This is not a matter of interpretation, but a description of the medium; to claim otherwise is to deny the very reality to which the photograph pertains . . .</p>
<p>. . .which is precisely what Althouse is doing.  Her analysis of a manipulated photograph trumps reality, and she can&#8217;t be bothered to articulate why exactly that is. But that won&#8217;t stop her (or the hoard of equally incompetent illiterates who base their opinion on her photographic &#8220;expertise&#8221;) from claiming that her &#8220;interpretation&#8221; is still valid. They&#8217;ll be doing that until the moon stops dead in the sky and falls to the stage they&#8217;ve mistaken for the world. I only hope the rest of us abandoned that theater long ago (but remain primed <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200907100012">for the inevitable disappointment</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Update. </strong>Ahistoricality asks two sharp questions: <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/a-stubbornness-in-the-face-of-fact-that-is-unbecoming-of-an-academic.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011571fa0492970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571fa0492970b">first</a>, why a professional photographer would enhance his photograph with the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/adobe/photoshop/tool/marquee.html">rectangular marquee tool</a> (thereby creating boxes) instead of something like the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/adobe/photoshop/tool/magic-wand.html">magic wand</a>. The answer is that he didn&#8217;t have to&#8212;he could have used the more sophisticated tool&#8212;but that the evidence shows that he did.  I suspect this has something to do with how fast he wanted the photograph distributed, as well as the fact that he knew it would be reproduced at lower resolutions, thereby mitigating the visibility of his manipulation.  His <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/a-stubbornness-in-the-face-of-fact-that-is-unbecoming-of-an-academic.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011571fa0737970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571fa0737970b">second question</a> is whether the apparent boxes are a normal effect of compression.  They could be; however, normal compression results in a more <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/a-stubbornness-in-the-face-of-fact-that-is-unbecoming-of-an-academic.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011571fa5bb2970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571fa5bb2970b">evenly distributed pixelation effect</a>, but as you can tell from that link, the box of more highly contrasted pixels is still visible beneath his cuff.</p>

						<p><i>both a fascist and a communist</i></p>
<p>Also a Muslim and Christian.</p>
<p>Thanks, Scott: apparently I&#8217;m just not used to the fast-paced, corner-cutting world of journalistic image-making. I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/search/label/pictures%20by%20ahistoricality" rel="nofollow">working too hard</a>.</p>
<p><i>Her analysis of a manipulated photograph trumps reality, and she can’t be bothered to articulate why exactly that is.</i></p>
<p>If I thought she was being this sophisticated, I might suggest she was engaged in some Barthesian postmodern project in which the free signifier photograph could not only hold meaning in itself though her independent reading but also reveal truth about the signified which hold even when the signifier-in-context cannot be read in such an independent way.</p>
<p>If I were a real postmodernist, I&#8217;d probably argue that the concept of signifier-in-context is itself meaningless: there are only signifiers and the truths we construct from them which are valuable even when they are meaningless to any other reader. This is why I&#8217;m not a postmodernist.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Althouse is, either (at least not that she&#8217;d admit). But it almost fits.</p>

						<p>The more plausible theoretical antecedent is David Horowitz&#8217;s concept of the &#8220;truer truth,&#8221; accessed via non-facts.   It&#8217;s something like Revelation: the physical world won&#8217;t manifest truth directly, but it gives hints to those who know how to read them.</p>

<p>Jason, if you liked that, you should <a href="http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2009/01/comment-elsewhere-and-ten-rules-of.html" rel="nofollow">go to the source</a>. Postmodernism is a great tool, but some of the people who&#8217;ve used it are, to use the vernacular, great tools. </p>
<p>Bphd: This isn&#8217;t a parody, I don&#8217;t think, except perhaps in a very technical sense. If you&#8217;re going to pick on minutiae, there&#8217;s a right way and a wrong way to do it: Althouse did it wrong.</p>

						<p>How can Obama be in front of her, and looking three feet in front, when their feet are on the same step? In fact, he is behind her as she leans forward to put her right foot on the step behind the president. Your analysis misses some obvious clues within the photograph itself.</p>
<p>Even in the video it is not clear that he is not at least starting to look backward until the other woman comes into view and steps down. At that point it IS clear that the president was NEVER looking at the woman who was ascending, Mayara Rodrigues Tavare. He was always looking downward at the step itself and made space for the woman who was following him down, even offering his hand to assist her.</p>
<p>The French president on the other hand&#8230;?</p>

<p>If the central issue is the high-brow diversity of depth-of-field offered by nostalgic, analog cameras versus the flattening and infinite dof representations created by modern digital ones, then isn&#8217;t there a legitimate argument that such cameras are technological instruments of the hyper-real?  Or, similarly, that the nuances of a photograph, and subsequent consultation of photographic theory, will probably still diffuse and persist as a false narrative for untold media cycles to come?</p>
<p>&#8230;That is, unless someone does a post refuting it, or something.</p>

						<p>Look at the left toe of the girl, it is at the bottom of the step and since she is climing up, she is leaning slightly forward and her backside will be in the direction of the camera.  The President&#8217;s heal is also up against that same step and  he is bent at the waist and twisted towards the girl.  His face may not have been directly facing that girl&#8217;s ass, but it was certainly enough in the general direction for eyeball swivel to have corrected for that.</p>
<p>White-hotness of intellectual honesty is a bit much when only a fool would claim certainty as to what Obama saw or didn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>I will say again what I said over at Althouse&#8217;s blog:</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with a brief and discreet gaze at a well-turned ass.</p>
<p>What is amusing is how dedicated the Obama fan-boys are to claiming the picture is somehow a lie. If you want to believe that, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find validation in the video. If like me, you don&#8217;t care, you see from the video that his gaze was short and reasonably discreet. </p>
<p>But we know what he was looking at for at least 1:100 sec.</p>

						<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with putting a little extra effort into something that doesn&#8217;t matter much in the grand scheme of things.  It&#8217;s a good workout for the brain.  Besides, if this topic isn&#8217;t to everyone&#8217;s liking, we could always start another conversation about the relative historical importance of the death of Michael Jackson.</p>

						<p><em>This post does a great job of parodying Althouse’s own obsession with irrelevant minutae. </em></p>
<p>Boo!  Boo!</p>
<p><em>Your analysis misses some obvious clues within the photograph itself.</em></p>
<p>And your questions miss the really obvious points I made about perspective above.  It&#8217;s like you didn&#8217;t read the post, but decided to comment anyway. </p>
<p><em>White-hotness of intellectual honesty is a bit much when only a fool would claim certainty as to what Obama saw or didn’t see . . . But we know what he was looking at for at least 1:100 sec.</em></p>
<p>You know, people may be more convinced by your arguments if you don&#8217;t call yourself a fool.</p>
<p><em>you put a lot of effort into this.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s what I do when I want an answer to a question: I research, I think, then I organize my analysis into something that effectively communicates the fruits of my labor.  That&#8217;s just how responsible behave.  Now, Althouse may be satisfied with looking at something, drinking a couple of glasses of wine, and then &#8220;analyzing&#8221; it, but that&#8217;s not how I was trained to work.</p>
<p><em>The paranoid, obsessive lengths hyperpartisanship pushes an otherwise rational mind…</em></p>
<p>You can always tell when people have read a blog for the first time.  CJC, this is the &#8220;<a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/25/you-asked-for-it-you-got-it/" rel="nofollow">Get disappointed by someone new</a>&#8221; blog, and myself and my co-bloggers have been plenty disappointed these past seven months.  So no, there&#8217;s no hyperpartisanship on display here, nor is there any paranoia.  The post works in four parts: the first outlines the problem, the second describes forced perspective, the third sharpening, and the fourth synthesizes those into an argument.  That&#8217;s called &#8220;thinking through a topic while paying attention to the relevant details.&#8221;  Now, if you want to ding me for doing careful analysis and only drawing conclusions when I can, as my elementary school math teachers would say, &#8220;show my work,&#8221; well then, that&#8217;s a reputation I&#8217;m more than happy to live with.</p>
<p><em>Objections about the triviality of a blog post are not motivated by ennui, but by a desire to change the subject.</em></p>
<p>Give that man another football!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken to pre-emptive meme stamping.  I figure if I can marginalize these idiocies before they have the chance to &#8220;blossom&#8221; into the mainstream a la Lewinsky and the Foster murder, we might could avoid a repeat of the &#8217;90s.  </p>
<p>Granted, I know that I&#8217;m a small voice, but I tell myself that maybe my words will trickle up into Google such that a conservative speech-writer who searches for &#8220;Jack Cashill&#8221; will see that he&#8217;s been discredited and be forced to advance in a different direction.</p>

						<p>Wow, a picture of my kids is Exhibit 1! Nice!</p>
<p>BTW, just a point of clarification, she is innocently swatting at bubbles, not an insect.</p>
<p>And as a self-proclaimed right-wing extremist, I roll my eyes at those who see these sorts of pictures of our President and make such wild accusations. Petty and useless. After all, if we on the Right cannot keep focused on the policy items with which we and the President disagree then we just don&#8217;t have much of an argument, do we?</p>
<p>Heck, even Michelle Malkin dismissed these photo accusations as &#8220;silliness&#8221;.</p>
<p>I might add, that it&#8217;s only some few on the extreme Right swatting at bubbles like this. Kids are easily distracted with such things.</p>
<p>Blessings to all, and thanks again for using my photo.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;ve zero interest in the ogling question but even so, the argument here seems to be full of straw dogs and interpretations that the evidence doesn&#8217;t support.  </p>
<p>(1) The leg shadows of the young woman, the Pres and Sarkozy all seem to indicate that the three were about evenly distant from the step when the shot was taken.  There is nothing in the shot or in the video that really allows one to deduce that he is looking three feet in front of the YW. </p>
<p>(2)The video reinforces that he is looking proximately right below the step as he helps the second YW off the step.</p>
<p>(3)  What source could you have for a &#8220;high resolution&#8221; copy of the picture?  You don&#8217;t indicate where you may have found such a shot.  </p>
<p>(4) I am confused by your &#8220;boxing  &#8221; claim &#8211; perhaps my eyes are no good but I can&#8217;t see the smoothing of the images (even with the Bush one) that you claim.  To my eye, you have blown up low-res images until the pixels appear as squares, which are accentuated when the colors are dramatically different and undistinguishable where the field is pretty much monochrome.</p>
<p>(5)  AFAIK, digital cameras allow the focal point to be nearer or farther away.  If so, I fail to see how you can place the parties with any certainty to the exactness you claim.</p>
<p>In short, I can&#8217;t see that you have proved what you feel you have proved, as much as I was wiliing to be convinced.  Better to say that in the context of the movement that the video provides, if the Pres. was ogling, it was short enough an ogle to satisfy Charlie Ford.</p>

<p>Ah well, since you say so, I must assume your intense interest in this trivial matter is just, um, perhaps a hobby of sorts.  Yes, I see.  You read blogs in a politically disinterested manner, hoping to find logical fallacies you can examine, probe, research and then communicate your findings to us fascinated masses.  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re not a Democrat or some other brand of Obamaphile.  Actually, you chose not to vote for McCain cuz he was too damn lib&#8217;ral&#8230;..right?</p>

						<p>anderson, i think if you watch the video, what you&#8217;ll see is that he was very briefly, for a fraction of a second, checking out her ass or something in its near vicinity. the entire episode was over and done with in milliseconds, and that&#8217;s how much news-time it should have occupied as well. obama acted with complete self-control and class, without it interfering with his gracious attendance to his official business and his other guests, and with perfect dignity. </p>
<p>unlike that genuine ass, sarkozy, who is craning around and rubbernecking like an impulsive seven year old at a toy store. he&#8217;s probably just delighted to see a woman shorter than he is. when he wants to ogle carla&#8217;s behind, he needs to borrow a step-ladder.</p>
<p>look, unless for some reason you think your presidential ideal must be completely impervious to transient appetites, you are not going to see this as evidence of a moral flaw.  </p>
<p>and, no, the stuff about focal planes and perspective does not make any sense, but then sek is the expert.</p>

						<p>I make no attempt to defend any of Ann Althouse&#8217;s statements, nor can I comprehend why anyone would spend so much time on them. But having seen the photo and video, I still maintain that Obama was in fact, checking out the young lady&#8217;s tush. If you watch the video, Obama never looks at the other girl behind him as he helps her negotiate the step. Normally (having been in a similar position myself once or twice), the first thing you would do is look at the person you were helping to make sure they grab your hand as you will be supporting some of their weight when they step down. The only reason you wouldn&#8217;t look at them is if you were distracted by something else. What the something else was in this case is pretty darn obvious, and Sarkozy&#8217;s grin makes it clear that he drew the same conclusion as an *eyewitness*, not from photo or video!</p>
<p>And no, I am not saying this in order to attack the President. Although I am far from a supporter of his, I think he is only human and it is not a big deal at all if he notices a shapely female.</p>

						<p><em>BTW, just a point of clarification, she is innocently swatting at bubbles, not an insect.</em></p>
<p>When you lived in the South as long as I did, the assumption is always insects.  I&#8217;ll correct that, though.</p>
<p><em>I confess, I’m a little puzzled by how SEK’s argument accounts for their being on the same step.</em></p>
<p>They are, but it&#8217;s a wide step on a curved stage in a photograph where you can&#8217;t tell from perspective.  </p>
<p><em>What source could you have for a “high resolution” copy of the picture? You don’t indicate where you may have found such a shot.</em></p>
<p>I linked to a higher resolution shot, but I can&#8217;t link to <a href="http://gallery.pictopia.com/reuters/gallery/44713/photo/reuters:8316261/?o=1" rel="nofollow">the highest resolution</a> because it&#8217;s a dynamic link.  (That one will take you to as close as you can get.)</p>
<p><em>I am confused by your “boxing ” claim – perhaps my eyes are no good but I can’t see the smoothing of the images (even with the Bush one) that you claim. To my eye, you have blown up low-res images until the pixels appear as squares, which are accentuated when the colors are dramatically different and undistinguishable where the field is pretty much monochrome.</em></p>
<p>Look at Bush&#8217;s chin in the second photograph.  Can you see how the sharpening (which I did with the marquee tool, which creates the appearance of the box) increased the contrast between adjacent colors on his face?  Even a pretty much monochrome color will be affected by sharpening: look at the black area below the top line of the square in the last picture, then compare it to the black area above.  Can you see the difference?</p>
<p><em>AFAIK, digital cameras allow the focal point to be nearer or farther away. If so, I fail to see how you can place the parties with any certainty to the exactness you claim.</em></p>
<p>Even if I&#8217;m wrong (which, I admit, is possible), I at least modeled a sound mode of analysis: I didn&#8217;t begin by naively assuming that the photograph was a transparent depiction of what happened.  Althouse&#8217;s argument could be brushed off in these two paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Had she one whit of intellectual honesty, she would have viewed that video and changed her post to indicate that Obama was not in a “stance,” because just as one cannot be simultaneously in front of and behind something, one cannot be walking and stopped at the same time. If I am walking, I am not standing; if I am standing, I am not walking. Her analysis of his “stance” is a not an interpretative error: it is a material one. Her insistence that her analysis is sound despite this error and evidence to the contrary constitutes a stubbornness in the face of fact that is unbecoming of an academic.</p>
<p>If you take a picture of the moon and claim that the resulting photograph is proof that the moon’s a stationary object and then someone shows you a video of it moving across the night sky, you cannot claim that your interpretation of the event depicted in the photograph is still valid. What you are effectively claiming is that the photograph is a photograph, i.e. that it is a still image captured from a moving tableau. This is not a matter of interpretation, but a description of the medium; to claim otherwise is to deny the very reality to which the photograph pertains</p></blockquote>
<p>I was more interested in the technical issues, and it just happened that this was how I can to investigate it&#8212;much like when I became interested in cinematography and used <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html" rel="nofollow">the material I was teaching</a> to investigate that.  So while I may be wrong (and have used some confusing terminology), I went about becoming wrong the correct way and had some fascinating conversations with professional photographers and graphic designers in the process.  That may strike some people as a waste of time, but I enjoyed it because I enjoy learning.</p>
<p><em>I must assume your intense interest in this trivial matter is just, um, perhaps a hobby of sorts . . . You read blogs in a politically disinterested manner, hoping to find logical fallacies you can examine, probe, research and then communicate your findings to us fascinated masses. I’m sure you’re not a Democrat or some other brand of Obamaphile . . .</em></p>
<p>My interest in this matter is my interest in this matter.  That you think I&#8217;m a hyperpartisan is a reflection of your own blinkered stupidity: someone either is an &#8220;Obamaphile&#8221; or not.  I introduced a third term into your silly binary in my initial response, and either you ignored it or, more likely, were unable to understand it.  That&#8217;s because the world you choose to live in is childish in its moral simplicity&#8212;but I don&#8217;t live in that world, nor does anyone else with brains enough to think.  If you have anything substantive to add to this conversation, by all means, add it; but if you&#8217;re here to remind the rest us that people like you someone survived long enough to learn how to type, I&#8217;d rather you took your sad act somewhere else.</p>
<p><em>look, unless for some reason you think your presidential ideal must be completely impervious to transient appetites, you are not going to see this as evidence of a moral flaw.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it as evidence of a moral flaw, but more and more I&#8217;m seeing evidence of the monstrous moralism that slouched toward Washington and turned into the Lewinsky affair.  People spent the &#8217;90s ignoring these baby idiocies and the next thing you know, they impeached the President for lying to his wife about a hummer.</p>

						<p>As a 74 year old dude, I have some problems understanding just what is wrong with giving beautiful women the proper consideration of their beauty.<br />
I took the grand daughter down to the Sacramento airport to see her off home to Portland and to pass the time, about an hour, I checked out every woman passing by.  The great thing about my age is that no woman considers me &#8220;dangerous&#8221;.  Of course, they are correct.  HooRay for the better sex.</p>

						<p><em>Does this link work?</em></p>
<p>It does!  But, for the record, that&#8217;s not where I got the image I used above and don&#8217;t have access to the computer with the photographic tools on it (<em>i.e.</em> the wife&#8217;s), so I can&#8217;t double-check my results just yet.</p>
<p><em>you’d rather insist that he is immaculate, rather than, say, challenging the rules of that particular game?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not insisting he&#8217;s immaculate: but I do want to set the record straight before conservatives momentum it into a narrative that the media feels compelled to take seriously.  That happened in the &#8217;90s through the vast paper-and-pastor network that evangelicized the conservative movement; given that pastors now grab their material off the internet, and their parishioners respond with material they&#8217;ve grabbed, it seems the higher the quality of the refutation, the more likely people will be to see faux-rage for what it is.</p>

						<p>Baloney!  It is quite clear from the video that he is moving down and planning to accept the hand of the woman next to him.  HOWEVER, he does a clear double take as the ass goes by, and lingers on it just a hair too long before composing himself.  The strained denial above just makes you seem like a pantywaist, for what is wrong with taking a subtle gander like that.  I&#8217;d worry more if he didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>So two posts in six years <em>is</em> evidence of an obsession?  Well alright then, I confess: I am obsessed.</p>
<p><em>The strained denial above . . .</em></p>
<p>The thing about the internet is, it&#8217;s very easy to create misconceptions, but very difficult to refute them once they&#8217;ve gained some traction.  Case in point: your comment.  </p>

						<p>I read this post as an exercise in assessing photographic images for evidentiary purposes. I&#8217;m not sure the subject matter is the only topic of interest here. I actually do have concerns with the President of the United States checking out a 16-year-old girl&#8217;s @$$ on live television. Of course, I wouldn&#8217;t have these reservations if she was two years older. Thank you to the minutiae of law and God bless America.</p>

<p>Absolutely!  As I said above, it doesn&#8217;t take more than two paragraphs to discredit Althouse: the more interesting issue, and what I spent the bulk of the post investigating, concerned the reliability of visual evidence.  Of course, some people might find such stuff banal, but personally, I&#8217;m fascinated by it.</p>

						<p>The thing about this nonsense is that the young woman in question, and her family, are being put through the wringer, and what should have been a wonderful moment in what sounds like a pretty hard life has now been trashed. For, as you show, nothing but an obvious cheap shot. <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/07122009/news/worldnews/folks__o__for_shame__178798.htm" rel="nofollow">NY Post</a> article is even more despicable than most NY Post articles, and intensely depressing.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t buy the abstract idea that dishonesty like Althouse&#8217;s should be given a response because it just should be, well, consider that stuff like that almost always features a human being getting hurt by it.</p>

						<p>Good catch. But frankly speaking, does it really matter if Obama was checking a girl out anyway? I dont think it does. We are all human. Anyone and everyone can be faulted for something.  Its absurd to even care in the first place. Its not like he is chocking a baby who wont stop crying&#8230; he is doing nothing illegal nor immoral but acting as an animal would (we are all animals). Even if you believe in God &#8211; we all sin and we are all tempted by the Devil.  The fact that a man looks at a woman isnt sinful in my book. Now, if he had hit on the girl, asked her out, or masturbated to the thought, or any other sort of entertainment of the sin from succumbing to temptation to dwelling in the thought of his own will&#8230; that would be wrong from a Christian perspective.  Merely having a passing animal instinct (one seeded by the Devil) is not something you can fault anyone for.</p>

						<p>Even if Obama did stare at that girl&#8217;s ass SO WHAT?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be surprised if he DIDN&#8217;T check her out </p>
<p>I know if i was standing where he was, I&#8217;d be totally checking her out &#8211; and yes, Cogito Ergo Cogito Sum, I&#8217;d be &#8220;masturbat[ing] to the thought&#8221; of her ass later that evening!

						<p>SEK,</p>
<p>This is a good example of an accidental forced perspective shot, making it appear, in the photograph, that a man is looking up the skirt of a Marilyn Monroe statue. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42873250@N00/3596463294/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/42873250@N00/3596463294/</a></p>
<p>The reality is that he is looking at his supervisor, whom I had cropped out of the picture in order to achieve the proper &#8220;naughty&#8221; look to the picture.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen any interviews with the AP photog, but I know that very often I see pictures that I have taken which when viewed a certain way have the effect of showing an event that did not actually happen. I can&#8217;t imagine that he was unaware of how the picture LOOKED (in my opinion he HAD to be aware) and probably chuckled mildly when he submitted it, then went on taking more pictures.</p>
<p>One thing that is for sure about photographs: they are thin slices out of time, and usually omit the greater context. But IMO they almost always tell the story that the photographer wants to tell.</p>

						<p>Althouse is an embarassment and the video is dispositive, but we already knew that.  </p>
<p>The only part of SEK&#8217;s post I&#8217;m not buying is the depth of field.  The girl can be no further from the higher step than the length of her thigh, because she&#8217;s about to step up.  Obama is down from the higher step.  He can&#8217;t be more than a foot further away from the photographer than the girl, and more likely is parallel to the girl or slightly closer to the photographer.  I have trouble understanding how a maximum one-foot distance could explain differential focus.  I don&#8217;t think the photo supports SEK&#8217;s argument that Obama is further away than the girl.</p>

<p>agreed. and i would think (subject to correction by people who know stuff) this gets all the less likely, the further back we put the camera.</p>
<p>that is, i would imagine that depth-of-field is going to be partly determined by distance from lens. at close ranges, maybe my elbow can be in focus while my hand is out of focus. but at 50 ft, 100 ft, etc., that gets decreasingly likely. any info on how far back the photog was when shooting this?</p>

						<p><em>Good God, SEK, you used “momentum as a verb!</em></p>
<p><em>Buffy</em> fans whedon words.  Deal.</p>
<p><em>Only his white half could be interested in so modest a booty.</em></p>
<p>Once homophobia arrived, I knew racism wouldn&#8217;t be far behind&#8230;</p>
<p><em>consider that stuff like that almost always features a human being getting hurt by it.</em></p>
<p>As usual, Thers nails it: our talking point is someone else&#8217;s undeserved disaster.  In this case, that person was guilty of <em>walking</em>, and if the pattern I described above about the &#8217;90s obtains, those will be some steps she wish she never walked.  (All in the name of a higher morality, of course.  We don&#8217;t destroy someone for anything less.)</p>
<p><em>Merely having a passing animal instinct (one seeded by the Devil) is not something you can fault anyone for.</em></p>
<p>I agree with you in principle&#8212;people living under strictures shouldn&#8217;t be faulted for their humanity&#8212;but that won&#8217;t stop conservatives from claiming this as a moment of high hypocrisy at some future time, which is what I&#8217;m aiming to avoid.</p>
<p><em>Does everything have to be so God damned politically correct now that a middle age man can’t even check out a hot girl’s butt?</em></p>
<p>If we grant the moral argument, I&#8217;d say that it&#8217;s not political correctness that dictates our objections.  Look, 60 percent of my students are females between the ages of 18 and 21, and if I had one of them write their thesis statements on the whiteboard and oogled her ass while she was doing it, you&#8217;d be offended in a way that had nothing to do with political correctness.  I&#8217;d have violated a basic moral principle and you&#8217;d be right to censure me for doing so.  </p>
<p><em>But IMO they almost always tell the story that the photographer wants to tell.</em></p>
<p>Absolutely.  That&#8217;s what I was getting at by not indicting Reed.  I mean, yes, he created an event that never happened, but I don&#8217;t think he did so deliberately . . . and I don&#8217;t extend the benefit of that doubt to everyone.  </p>
<p><em>I don’t think the photo supports SEK’s argument that Obama is further away than the girl.</em></p>
<p>Two things, Brian: one, I&#8217;m throwing an argument out there for folks to agree or disagree with, as opposed to claiming something along the lines of &#8220;Do you believe me or your lying eyes?&#8221;  Two, I&#8217;m more than happy to be proven wrong; that is, if you can provide convincing evidence that I&#8217;m misinterpreted the <em>mise-en-scène</em>, I&#8217;m willing to listen.  As I said, I&#8217;m here for the learning, so any wisdom you care to impart will find a happy audience.</p>

<p>Nope.  As I noted <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/a-stubbornness-in-the-face-of-fact-that-is-unbecoming-of-an-academic.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0115710a0fc0970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115710a0fc0970c" rel="nofollow">at my place</a>, I went with a depth-of-field problem over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_distortion_(photography)" rel="nofollow">perspective distortion</a> precisely because I couldn&#8217;t confirm what sort of lens the photographer used (and thus, how far away he was when he shot).  For example:</p>
<p><em>this gets all the less likely, the further back we put the camera.</em></p>
<p>A telephoto lens will compress the objects in the photograph, making them all look like Batman smooching Robin, whereas a wide-angle lens will clean that funny book right up.  I could make an educated guess as to what I think Jason Reed shot that picture with, but I decided to go with what I could prove definitively since I&#8217;m not an expert in all matters photographic.</p>

						<p>i realize that the nature of the lens also affects the depth of focus (that&#8217;s why i said &#8220;partly determined&#8221;). </p>
<p>but holding fixed the type of lens (telephoto or w/a), and even holding fixed the particular lens, i was suggesting that the number of feet in the depth-of-focus volume, i.e. from front to back (in a right line from the eye, as berkeley would say), is greater at a further distance from the lens.</p>
<p>e.g., i&#8217;m pretty sure that a w/a lens will not &#8220;clean that funny book right up&#8221; if we are photographing the night sky. star 1 looks just as sharp as star 2, even though one is light years behind the other, cause they&#8217;re both light years from the lens.</p>

						<p>This Right-Wing Extremist notes that too many of you are losing grip on reality by entertaining arguments that are immaterial, because the event <em>didn&#8217;t happen.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t accept the premise, because that premise is not based on fact!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a valid debate to continue on with discussing our President&#8217;s human foibles in light of the fact that he did not exhibit any.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t our focus be on the Sotomayer hearings, or the 1,018 page health care reform bill that is just now being unveiled?</p>
<p>While I understand the underlying need to squelch the potential accusations that are apparent from an unstudied view of that photo before they become actual accusations, the offspring of this discussion is naught but a bastard child of thought.</p>
<p>Whether it would matter if President Obama ogles young ladies even for the most insanely briefest of moments is only relevant when or IF that happens. But in that picture, it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve got my evidence, that Obama is unlikely to be further away from the photographer (and impossible to be more than a foot away) because the girl is stepping up to a step that&#8217;s behind him, and so it&#8217;s more likely that Obama is even with or slightly in front of the girl.</p>

						<p>&#8220;Accidental forced perspective happens because auto-focusing cameras increase the depth of field and flatten the picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>I basically stopped reading at that point, the ignorance or bullshit level a bit more than I could bear. Modern digital cameras do tend to have very small sensors (not so with the recent &#8220;pro&#8221; level cameras) and those use lenses with shorter focal lengths which tend to give the impression of greater depth of field, though that effect is countered somewhat by the need for increased enlargement for equivalent display dimensions.</p>
<p>I see the argument much more in terms of what Alfred Hitchcock described as a director&#8217;s ability to make an actor seem better than he or she actually is. I think the example Hitchcock gave was of an image of a man smiling followed by two possible other images. If the follow up image is of a provocatively dressed woman the viewer assumes the actor&#8217;s smile is lascivious in nature. If the follow up image is of a baby, the assumption is of a paternal nature.</p>
<p>The video suggests that Obama wasn&#8217;t checking booty but if one wants to push a viewpoint it&#8217;s there for the pushing. The question is whether the interpretation says more about the viewer than the subject.</p>
<p>Ironically my first impression on looking at the image was that Obama was checking out Chelsea Clinton, who used to and maybe still does wear her hair in the crinkle iron style. Now that would be ..<br />
noteworthy?</p>
