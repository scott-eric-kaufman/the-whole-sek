<p>I don&#8217;t need to speak to your supervisor <em>thank you very much. </em>But I would like an answer.  Because you know what I think?  Your addiction to torture porn has become so all-consuming it now encompasses its opposite: reverse torture porn.</p>
<p>For almost six years, you&#8217;ve drifted off to sleep play-acting Jack Bauer.  A dark foreigner planted a ticking bomb in a Major American City and only you can discover its location before millions die.  You tumesce at first thought of the necessary force this mission requires.  Which method will you use?  You weigh the pros and cons of all the law allows, but the bomb is ticking, so you consider those it forbids.  You delight in cataloging the sadistic acts the situation necessitates.  Your decision made, you apply the screws, water, electricity, heat, cold, Manilow, &amp;c.  You save America.  You are a hero.  Men want to be you, women to be with you.  You fall asleep.</p>
<p>But just as legal coercion lost its luster, so too have the techniques implemented outside the law.  You can do no more harm to these imagined bodies without imagining yourself a murderer, so you shift from the torturer to the tortured.  Where before the tortured man made war upon America, in John McCain, mind and body are broken in its service.  Your heart swells with pride when you consider his sacrifice.  Your beloved car battery acquires menace, as the means by which you once saved America nightly becomes the means by which they would have you betray it.</p>
<p>You are now addicted to reverse torture porn, and John McCain is your enabler.  You are incapable of thinking about politics outside a primal scene of human suffering.  You shape your policy in rooms whose walls perspire, on improvised furniture carelessly shat on a bloodstained concrete floor, and you ignore the damnable hypocrisy of it all.**  Whatever McCain learned in a hole like this qualifies him to lead the free world.  We teach terrorists something different.</p>
<p>What exactly?  I don&#8217;t know.  You don&#8217;t either.  But it&#8217;s categorically different than what McCain learned, whatever that was; and whatever that was, it is now a quality desired in a President; and because whatever it is, Obama lacks it, McCain is the better candidate.</p>
<p>I think that about covers it.</p>
<hr /><span style="font-size:x-small;">*The comparison doesn&#8217;t work because, as Clark himself said: &#8220;Barack is not—he is not running on the fact that he has made these national security pronouncements. He&#8217;s running on his other strengths. He&#8217;s running on the strengths of character, on the strengths of his communication skills, on the strengths of his judgment—and those are qualities that we seek in our national leadership.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">**Overwritten, certainly, but considering I initially wrote &#8220;walls perspire fungal rot,&#8221; you should be thankful I somehow managed to rein myself in.<br />

						<p>I don&#8217;t think that anyone&#8217;s arguing that McCain&#8217;s having been shot down or tortured qualifies him for the presidency.  Anyway, it would be absurd if they did.  It&#8217;s a red herring, obviously.  </p>

<p>I know it worked for me in a different context.  Our CEO was an engineer at the very beginning of his career and we technical folk would have jumped out of airplanes for him before lifting a finger for the pointed haired marketing VP.  And it wasn&#8217;t just his title and rank.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a valid point &#8212; if you take away military service as a means of qualifying candidates, you&#8217;re left with something else.  But that&#8217;s not what a lot of people are doing: they&#8217;re applauding military service-qua-military service in order to discount those something elses, whatever they are.</p>

						<p>My current post at Signaleer explains why what you are waiting for is a response to a strawman.  You, SEK, could be forgiven for not knowing the ins and outs of Senator McCain&#8217;s Naval carreer.  The General, however cannot.</p>

						<p>RTO, could you explain, chapter and verse, what General Clark said that was wrong.  I&#8217;m being totally serious; I&#8217;d really like you to help me out.  Because it seems to me that Clark spoke very highly of Senator McCain&#8217;s service &#8212; describing him as a hero and an inspiration &#8212; but also suggested that McCain&#8217;s experiences in Vietnam don&#8217;t necessarily qualify him to be president.  I&#8217;m not sure why this offends anyone.</p>

						<p>It&#8217;s inherently demeaning. For the media to be all taking Wesley Clark seriously on political issues to the denigration of John McCain&#8217;s experience would be like if McCain sent Howie Mandel to comment on Baracky&#8217;s sacred hopeyness. It just doesn&#8217;t make any sense on the face of it. Wesley Clark &#8216;s entire career is based on his stint as a CNN newsbabe. Positioning him as some sort of serious commenter is just ridiculous I think.</p>

						<p>Wow, happyfeet, you might want to read a bit about General Clark&#8217;s service, particularly in combat in Vietnam, before saying unbelievably stupid things in public.  Oh wait, you&#8217;re using a pseudonym that you stole from a singing and dancing penguin.  Well, that explains that.  Unless you are a penguin.  In which case, how are you typing?</p>

						<p>It&#8217;s WordPress with its automatic pingbacks.  I was trying to hide my scathing criticism <em>here</em> from all these knuckleheads (by trackbacking to <em>Acephalous</em>), but WordPress went and made them for me.  (That said, happyfeet&#8217;s good people.)</p>
<p><em>You, SEK, could be forgiven for not knowing the ins and outs of Senator McCain’s Naval carreer.</em></p>
<p>Why (besides the obvious) do people assume I don&#8217;t know things.  <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/knowing-the-rest-of-the-story-is-half-the-battle/" rel="nofollow">I know things</a>!  But I&#8217;m not sure what this means <em>vis-a-vis</em> the qualifications desired in a Commander in Chief.</p>
<p><em>Wesley Clark ’s entire career is based on his stint as a CNN newsbabe. Positioning him as some sort of serious commenter is just ridiculous I think.</em></p>
<p>happy, I&#8217;m not saying he&#8217;s a serious commenter &#8212; granted, I&#8217;d argue, based on his record, that he is &#8212; I&#8217;m asking people to judge his statement on its merit.  They&#8217;re not doing that.  I still haven&#8217;t seen anyone present the reasons what special dispensation his military service grants him.  I&#8217;d like to, you know, because that&#8217;d be an argument, and I can argue with those.</p>

<p>Wesley Clark managed the one American military victory in the last 15 years that remained, unequivocally, an American victory.  That strikes me as a pretty reasonable career.</p>

						<p>My apologies&#8211;especially to happyfeet.</p>
<p>As for credibility with the troops, perhaps one should refer to <a href="http://www.examiner.com/a-1467662~Military_see_presidential_race_through_own_lens.html?cid=rss-Politics" rel="nofollow">this</a> before assuming credibility with the troops&#8211;the current generation, at least, seems quite willing to donate to Obama&#8217;s campaign.

						<p>Well, credibility isn&#8217;t the end all and be all of leadership, but its something.  And its something that doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with torture porn.  Wasn&#8217;t that the challenge you presented, or did I misunderstand?</p>
<p>Anyway, with an incredible leader, troops (and other subordinates) may not desert but they&#8217;re more likely to shirk.  If you don&#8217;t think the boss knows what he/she is talking about, you&#8217;re not going to be very motivated to do what he/she says.</p>

						<p>Okay, pushmedia, then we&#8217;re in the same boat.  Also, before anything else gets said, let me note that I think McCain&#8217;s service was admirable and heroic.  Still and all, soldiers look up to a commander in chief with excellent judgment.  That was and is my point main.  Lincoln and FDR had that kind of judgment, history suggests, though neither of them ever served in the armed forces.</p>
<p>And RTO, I can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re ignoring me or just aren&#8217;t able to explain what, exactly, was so offensive about Clark&#8217;s statements.</p>

						<p>One more thing, pushmedia:  although I think that McCain served admirably, heroically even, in Vietnam, I don&#8217;t think that his service qualifies him to be commander in chief &#8212; as I argued in a post earlier today.  Which isn&#8217;t to say that I don&#8217;t follow your point.  I just think that judgment, rather than a heroic war record, is a more useful way of deepening the loyalty of American troops.  Which loyalty, it should be said, isn&#8217;t really in doubt.  At least I hope not.</p>

						<p>Okay, RTO, I read your post.  And I&#8217;m still not seeing the source of all the fuss.  I&#8217;m not sure where how you&#8217;re sourcing your claim that McCain ordered bombs dropped.  Beyond that, yes, it does seem that Clark undersold McCain&#8217;s command experience.  That&#8217;s too bad.  Really, I wish Clark hadn&#8217;t done that.  And I&#8217;m grateful to you for correcting the record.  But perhaps Clark said that because he was SACEUR.  So, next to him, McCain really doesn&#8217;t have command experience.  </p>
<p>Again, though, the real issue is that great warriors don&#8217;t necessarily make great presidents.  The two skill sets are not the same.  This was Clark&#8217;s point, I think.</p>

						<p>More seriously, as silbey&#8217;s point makes clear, and mooting pretty much this whole discussion, a military record matters to conservatives only when it&#8217;s a conservative&#8217;s military record.  Kerry&#8217;s was, of course, a disqualification among conservatives, and Jimmy Carter&#8217;s didn&#8217;t win him any prizes, either.  Reagan&#8217;s lack of a meaningful one didn&#8217;t hurt him, nor did Goldwater&#8217;s.</p>
<p>So we could shorten this whole, metastasizing conversation if RTO would just admit that when it comes right down to it, he doesn&#8217;t think McCain&#8217;s military record is all that important, either.  He has the more conservative stance on the issues, and that&#8217;s why RTO doesn&#8217;t want to see him criticized &#8212; by Wes Clark or anybody else.</p>

						<p>Right, morale and loyalty aren&#8217;t the same thing. Did I say they were?  Morale, I&#8217;m guessing, probably goes way down when soldiers are asked to fight a war of choice without the best equipment and then are stop-lossed because of the vanity of a misguided Secretary of Defense.  But hey, Senator McCain thinks this is a great war.  He believes it should continue for another century.  So I&#8217;m sure that he&#8217;ll be a hit with the boys in the field.  </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;most loyal&#8221; you describe, I weep for them.</p>

						<p>&#8220;Douglas?&#8221;  The dude that lost to Lincoln.  The point is military service didn&#8217;t matter in the election of FDR or Lincoln because their opponents lacked a service record, too.  The comparison is salient in this case.</p>

						<p>You didn&#8217;t read the text of the Navy Commendation Medal citation?</p>
<p>&#8220;In the face of heavy enemy fire, he led his section in the attack and placed his bombs directly on target, thereby inflicting major damage to his assigned area.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that was GEN Clark&#8217;s point he should say as much rather than waiting for others to put the words in his mouth.  If he would, I&#8217;d have nothing to say as that point is indisputably and demonstrably true.  IMO, GEN Clark would have been an excellent example of that, himself, had he not been weeded out by the process.  Well, not <i>nothing</i> to say&#8211;he certainly said otherwise when supporting SEN Kerry for President and I&#8217;d probably pont that out.</p>
<p>As for Lincoln, the claim was that he never served.  Some, even Little, is not the same as None.</p>
<p>For that matter, even FDR, had been exposed to the practices of the Naval service as Secretary of the Navy, prior to becoming President.</p>

						<p>Ari, you&#8217;re doing a good job of conflating the issues.</p>
<p>You brought up loyalty when I was talking about morale: &#8220;&#8230;more useful way of deepening the loyalty of American troops.&#8221;  Now you bring up the merits of the war.  What the hell are we talking about?</p>
<p>The point of the thread, I thought, was to speculate on why McCain&#8217;s military service record might matter other than to assuage pornographic desire.  Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>If, in fact, the point was to do some cheerleading than I&#8217;m down.  </p>
<p>*rah, rah*</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think it would useful to ponder our opponent&#8217;s somewhat formidable strengths.</p>

						<p>BTW, RTO, if I were you, I&#8217;d be feeling a bit ganged up on right about now.  My first comment to you was more shrill than polite, which I apologize for.  As for the ganging up, we don&#8217;t get many conservatives through here, so when you showed up, everybody had points they wanted to make or questions they wanted to ask you.</p>
<p>I blame ari for the lack of conservatives here.  A man with eric&#8217;s military bearing would obviously draw them like flies, if not for the Canadian with the left-wing glasses.</p>

						<p>Okay, RTO, I get it.  But like I said above, I&#8217;m not convinced.  I see this whole idiotic &#8220;controversy&#8221; as a case where McCain partisans, and their patsies in the press, are turning nothing into something.  Clark said that McCain&#8217;s experience in Vietnam doesn&#8217;t qualify him to be president.  Clark also said that McCain&#8217;s experience in Vietnam was heroic and inspirational.  Clark was right on both counts.  In other words, while I&#8217;m willing to grant that Clark might have made a minor mistake or two on the facts, which is lamentable, the substance of what he said was absolutely accurate.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we&#8217;ll have to agree to disagree.</p>

						<p><em>Kabul. You?</em></p>
<p>So why aren&#8217;t you running for president?</p>
<p>The point is, McCain&#8217;s service makes him no more qualified for the presidency than mine does (six years Marine Corps Reserve&#8211;thankfully all served stateside)&#8211;as McCain himself has said (see my comments above).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to slight your service&#8211;I think Kabul was the proper place for US military personnel in 2004. Iraq was not&#8211;and is not.</p>

<p>Oh, I don&#8217;t know. A lot of people look at McSame, and see Bush&#8211;which is why he&#8217;s running behind in the polls, despite the bruising Democratic primary. So,  I  think that a great many people in this  country see McCain having bad judgement.</p>

						<p>If GEN Clark had left it at &#8220;McCain&#8217;s experince in Vietnam doesnt&#8217; qualify him to be President&#8221; I&#8217;d not have had a quibble.  Instead he also blatantly threw out his Squadron Command with the &#8220;not a wartime unit&#8221; garbage.  Sorry, but war expericne counts or it doesn&#8217;t and that&#8217;s clearly an attempt to have it both ways.</p>
<p>Which is what lead me to look farther into it.  You say it&#8217;s a regretable slip on a fact or two and I say it&#8217;s a major discourtesy between two military professionals over something as base as politics.</p>
<p>And my dislike for GEN Clark goes back farther than his political aspirations, so I&#8217;ll cop to that too.</p>
<p>As for my answer to where I was, seriously I was at Camp Phoenix outside Kabul in &#8217;03 and &#8217;04.  Was my answer snarky and brusque?  Yep.  Was the question it answered?  Damn straight.  It was an attempt to put me in my place (or that&#8217;s how I saw it if it wasn&#8217;t the intent), so I can&#8217;t credit being too suprised by it.</p>
<p>And if you think that should or could insulate me from a damn thing, that&#8217;s entirely on you and nothing to do with me.</p>

						<p>Wow.  It really does.  I can tell who said what and how many of you there actually are.</p>
<p>Vance, I can&#8217;t speak for the McCain camp and the media can blow my big toe.  I have <i>my</i> objections.  And I&#8217;m open to the idea that my biggest objection could be to the messenger in this case, though he&#8217;s made it awfully easy for me to complain about this message.</p>
<p>GEN Clark&#8217;s essential point is not objectionable, in my opinion.  His delivery of it, however, is dismissive and disrespectful and requires an exceptionally narrow focus to remain unobjectionable, which also makes it almost certainly disingenuous or, at best, negligent.</p>

						<p>Ah, well, I&#8217;ve seen the Johnson and Johnson &#8220;Bandaid&#8221; brand package that had them.  I got a box for Christmas one year in fact.  The traditional long bandages were all woodland camouflage and the small, usually round, ones, were &#8220;purple hearts.&#8221;  Just assumed that&#8217;s where they came from.</p>

						<p>RTO, if you&#8217;re still around, will you answer something for me?  Above, you talk about &#8220;discourtesy between two military professionals.&#8221;  But neither Clark nor McCain is a military professional now.  They&#8217;re both politicians.  And given that, why is it okay for McCain to use his service to advance his political career but not okay for Clark to suggest that doing so makes no sense?</p>

						<p>The provenance of the bandaids is a side issue.  At least you&#8217;re grudgingly acknowledging that it was distasteful for the GOP delegates to mock Kerry&#8217;s service &#8212; just as you&#8217;ve grudgingly acknowledged that Clark&#8217;s widely repeated comment did not actually denigrate McCain&#8217;s service.

						<p>You, of course, can&#8217;t judge for certain, but I&#8217;ll tell you that I&#8217;d respond the same way even if there were not an election involved.</p>
<p>Grudgingly will I vote for McCain.  I find SEN Obama to be an empty suit and fear that faced with a genuine crisis he would fail to act in a timely fashion, if at all.  He cannot point to a single life experience that would indicate otherwise, or if he can, has thus far failed to do so. (Or I&#8217;ve missed it.)</p>
<p>To my thinking this is the single meaningful measure of who I would vote for for President.  I am thoroughly dismayed that only Senators, the least qualified batch (in my opinion) of all elected officials for the Presidency are on the slate.</p>

						<p>RTO, you must vote for Obama, despite your worries.  We are already in a crisis, one that McCain has shown no interest in.  The US has been the most successful country in the world for most of the last century.  If you want that to continue, your only option is to vote for Obama.  The source of America&#8217;s might, including its military might, is economic.  On our current course, that economic supremacy is imperiled.  The US&#8217;s engagement in Iraq is unsustainable; the government&#8217;s finances are beginning to spiral out of control.  The economy is reeling under the shock of 100 dollars a barrel oil; the nation&#8217;s banks are in danger of going under.  McCain shows no interest in any of this, except Iraq, and his policy of open-ended involvement is exactly the wrong one.  We are on the same road as ancien regime France and Weimar Germany; this election is our last chance to get off.</p>
<p>In some ways, I find McCain an admirable figure.  I voted for him in the 2000 primaries over Bush.  But he is the wrong man for the time.</p>

						<p>After the campaign, most of what a President actually does is policy, not crisis-response.  Brief executive brushes with fate (Cuban missiles, etc.) are pretty rare &#8212; even our favorite war examples, the Lincolns and Roosevelts, are remembered and judged for how they prosecuted the war over periods of years, in open political engagement with the legislative branch.

						<p>To get back to SEK&#8217;s original post&#8230;.</p>
<p>I think his reflections on torture are clever, but wrong. I, too, am sickened by our current, bipartisan acceptance, and in some cases celebration, of torture.</p>
<p>But as this thread suggests, what is driving the controversy over Clark&#8217;s comments are larger ideas about military service not ideas about torture.  And as the very carefully couched discussion in this thread suggests, the &#8220;left&#8221; today has a very difficult time constructing a coherent critique of the military and of militarism in general.</p>
<p>Just to put my cards on the table here:</p>
<p>I believe that a military is a necessity. In that sense I am not a pacifist. However, our military is far too large and is often used in ways to which I am deeply opposed.</p>
<p>People in the military deserve our respect like others who are willing to risk their lives to serve their community (e.g. firefighters). But, as was noted in a different thread, courage in one arena does not necessarily translate into courage in another. And effective leadership in one sphere is not necessarily the same thing as effective leadership in another.  Just as being a firefighter does not necessarily make one especially well-prepared to be president of the United States, being a member of the armed forces does not necessarily make one especially well-prepared for that position.</p>
<p>Since the military is under civilian control, they are not, in their capacity as members of the armed forces, responsible for where they are. It think it&#8217;s irrational to feel better about RTO T&#8217;s service because he was in Afghanistan not Iraq. He didn&#8217;t choose where he would be sent.  On the other hand, members of the military and veterans are also citizens and, like all citizens, they share responsibility for policies that they back with their voices and their votes.</p>
<p>I think we as a nation throw too much money at the military, expect our military to be the answer to far too many of the world&#8217;s (and our country&#8217;s) problems, and in general <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/a/06harrispoll.htm" rel="nofollow">trust and celebrate the military far too much</a>, especially relative to other institutions.    This is what I mean by &#8220;militarism.&#8221; And I think it is militarism, not a particular addiction to torture porn, that forms the foundation of the controversy that this thread centers on.  To a great extent the &#8220;left&#8221; (heavy quotation marks there) has at least tactically bought into this militarism, which unnecessarily complicates their position in this discussion by ceding far too much ground from the outset.</p>

<p>Rich, you have nearly cartoon view of the military.  Obedience is a military virtue, but so is initiative.  There are no mind numbed robots in the services because there&#8217;s no value in that.  The ideal Private is the kid who is capable of telling when it&#8217;s time to shut up and do as ordered and when to take a different tack or even outright question the orders given.</p>

						<p>How can you disagree that there&#8217;s a banking crisis?  The Fed has taken unprecedented steps to flood the banking system with liquidity.  They&#8217;ve invented new loan facilities on the fly.  They&#8217;ve started taking lower-quality debt as collateral.  They&#8217;ve started lending to non-banking financial institutions.  They basically underwrote JP Morgan&#8217;s takeover of Bear Stearns.  The Fed certainly thinks there&#8217;s a banking crisis.</p>

<p>I claim otherwise.  Military leadership suits you for authoritarian politics, not for leadership in a democratic country.  Military leaders who went on to become successful politicians, like Eisenhower, mostly had top-level military jobs that were essentially political.</p>
<p>And the sense in which you call on initiative as a military value doesn&#8217;t affect my criticism at all.  Initiative in what? &#8212; killing and torturing.  It&#8217;s the essence of authoritarian thought to not merely turn people into robots, but to make the goals to which they turn even their initiative essentially unquestioned and destructive.</p>

						<p><em>But, there is plenty in military service that is absolutely analogous, simply smaller scale, experience. And it’s be silly to claim otherwise.</em></p>
<p>RTO, experience in <em>what</em>?  Management?  Marshaling of resources?  In that case, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay" rel="nofollow">Gordon Ramsay</a> would make an excellent President, as would most successful kitchen managers.  (This even covers pushmedia&#8217;s <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/reverse-torture-porn/#comment-13472" rel="nofollow">first comment</a>, inasmuch as people respect head chefs who started on the line more than those with CIA training.)</p>
<p><em>Military leaders who went on to become successful politicians, like Eisenhower, mostly had top-level military jobs that were essentially political.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll buy the analogy:</p>
<p>Eisenhower : Patton :: President : Congress</p>
<p><em>But as this thread suggests, what is driving the controversy over Clark’s comments are larger ideas about military service not ideas about torture. And as the very carefully couched discussion in this thread suggests, the “left” today has a very difficult time constructing a coherent critique of the military and of militarism in general.</em></p>
<p>But as silbey notes, it&#8217;s not the military that&#8217;s at issue here &#8212; it&#8217;s the heroism of McCain the POW, the fortitude required to withstand years of torture.  I&#8217;ll grant him that &#8212; <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/knowing-the-rest-of-the-story-is-half-the-battle/" rel="nofollow">more, even</a> &#8212; but it isn&#8217;t a quality I require in a President.  As Vance noted, 99 percent of the job is policy, making heroism a largely symbolic quality.  And it&#8217;s not like <em>actual</em> heroism is required: as Reagan proved, having <em>played</em> a hero is sufficient proof that&#8217;d you be one if the need ever arose.</p>

						<p><em>Whaaaat?</em></p>
<p>If learning how to wrangle Patton isn&#8217;t a crash course in politics, I don&#8217;t know what is.  (I was just stepping away from the &#8220;command experience&#8221; angle and toward a &#8220;dealing with strong-willed unruly people&#8221; one.)</p>
<p><em>No. The part that GEN Clark wants to focus on is NOT his command experience but his heroism as a POW. And therin lies the offense; offering short shrift to what is pertinent.</em></p>
<p>RTO, that&#8217;s just factually wrong.  To quote from a <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/pub/?p=1015" rel="nofollow">source you trust</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>CLARK: Because in the matters of national security policy making, it’s a matter of understanding risk. It’s a matter of gauging your opponents and it’s a matter of being held accountable.</p>
<p>John McCain’s never done any of that in his official positions. I certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war. He was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces, as a prisoner of war. He has been a voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And he has traveled all over the world.</p>
<p>But he hasn’t held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded — that wasn’t a wartime squadron. He hasn’t been there and ordered the bombs to fall. He hasn’t seen what it’s like when diplomats come in and say, I don’t know whether we’re going to be able to get this point through or not. Do you want to take the risk? What about your reputation? How do we handle this publicly? He hasn’t made that calls, Bob.</p>
<p>SCHIEFFER: Well, General, maybe — could I just interrupt you?</p>
<p>CLARK: Sure.</p>
<p>SCHIEFFER: I have to say, Barack Obama has not had any of those experiences, either, nor has he ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down. I mean…</p>
<p>CLARK: Well, I don’t think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clark is focusing on his command experience until Schieffer <em>interrupts</em> him.  I&#8217;ve heard tell of a wink wink relation between interviewer and interviewee, but remember, Schieffer&#8217;s one of the few people <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060319-1.html" rel="nofollow">Dick Cheney</a> allows himself to be interviewed by, so I&#8217;m not buying the invidious liberal media argument.</p>

						<p>No doubt I missed the complex reality in which the U.S. military also has the primary goals of painting schools and petting fluffy bunnies.</p>
<p>Look, these threads really aren&#8217;t productive.  Abu Ghraib happened; it&#8217;s known.  The people who want to preserve the myth of the U.S. military being an honorable institution will of course try to preserve that myth, but the terrorists that they&#8217;ve created worldwide know better, and those are the people who  we really are going to have to deal with.  Let the people who still want to believe that they somehow did good with their lives believe whatever they have to, and get on with dealing with reality.</p>

						<p>SEK&#8217;s challenge remains open. We&#8217;ve seen a few supporters mention McCain&#8217;s other naval responsibilities, a few people criticize Obama, some contend that Clark has no right to judge, and finally, there is a contingent that says no one says that a plane crash and POW time are qualifications for president. But no one in this long string of comments has demonstrated why Clark&#8217;s conclusion is incorrect. It looks like crashing a plane and being a POW is not a material qulification to be president. So, like <a href="http://books.google.com/books? id=7wJIPJ80RdUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=Arthur+Jaffe+math+challenge&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3EzApbOgkH&amp;sig=_FA5C2I4QdZpX5L8yn1-CnRV90Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1" rel="nofollow">  Arthur Jaffe&#8217;s millenium challenge, </a> the prize will remain uncollected.</p>

						<p>SEK:  GEN Clark mentions the command experience because Schieffer had already brought it up at the top of the interview (before the portion quoted).  And Clark is dismissive of it:  That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded — that wasn’t a wartime squadron. He hasn’t been there and ordered the bombs to fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a wartime squadron&#8211;big deal. And that kind of dismissal is demeaning. And as I point out in my own article, LCDR McCain certainly did, literally, order bombs to fall and was decorated for doing it well.  But the General elides (demeans) that hoping his audience doesn&#8217;t know better (thereby demeaning his audience as well, I might add).</p>
<p>No way to know in retrospect but even the command experience might have been avoided by the General as a topic altogether had it not been for Schieffer.</p>

<p>The best part of that post is that it evolved into a completely irrelevant baseball conversation.

						<p>I&#8217;ve asked this question before, so forgive me for repeating myself:  When was the last time anyone here had a serious political argument, with someone who genuinely espoused views radically different from you own, that was productive (use Rich&#8217;s definition, for lack of something more precise)?  Which is to say, I&#8217;m not using the high bar:  an argument in which one side or the other convinced their opponent to abandon a dearly held point of view.  </p>
<p>I guess my point is this:  arguing politics can be really fun.  And it&#8217;s a great way to blow off steam.  But productive it usually isn&#8217;t.</p>

						<p>Back to SEKs original pont and challenge:</p>
<p>Executive Qualities displayed by LCRD McCain during bombing missions and as a POW:</p>
<p>Loyalty&#8211;Refused parole unless all those who were captured before him were also released.<br />
Duty&#8211;After the Forrestal fire, LT McCain observed that having seen what their bombs did close up, maybe he wasn&#8217;t so thrilled by the idea of dropping them anymore&#8211;but he continued in his duty anyway.  It was a scant three months between being injured in that fire and being decorated for performance over North Vietnam.<br />
Respect&#8211;Each day, LCDR McCain would recite in his mind the names and statuses of all the other prisoners in Hoa Loa that he had learned of, so that in the even of his repatriation he could pass that information on.<br />
Selfless-Service&#8211;Refusing parole, not informing the North Vietnamese of his family connection.<br />
Honor&#8211;After the Forrestal fire, LT McCain told a reporter, &#8220;We&#8217;re preofessional military men and I suppose it&#8217;s our war, and yet here were enlsited men who earn $150 a month and work 18 to 20 hours a day&#8211;and I mean manual labor&#8211;and certaily would have survived had they not stayed to help the pilots fight the fire&#8230;.  I&#8217;ve never seen such acts of heroism.&#8221;<br />
Integrity&#8211;While a prisoner of the North Vietnamese and subjected to torture and privation, he succumbed to pressure to write out and sign a &#8220;confession.&#8221;  Ever since he has never tried to justify or minimize that it was wrong and that is was a personal failure on his part.<br />
Courage&#8211;The citation given for the day that he was shot down states that despite the plane being damaged beyond recovery, LCRD McCain still completed his mission delivering his bombs on target.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t think anyone would, but RTOT&#8217;s come closest.  To wit: Clark misrepresented McCain&#8217;s command experience, which, when we consider in its totality, is a quality we look for in a President.  </p>
<p>This, at least, makes the stakes clear, in that the next question is &#8220;Do we want the country run like the military?&#8221;  Or, to point more starkly: &#8220;Do we think the grunts should <em>elect</em> their superior officer?&#8221;  The answer, clearly, is &#8220;No, with thunder.&#8221;  But now we&#8217;re at least arguing about <em>something</em>, as opposed to casting aspersions about an undefined nothing, <em>i.e.</em> the whatever it is McCain possesses but Obama doesn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>Put another way: now we can talk about McCain&#8217;s military record without people shouting us down as unpatriotic or anti-military, because we&#8217;ve identified, clearly, that the question isn&#8217;t about his command experience <em>per se</em>, but it&#8217;s relevance to arguments about who would make the better President.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had arguments with anarchists that were productive in that sense.  (I&#8217;m a left-liberal.)  Further back, there were some Burkean conservatives who occasionally had some good points.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s face reality here.  Current movement conservatism doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with ideas.  Right-wingers are merely evil and / or stupid.  There are going to be Bush dead-enders going on in comment threads from now till they die off, and there&#8217;s nothing to be gained by having them rehearse their mumbling, morally bankrupt self-justifications for the bad things they&#8217;ve done and would still like to do.</p>
<p>And really, anyone can see that McCain is a coward.  It&#8217;s implicit in all of his political acts.</p>

						<p>Yeah, SEK ,this site and a couple of others do help me reorganize my thoughts. I do change what&#8217;s left of my mind from these conversations.</p>
<p>And it only took 140 some comments to get to his best shot.   R-TOT&#8217;s list of attributes of McCain do not in any way dispute Clark&#8217;s statement that being a prisoner or being shot down are not qualifications for the president. Close, but no prize R-TOT. Prize is still up for grabs.</p>
<p>I love this site and I am too unschooled to participate in a substantive way in most discussions, but I do love to play, so forgive me for this:  Please refer to Teddy Ballgame&#8217;s potential nomination. He was a pilot in 2 wars, completed all his missions (including last one by returning keys to the Marine Corps) and has spent the last 4 years in a box with no food. I say he has what it takes to be president. Do you dare to disagree?</p>

						<p>drip,</p>
<p>By old, I mean I am two years older than Obama, but I always feel like that makes me 132 in internet years.  </p>
<p>I think Teddy Ballgame&#8217;s manner vis a vis the press would have been a deeply amusing asset in the presidency.  </p>
<p>Last shot at this &#8212; the qualities that McCain exhibited as a pilot may well be to his credit in terms of leadership, tenacity, self-scarifice, etc.  &#8212; what we have argued and I believe Clark posited is that these are not qualities that necessarily speak to an aptitude for foreign policy.  I would argue that dropping bombs on people as a solution to foreign policy problems and to be predisposed to do so &#8212; to think it is riotous to sing &#8220;bomb, bomb, bomb Iran&#8221; &#8212; suggests that it may well not be a plus in this arena.</p>

						<p>Not my fault drip, the premise and challenge is wobbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I challenge anyone currently being critical of Wesley Clark to disprove his point on its face.  I don’t want to hear anything about Clark’s own military record or Barack Obama’s lack of one.*  I want you to list the specific executive qualities cultivated by twenty-three bombing missions and five years in a POW camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m asked to disprove a statement, that as stated and removed form the larger conversation it came from is true; riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is not a qualification to be president.  But then I&#8217;m asked for a list of qualities, cultivated by not only captivity but also by participating in military missions, that ARE qualifications for President.</p>
<p>Even were the bald assertion&#8211;riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is not a qualification to be president&#8211;blatantly false on it&#8217;s face, the former list cannot ever constitute disproof, or proof for that matter, of the latter assertion&#8217;s veracity.</p>
<p>A complaint went out that I had not offered the list and I&#8217;ve conceded on the assertion offering my particular complaints regarding where the offense actually lies.</p>

						<p>Sorry R-TOT, no dice. Some of what you listed were qualities you attribute to McCain which you contend were evidenced during his last bombing run and subsequent captivity, but these were not <i> executive qualities cultivated by twenty-three bombing missions and five years in a POW camp </i>. As to your conclusions, his poor performance at the Naval Academy, his disloyalty to his wives, his behavior in the S&amp;L matter and his continued reliance on lobbyists, argue against the characteristics you infer from his behavior during captivity, so I&#8217;m not even sure that his public record supports the characterization you offer.</p>
<p>As to McCain&#8217;s wish to bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran, well, I don&#8217;t want to change the debate, but it strikes me as a bad idea and a bad joke, but perhaps I should forgive him the bad joke, having compared him unfavorably to a frozen baseball player.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll submit the possibility that it&#8217;s not the perception that renders the conversations unproductive, but the reality. If all those arguing for a position are either evil or stupid, it would be hard to make headway with them.</p>

						<p>R-TOT is a friendly, familiar handle, R-TOT, like T-Mac, A-Rod and P-Diddy. I&#8217;ll stop, if its upsetting. As for my poor typing and attempts to restate question to keep myself alert, forgive me.</p>
<p>BTW, the debate hasn&#8217;t changed. Please to provide answer to challenge restated below for your convenience:</p>
<p><i>I challenge anyone currently being critical of Wesley Clark to disprove his point on its face. I don’t want to hear anything about Clark’s own military record or Barack Obama’s lack of one.* I want you to list the specific executive qualities cultivated by twenty-three bombing missions and five years in a POW camp.</i></p>
<p>Open book, take all the time you need. Since you&#8217;re trying, and turned your paper in early, I would note that you have yet to show how the twenty-three missions and subsequent captivity *cultivated* executive qualities, but you seem a nice lad, if a little sensitive, so I&#8217;ll give you an A for effort, but you still have to answer the question.</p>

						<p>Just to clarify:  I wasn&#8217;t saying that political conversations aren&#8217;t worthwhile, just that they&#8217;re not usually productive &#8212; based on the definition used above.  But I do enjoy them, as I noted, and I do think they&#8217;re a great way to put words to pixels.  I just haven&#8217;t had, for some time, the experience that SEK or drip describe.  </p>
<p>Well, maybe that&#8217;s not true.  The W years have pushed me much further to the left, and I&#8217;ve found myself nodding my head when in arguments with people who I used to consider quite radical.  A long time ago &#8212; if anyone cared, I&#8217;d find a link &#8212; I noted on this blog that one of the things that most annoys me about President Bush is the fact that I now share opinions with conspiracy theorists.</p>

						<p>Actually ari, I have some pretty intense conspiracy theories rattling around in my skull.  Right now though, I&#8217;m concentrating my efforts on nominating a cryovaked (sp?) half-mexican for president. No one on this site takes me seriously and its this sort of idiocy that allows me to learn stuff; that and an open mind.</p>

						<p>RTO Trainer, of course you don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;re evil or stupid.  But, of course, you could be wrong.  The fact that you say that you&#8217;re dangerously close to holding positions characteristic of neo-militia members during the 90&#8217;s is good evidence that you&#8217;re wrong.  </p>
<p>So the next question is, why?  Denial, probably.  Anyone who could look at the Bush years and then vote for McCain is probably caught in something like the following: a) there are certain things I&#8217;ve believed in and acted on all my life, b) I&#8217;ve seen them lead to great evil, c) if I acknowledge that, I&#8217;d have to change how I behave, or at least take a hit in my self-image.  Maybe not boast about how I served in Kabul, for instance, not after I acknowledged what a piss-poor job the U.S. Army has done there.  Maybe not have a screen name that ties your identity to a promoter of evil.  </p>
<p>But to break with one&#8217;s past self in that way takes courage.  And if there&#8217;s one thing the right doesn&#8217;t have, it&#8217;s courage.  First they wanted everyone to hide under their beds after 9/11.  Then they insisted that we had to torture people because otherwise we&#8217;d be at greater risk.  Islamofascism, Mexican hordes, gay people, it&#8217;s just one fear after another.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;ve never been fond of essentialist arguments, so the idea that someone <i>is</i> evil and/or stupid seems a bit pointless to me. But If I were to grant the possibility that people could necessarily <i>be</i> either evil or stupid, I&#8217;d have to imagine that those who are evil wouldn&#8217;t percieve themselves as evil. Same with the stupid. In fact, the stupid would have a doubly-difficult time percieving themselves as stupid, because stupid is their default position plus stupid people have trouble processing reality.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m confused. I think I&#8217;m stupid.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;d just like to associate myself with Ben Alpers&#8217; <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/reverse-torture-porn/#comment-13595" rel="nofollow">comment</a>.</p>
<p>I disagree, however, in that I think he and SEK are identifying problems that run in parallel; it&#8217;s not either/or, it&#8217;s both/and.  Militarism <b>and</b> a fondness for torture porn.</p>
<p>I also have to say I agree completely with Rich on this:</p>
<p><i>And if there’s one thing the right doesn’t have, it’s courage.</i></p>
<p>Contemporary American conservatism is, at its core, a fear-driven ideology.</p>
<p>This is why Obama&#8217;s recent tack has so disappointed me.  He&#8217;s buying into and thereby promoting the right&#8217;s fear, rather than offering the strong, courageous ideas liberalism offers.  Some of these, as I&#8217;ve stated them elsewhere, are: that we don’t sell out America’s core principles just because some nuts blew up a couple of buildings; that we’re much too big and much too strong for that; that we will continue to be America, and such nuts just flat aren’t big enough or strong enough to make us stop.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the response of a strong country to events like 9/11.  What we&#8217;ve gotten instead from the Bush administration, the right, many on the supposed left, and to an increasing extent from Obama, is the response of a weak country, terrified of getting its nose bloodied.</p>
