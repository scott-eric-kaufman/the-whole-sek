		<p>Having <a href="http://itself.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/the-great-criminal/">failed</a> in my attempt to compel Adam to discuss <em>The Dark Knight</em> in terms of Schmitt, Benjamin, or Agamben &#8212; the perpetual state of emergency and what-not &#8212; I was content to let the matter drop.  But as a future professor of literature somewhere, preferably in the near future, I can&#8217;t let the <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/oh-for-heavens-sake/">conservative push to lionize Bush-as-Batman</a> or the <a href="http://theunapologeticmexican.org/elmachete/2008/07/22/the-dark-knight-on-terror/">liberal push to demonize Batman-as-Bush</a> stand.  Both interpretations are naive inasmuch as they mistake the depiction of an issue for an endorsement of it.</p>
<p>The conversations on <em>Unfogged</em> about the impossibility of an anti-war film always annoyed me because they either 1) knighted those most likely to misunderstand the most basic literary devices &#8212; like irony &#8212; the final arbiters of meaning; or 2) devolved into polite-but-pointed accusations about who <em>really</em> loves watching people-bits scatter across the sky.  In professional-literary-type terms, the conversations flat-lined somewhere between Fishian reader-response and crude Freudian insinuation.  Needless to say, neither of these modes produces much in the way of value.</p>
<p>To return to <em>The Dark Knight</em>: although not immediately evident, the film is profoundly critical of the current administration and its policies.  Its utilitarian compromises &#8212; the surveillance system, Batman in the box with the Joker &#8212; are criticized by sound moral agents <em>as they occur</em>: Lucius threatens to quit, Gordon breaks for the door.  The problem, in both instances, is that neither Lucius nor Gordon has the authority or muscle to stop Batman.  Their attempt to stop Batman from compromising his moral authority fails; and their failure leads directly to Batman&#8217;s debasement at film&#8217;s end.  But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself here.</p>
<p>(<em><strong>Way</strong> ahead of myself, as I meant to note that one of the reasons I&#8217;ve written so much about <strong>The Dark Knight</strong> isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m a fanboy &#8212; although I am &#8212; but because it&#8217;s a such a rare horse: a film as substantial as it is popular and can be discussed with an audience unaccustomed to literary analysis.  It&#8217;s as if the world itself has done the reading.</em>)</p>
<p><span id="more-1842"></span></p>
<p>In <em>Batman Begins</em>, the formative event in Bruce Wayne&#8217;s life is the murder of his unambiguously good parents.  To young Wayne, their commonplace death &#8212; nothing atypical about urban violence in impoverished cities &#8212; represents a radical wrong in the moral order of his universe.  The depth of his belief in its wrongness is evident in the lengths he goes to combat it: the years of training, thieving, imprisonment, &amp;c.  It was all for naught.  As Ra&#8217;s al Ghul said, when a city is so corrupt criminal organizations can infiltrate its highest offices, only a purging fire can set matters right.  Nothing more unusual here than the standard revolution-as-social-reform, proceduralism-won&#8217;t-work line.  Given the dystopia that is Gotham in the first film, Ra&#8217;s al Ghul is certainly right.</p>
<p>Wayne&#8217;s solution is quasi-proceduralist, inasmuch as he introduces a radical element <em>within the extant social structure</em> in order to provide Gordon, Dent, and Dawes time and space enough to prosecute via conventional means.  (One of them, or possibly Batman, says as much in <em>The Dark Knight</em>.)  Critical attention focuses on the opening bank heist and Ledger&#8217;s Joker &#8212; with good reason &#8212; but the Joker&#8217;s rise obscures the results Gordon and Batman have achieved since the conclusion of <em>Batman Begins</em>.</p>
<p>The first film closes with the Falcone mob shattered and an outsider, Ra&#8217;s al Ghul, defeated; but the other mob bosses and the ordinary violent felons still rule the streets.  By the time <em>The Dark Knight</em> opens, Batman and Gordon have scrubbed Gotham shiny.  I mean that literally: the exterior shots of Gotham reinforce the impression that the city is cleaner, possessed of an atmosphere light can penetrate.  With Dent&#8217;s rise and a crippled mob, Wayne can said to have accomplished his original goal: create an environment in which proceduralism can adequately respond to elements aligning against the body social.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the way most critics have viewed the film.  The fashionably against-the-grain reading pairs Dent and the Joker as the film&#8217;s moral foils, but I insist on interpreting the film counter-counter-intuitively, with Dent a rough equivalent of Wayne&#8217;s father, <em>i.e.</em> a supremely benevolent personality of a sort that can only exist in a functioning society.  Without Batman and Gordon&#8217;s efforts, Dent would&#8217;ve been so much piss in the wind.  The Joker, however, is the unique product of a society whose stability is guaranteed by a man in a giant bat-suit.  He is not, as <a href="http://theunapologeticmexican.org/elmachete/2008/07/22/the-dark-knight-on-terror/">Nezua would have it</a>, a stand-in for terrorism <em>writ large</em> so much as a figure for the Malkin-esque fear that the bell that calls for prayer tolls for her: irate mullahs, public fatwas, endless caliphate, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Joker isn&#8217;t a stand-in for terrorists, then, but what clenched conservatives assume terrorists to be &#8212; without plan, without complaint, without decency, without humanity &#8212; so to the &#8220;if you, like me, like Yoo&#8221; crowd, Batman&#8217;s response is eminently reasonable.  Except, of course, it isn&#8217;t: on the one hand, Lucius and Gordon object; on the other, the Joker doesn&#8217;t simply want to see Gotham burn, he wants to know the identity of the man he believes to be his photo-negative.  When he discovers it as Batman tortures him, his motives shift: now he wants to destroy not <em>Wayne</em>, not Batman, as it&#8217;s Wayne&#8217;s support of Dent that threatens to snuff Batman.  There is a <em>there</em> there more substantial than the unadulterated nihilism.</p>
<p>His rage may be inscrutable, but it&#8217;s not baseless: he can tailor his formative myth to fit the fears of his victim because, it seems, he&#8217;s not invested in it.  Both versions presented in the film involve a private, family trauma &#8212; were I psychoanalytically inclined, I&#8217;d say this means the truth either 1) involves a private, family trauma or 2) doesn&#8217;t involve a private, family trauma, <em>i.e.</em> he either picks at old scars or points in irrelevant directions.  The truth is less important here than the compulsion it creates: unlike common criminals and mid-level mob lackeys, the Joker won&#8217;t scare and won&#8217;t quit.</p>
<p>The tension at the core of Frank Miller&#8217;s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> evinces itself here: only so long as Wayne is in peak physical condition will he be able to stabilize the social order.  This stabilization is, to Wayne&#8217;s mind, a temporary fix to an structural problem whose solution is not, as we learn in both the graphic novel and early the second film, Batman-impersonators.  In the graphic novel, Wayne unites his impersonator and leads an army of sycophants <em>who paint their faces white and smear Batman&#8217;s symbol around their eyes</em>.  Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Miller&#8217;s Batman can rally an army comprised of people who, like the Joker, are a direct result of his actions, <em>i.e.</em> neither future Batman&#8217;s army nor the Joker can self-fashion.  Billionaire playboy-<em>cum</em>-caped vigilante Bruce Wayne believes himself to be self-fashioned &#8212; What <em>is</em> the use of all those push-ups if he can&#8217;t even lift a bloody log? &#8212; but he is as much a creation of extraordinary circumstance as the Joker.  Had he not been a billionaire scion; had he not fallen into a well as a child; had the well not been full of bats; had the feature not had bats; had his parents not been killed; had he shot Chill; had he not run away; &amp;c.  He incorporates the circumstances responsible for his transformation into Batman into his self-fashioned self, but in the same way Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia.  He is his own perpetually revised narrative of self.  These revisions don&#8217;t trouble the viewer, as he or she is familiar with them.  Were the roles reversed &#8212; were this a Joker franchise, focused on the particulars of his descent into arch-criminality &#8212; and a man in a bat-suit hounded the Joker&#8217;s every move, Batman would be equally inscrutable.  All of which is a tedious, roundabout way of stating the obvious: just because we&#8217;re not told what&#8217;s there doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s nothing there.</p>
<p>This post became unwieldy nine graphs back, so let me cut to the chase: Dent&#8217;s mental collapse shocks Wayne because he borrowed the faith he invested in Dent from his father&#8217;s stock, such that he sees what might have become had his mother died alone that night.  In short, in Dent he sees the potential for rot everywhere, in everything, even his father&#8217;s cartoonishly unambiguous good.  The Joker doesn&#8217;t factor into this equation.  He is an agent of chaos in the diminutive sense: a <em>mere</em> agent, an irrational actor in an agency grown so large his actions exist beneath its perceptual threshold.</p>
<p>The people of Gotham would, of course, disagree, since the Joker&#8217;s the only visible foil &#8212; but this is only because Batman and Gordon decide to suppress Dent&#8217;s descent into Two-Face.  Better the city believe in the machinery of conventional politics and condemn Batman for acting outside it than for them to believe even its shiniest cogs are corruptible.  While Nolan criticizes the current administration&#8217;s commitment to total surveillance <em>ad infinitem</em> by limiting its purview to the current state of emergency, he does seem to embrace the neoconservative rationale of lying to the public for their own benefit.  The public doesn&#8217;t know what it would mean to create a stable, pro-American democracy in the Middle East, and if the only way to do so is talk about uranium enrichment or al Qaeda connections, so be it &#8212; they&#8217;ll thank us in the end.</p>
<p><em>Only we don&#8217;t</em>.  Not in the film, at least.  The final two minutes of the film are unsettling <em>because</em>, not <em>in spite of</em> our knowledge of the stakes.  We know the consequences of these lies, and as Batman wheels off into the night, we can already imagine what&#8217;ll happen when Wayne somehow discovers the contents of the letter Alfred burned from Dawes; when the public discovers the new criminal mastermind, Two-Face, was once Harvey Dent; &amp;c.  Nolan prepares us for the private and public backlash against those who head-fake us because <em>they care</em>.</p>

						<p>Heh. Well, what us &#8220;naïve&#8221; &#8220;left and right&#8221; minded people commenting on the film do seem to agree on is that, well, this:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Nolan] does seem to embrace the neoconservative rationale of lying to the public for their own benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so on. It&#8217;s not just that neocon view, it&#8217;s a few of them. Which are pretty clearly outlined.</p>
<p>Now, you take a much broader view, factoring in multiple installments or prequels of this current narrative, the original story. And you make some great observations. I was discussing the film (and again, rather superficially as I had only seen it one time and in a theater) as a self-contained piece. I can tell your training, as much good as it has done your ability to analyze in general, is not in film critique. Is it? Cuz normally, we don&#8217;t assume things we do not see on screen. Such as what you &#8220;imagine&#8221; will happen after the black falls on the last scene. </p>
<p>Anyway, I love some of what you are saying. And it&#8217;s good, smart stuff. For example</p>
<blockquote><p>The Joker isn’t a stand-in for terrorists, then, but what clenched conservatives assume terrorists to be — without plan, without complaint, without decency, without humanity — so to the “if you, like me, like Yoo” crowd, Batman’s response is eminently reasonable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree (as I said to the last commenter at my site on this) that this movie doesn&#8217;t accurately use the Joker as what terrorism actually is. But yes, it does present it in such a way, a cartoonish way, that falls in line with the cartoonish frames the public is fed normally.</p>
<blockquote><p> Except, of course, it isn’t: on the one hand, Lucius and Gordon object; on the other, the Joker doesn’t simply want to see Gotham burn, he wants to know the identity of the man he believes to be his photo-negative. </p></blockquote>
<p>Why? Because he wants to know him? No. Because he wants to <em>burn him down</em>. Burn down the good. Burn down the deeds, and the public trust. So I do think we have to take the writers&#8217; word on this&#8230;the Joker is described and shown to be someone who &#8220;just wants to see the world burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I agree. It is a very well-made and enjoyable piece with some delicious layers. Thanks for writing this piece and linking. It&#8217;s very thought-provoking.</p>

						<p>This was awesome. I ridiculously enjoyed this.</p>
<p>Almost as an aside, you seem to say that Joker knew that Wayne was Batman? I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s possible. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be common knowledge that Wayne has a special relationship with Rachel. I took it to mean that Joker just knew that he liked Rachel. I need to watch it a second time (this time in IMAX). So maybe I missed it though..</p>

						<p><em>As for this Schmidt person, I’m not familiar.</em> </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be bothered to check such piddly winks when the internet gushes like a leaky faucet.  But yes, consider it corrected.</p>
<p><em>I was so hoping the title referred to John, not Bruce.</em></p>
<p>In McCain&#8217;s dreams.</p>
<p>No, seriously, <em>in his dreams.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, what us “naïve” “left and right” minded people commenting on the film do seem to agree on is that, well, this</em></p>
<p>Sorry for the harshness.  I aimed for &#8220;self-deprecating marmish chastisement,&#8221; but missed.</p>
<p><em>Such as what you “imagine” will happen after the black falls on the last scene. </em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken/taught some film studies classes, but yes, my training&#8217;s in literature.  That said, the intense focus on the acts of deception as the film closed point to <b>CONSEQUENCES</b> in the sequel.  In truth, <em>The Dark Knight</em> is likely to be the strongest film in the series, as the third one&#8217;ll involve Ewoks.  That said, the shots of lying-in-action coupled with Gordon&#8217;s closing soliloquy lead me to believe we&#8217;re being prepped, and so long as the speculation is grounded in the film&#8217;s larger &#8212; in this case, maybe largest &#8212; themes, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being too irresponsible.  (I&#8217;m not, for example, performing arcane rites on frame 29,921 to determine whether E. Nigma&#8217;s name was on Wayne&#8217;s iPhone or somesuch.)</p>
<p><em>Because he wants to burn him down.</em></p>
<p>I started replying with a point about how the Joker wants Batman, a single person, to burn, whereas the 9/11 hijackers wanted to destroy a symbol, but then I realized how stupid I sounded and wrote this instead.  Let me think about this one a bit more.</p>

						<p><em>Almost as an aside, you seem to say that Joker knew that Wayne was Batman?</em></p>
<p>I need to see it again too, as I &#8220;won&#8221; the IMAX lottery and saw it 9:15 a.m. the Friday of its release.  That said, it&#8217;s the scene in the box &#8212; Can you tell I watched <em>Homicide</em>? &#8212; when the Joker talks about the way he looked at Dawes at the party, at which point Batman violates the Geneva convention.  It was clear, I thought, in context, but my wife and <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080716/REVIEWS/55996637" rel="nofollow">Roger Ebert</a> missed it to, so you might be right: he might&#8217;ve made the Batman-likes-Dawes connection independent of Wayne.</p>

						<p>I have not yet seen <i>Dark Knight</i>, so am ignoring this thread, but fwiw, we *did* see <i>Hancock</i> tonight, with PK, and it&#8217;s a surprisingly good movie!  Fun, li&#8217;l bit of a social conscience in there, interracial romance in which the interracial part is *completely* unremarked, and for extra bonus awesomeness, a woman with two husbands.  That &#8220;problem&#8221; is sorta kinda solved, well enough for yer average movie-goer, but for those of us who attend to these things?  It&#8217;s actually not solved at all.  </p>
<p>Which is so awesome.</p>
<p>(PK felt that it was &#8220;too sexual,&#8221; aka romantic, for him.  Violence?  AWESOME.  Kissing and feelings?  EWWWW.)</p>

						<p>Perhaps WSW too is a party to the Batman/Bush crowd:</p>
<p>&#8220;What worldview does this correspond to or suggest? It brings to mind the recent article in the New York Times, following the release of minutes from a meeting among military torturers and their accomplices at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The Times piece referred to the “confusion” among those in attendance “about both the legal limits and the effectiveness of interrogation methods.”</p>
<p>This is not to say that the Nolans consciously share the wretched latter-day liberalism of the Times or its British equivalents. But it points to the consequences of not thinking seriously about things, a failure that permits the artist to be picked up by or used by stronger currents in the absence of knowledge and principled opposition.&#8221;</p>

						<p><em>surely he [the Joker] would have shared the revelation, no?</em><br />
<em>And flipped another truck!</em></p>
<p>Batman flipped the truck.</p>
<p><em>now he wants to destroy not Wayne, not Batman</em></p>
<p>One too many &#8220;not&#8221;s there, I think, otherwise the emphasis doesn&#8217;t make sense.  Anyway, you don&#8217;t need to assume that the Joker wants to get Wayne out of the way to keep Batman going because Wayne&#8217; support of Dent &amp;c, and that he comes to this conclusion when he learns that &#8220;Wayne&#8221; and &#8220;Hesperus&#8221; corefer, if all you want is to conclude that there&#8217;s a there there from the fact that he wants to keep Batman going. The Joker says <em>that</em> as much outright, more than once.</p>
<p><em>he is as much a creation of extraordinary circumstance as the Joker. Had he not been a billionaire scion; had he not fallen into a well as a child; had the well not been full of bats; had the feature not had bats; had his parents not been killed; had he shot Chill; had he not run away; &amp;c. He incorporates the circumstances responsible for his transformation into Batman into his self-fashioned self, but in the same way Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia. He is his own perpetually revised narrative of self.</em></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t really <em>know</em> what created the Joker, though.  Saying the Joker was created by the situation prevailing in Gotham is a lot different from saying that Batman was created by the conditions you identify in the excerpt <em>supra</em>.  And I really don&#8217;t know what you mean by the Oceania/Eurasia point (many might say that the claim about perpetually revised narratives goes for the majority of normal people, and I don&#8217;t see why the Batman impersonators aren&#8217;t self-fashioners, but we&#8217;ll let that slide). If Batman suffers from anything regarding his past, it&#8217;s the sort of bad faith that perceives the past as immutable and impossible to transcend, and sticks a never to be revised narrative thereon.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why we should think that anything like what happened with Wayne (ie, some more or less understandable events in his past combine in such and such a more or less understandable way to give him his present psychological shape) happened with the Joker, and thus I don&#8217;t see why we should think it&#8217;s just the focus of the series that makes the Joker inscrutable and Batman not, with the thing potentially being reversible.  Yeah, right, we aren&#8217;t told what&#8217;s there, but it would remove a lot of interest from the Joker if he even <em>had</em> a backstory of which we aren&#8217;t aware of that sort.  (And you moved awful fast from &#8220;just because we don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s there, we can&#8217;t conclude it&#8217;s not there&#8221; to &#8220;therefore it&#8217;s there&#8221;, and to assuming that whatever <em>is</em> there is related to his scars. The Joker seems like just the sort who&#8217;d take some fortuitous facial feature into account in his act, especially if he finds out it plays well.)</p>
<p><em>His rage may be inscrutable, but it’s not baseless: he can tailor his formative myth to fit the fears of his victim because, it seems, he’s not invested in it.</em></p>
<p>Say more about how the scar-story fits the fears of his victim (aside from the fear that, holy shit, this freak is about to cut my mouth open). What does Dawes fear, that makes the story he tells her so apt? Would a different nubile woman have gotten a different story? And how does his lack of investment in &#8220;his formative myth&#8221; (the two versions we get are, aside from their domesticity, pretty different) keep his rage from being baseless?  Wouldn&#8217;t giving it a base make it easier to scrute, anyway?</p>
<p><em>The Joker, however, is the unique product of a society whose stability is guaranteed by a man in a giant bat-suit. He is not, as Nezua would have it, a stand-in for terrorism writ large so much as a figure for the Malkin-esque fear that the bell that calls for prayer tolls for her: irate mullahs, public fatwas, endless caliphate, &amp;c.</em></p>
<p>The second sentence (and the claim that the Joker is a stand-in for conservative fantasies of terrorists) seems to have nothing to do with the first, but I would like to know why the unique product of a society whose stability &amp;c also happens to be what conservatives imagine terrorists to be like.  And, for that matter, what is <em>meant</em> by this claim about the Joker&#8217;s being more or less called into existence by Batman? You see it a lot, and it&#8217;s attractive from afar and all, but I&#8217;ve never seen it brought into closer view.</p>
<p><em>This post became unwieldy nine graphs back, so let me cut to the chase: Dent’s mental collapse shocks Wayne because he borrowed the faith he invested in Dent from his father’s stock, such that he sees what might have become had his mother died alone that night. In short, in Dent he sees the potential for rot everywhere, in everything, even his father’s cartoonishly unambiguous good</em></p>
<p>Of course, he had already seen Dent (for all he knew) prepared to kill a prisoner at the flip of a coin, and that&#8217;s when Dent was still the golden boy of Gotham.  Anyway, I don&#8217;t see where you&#8217;re getting this.</p>

<p>This is explained (for some value of explained) at the end of <i>Batman Begins</i>, when Gordon ponders what the next step will be for crime in Gotham.  It&#8217;s an arms race:  cops get armor, thugs get armor-piercing bullets.   Cops get a bat-masked vigiliante, and Gordon is finding murder scenes decorated with a Joker card.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to see <i>The Dark Knight</i> again to be certain, but aside from the arms-race paradigm, the Joker&#8217;s slipping into the major crime syndicate so easily seems to depend on the fact that Batman &amp; Gordon have arrested so many.</p>

						<p><em>many might say that the claim about perpetually revised narratives goes for the majority of normal people, and I don’t see why the Batman impersonators aren’t self-fashioners, but we’ll let that slide</em></p>
<p>We needn&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m a good modernist.  The difference is one of scale and scope, though: we recreate ourselves privately, for the betterment of, well, our self-images.  We don&#8217;t normally share it with the rest of the world via tabloids.  </p>
<p><em>If Batman suffers from anything regarding his past, it’s the sort of bad faith that perceives the past as immutable and impossible to transcend, and sticks a never to be revised narrative thereon.</em></p>
<p>Self-fashioning and immutable pasts aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive: he can continually reinvent himself with regard to a single moment, altering as required by the present condition, <em>i.e.</em> when he&#8217;s too old to jump off buildings, he&#8217;ll still do <em>something</em> to continue to avenge his parents.</p>
<p><em>And I really don’t know what you mean by the Oceania/Eurasia point</em></p>
<p>Just that the reinventions are back-dated, such that we&#8217;ve always been who we currently are, we&#8217;ve just expressed ourselves differently.  So, old Batman is just like young Batman, despite the delegation, because he still orbits the same primal tragedy, &amp;c.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, right, we aren’t told what’s there, but it would remove a lot of interest from the Joker if he even had a backstory of which we aren’t aware of that sort.</em></p>
<p>He does have a backstory &#8212; a few of them, actually, each considered by its writer definitive, which says more about comics as a medium and staple characters than the Joker &#8212; and we know that, no matter how much misdirection he engages in.  The question isn&#8217;t whether he has a backstory, but how he deflects attention from whatever it is.  In short, he tries a little too hard to be a cipher, and when people point vigorously in the other direction, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to see what they&#8217;re pointing away from.  (More in fiction than in life, esp. with regards to post-Freud works.)</p>
<p><em>The Joker seems like just the sort who’d take some fortuitous facial feature into account in his act, especially if he finds out it plays well.</em></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t argue with that.</p>
<p><em>And, for that matter, what is meant by this claim about the Joker’s being more or less called into existence by Batman? </em></p>
<p>Ra&#8217;s al Ghul tells Batman he &#8220;took his advice about theatricality a bit literally,&#8221; an act which compels others to do likewise.  &#8220;I&#8217;m a sadistic sad clown, so I&#8217;m the Joker.&#8221;  &#8220;My name is Edward Nigma, so I&#8217;m the Riddler.&#8221;  If Wayne takes the advice about theatrically literally, he&#8217;s turned the world into a stage and crime into a performance.</p>
<p><em>Anyway, I don’t see where you’re getting this.</em></p>
<p>The transference of faith from his father to Dent?  Well, 1) he tells Dawes as much, saying he can retire with Dent as DA, 2) he starts to behave like his father, throwing balls on instead of thugs off roofs, and 3) his willingness to retire, to stop avenging his parents&#8217; deaths, isn&#8217;t just a pragmatic decision based on the fact that he can&#8217;t take this sort of beating forever.  It&#8217;s an indication that, somehow, he&#8217;s come to peace with their death; now, it may be a coincidence that this coincides with Dent&#8217;s rise and Wayne&#8217;s decision to support him, but I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

						<p>FWIW: I just saw an interview with Bale and Nolan in which 1) Bale spoke with an American accent, and 2) the two discussed how their Batman&#8217;s modeled after Edmund Morris&#8217; <em>The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</em> and <em>Theodore Rex</em>: father as noted philanthropist, mother and wife die on same day, year spent in Dakota territory, return to NYC as flamboyant night-bike-riding, head-busting, celebrity police chief. </p>
<p>And, eventually, President.  Maybe there&#8217;s something to these presidential parallels after all?</p>

<p>Christian Bale conducts nearly every interview with an American accent partly for that reason; he doesn&#8217;t like to break character. I&#8217;ve also read speculation that Bale never truly stops acting; his entire public persona is another character for him.</p>

						<p><em>I’ve also read speculation that Bale never truly stops acting; his entire public persona is another character for him.</em></p>
<p>(<em>No spoilers, promise.</em>)</p>
<p>Which makes him his character in <em>The Prestige</em>, doesn&#8217;t it?  That means he was, for a time, always in the character of a character always in character.  (No wonder he verbally abuses people from time to time.  I would too were I so confused.)</p>
<p><em>Not in the movie.</em></p>
<p>Which is why I specified I was speaking (1) geekily, as a reader of comics, and (2) obviously, in an everyone-has-a-backstory fashion.  If you assume (2), you can at least look at what he does and doesn&#8217;t say as indications of interest, perverted though it might be.</p>
