	<div class="post-content">
		<p>Conservatives are outraged that members of the Service Employees International Union were <a href="http://www.breitbart.tv/st-louis-town-hall-turmoil-were-protesters-barred-as-union-members-entered/">allowed to attend</a> Representative Russ Carnahan&#8217;s town hall, but <a href="http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2009/08/07/photos-and-video-carnahan-event-in-st-louis/">conservatives</a> were <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/08/shock-video-dems-sneak-union-thugs-into.html">turned away</a>.  Similarly, liberals were outraged when they were denied entry to Representative Kevin Brady&#8217;s town hall, but <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6563705.html">the ninety conservative doctors whose hospital sponsored the event</a> were allowed in.  I would link to those outraged liberals, but I invented them.  While I&#8217;m sure many liberals would complain if the <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/08/town-hall-tumult.html">sponsor of an event</a> had seats reserved for its members, I can&#8217;t find them.  I can, however, find many conservatives who <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2009/08/obamas-contempt-for-the-american-people-roundup.html">know that the SEIU is sponsoring these town halls</a>, but <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/08/chicago_thug_tactics.html">still write</a> that &#8220;the [SEIU] union thugs had already been quietly ushered in through the <em>back door</em>, and had already taken seats that were <em>reserved</em> for them in the front.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are upset, first, that the <em>sponsor</em> of an event <em>reserved</em> seats for its <em>members</em>; and second, that when protesters prevented <em>members</em> of the group that <em>sponsored</em> the event from reaching the seats <em>reserved</em> for them, the group <em>sponsoring</em> the event might resort to ferrying its <em>members</em> to their <em>reserved</em> seats by an alternate route.  Even without the excessive italics, that much should be obvious&#8212;only it isn&#8217;t, and while the quality of mainstream political discourse has never been that high, rarely has it been this low.</p>
<p>My standard for quality is not based on civility so much as the that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Forensics_speech_and_debate">forensic debate</a>.  The rule to which all debaters abide is, plainly but multitudinously, &#8220;Never say anything they can use against you.&#8221;  If you lack the reflexivity required to know whether your words will return to haunt you, you will lose often and spectacularly.  That&#8217;s why, when the stakes are high, it&#8217;s best to be attacking what you believe or defending what you don&#8217;t.  Your beliefs only impair your argument, because what matters is not what you know, but what you can prove.  The last thing you want to do is hand your opponent the ammunition they need to accomplish your execution.  In the 1990s, mainstream conservativism understood this well enough: it distanced itself from the Foster dramatics and focused on an affirmative offensive, be it about a Contract with Certain Americans or marital infidelities.</p>
<p>Absurdity mattered less than strategy, because as frustrating as those absurdities were, they sat well in the stomach because we knew that they were merely strategic: the machinations of Newton Leroy Gingrich were clearly machinations, and although we could and did call the man who married his high school math teacher two days after he turned eighteen a hypocrite, we never doubted his ability to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Mnemonics">excuse our dear Aunt Sally</a>, nor did we care how exactly he pleased her, because we understood that no matter how or where he chose to do so, he knew order of her operations&#8212;uterine surgery in &#8217;78, another in &#8217;80, and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1984/11/newt-gingrich-shining-knight-post-reagan-right">four-hundred and forty dollars a month</a> to provide for an ailing woman, his two children, and a dry cleaning bill for one.  Whether or not he ever said his wife was neither &#8220;young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of a President, and besides, she has cancer,&#8221; we never doubted that he was capable of such a calculus.  He was a pure political animal, predictable, and when he spoke stupidly, he did so to inflame his enemies into breaching super-dense patches of stupid that corrupted their every communiqué: &#8220;We are approaching bluster tape,&#8221; their communications officer would relay.  &#8220;Permission to canister the light and holder the cup with scrap medicine?&#8221;  As soon as the words left our lips, we understood the nature of the con in which we had cast ourselves as marks.</p>
<p><span id="more-10602"></span></p>
<p>Strategic hypocrisy we understood, could compartmentalize, and proffer rejoinder&#8212;but the New Stupid is different.  It is an unstrategic stupid emboldened by an unselfconscious hypocrisy, meaning we face an opposition who hands us their rifles and implores us not to fire them; offers us bullets on the condition that we not load those rifles; then they take their place against the wall and proceed to taunt us.  &#8220;You may have rifles and bullets,&#8221; they shout, &#8220;but you don&#8217;t know from loading guns.  Even if you somehow managed to load the bullets we  provided into the rifles we also provided you,&#8221; they continue, &#8220;you lack  the character required to shoot them.  If you don&#8217;t believe us, we will hector you mercilessly until you acquire it, and then you will shoot us with a cold smile on your face and we will die, even though we expressly told you we didn&#8217;t want you to shoot us when we handed you the rifles and the bullets.&#8221;  Knowing how it will end, the temptation to butt them senseless as soon as we secure their rifles is almost impossible to overcome; but we must remember that we are not dealing with savvy political operatives here, nor even with the toadies who absorbed tactical hypocrisy on their bouncing knees.</p>
<p>We are dealing with a lowest common denominator that bootstrapped itself into relevance on the bent back of technological innovation.  The super-dense stupid that Gingrich once goaded us into breaching now houses the headquarters of our political opponents, from which they beam their new brand of stupid to the masses:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Service Employees International Union sponsored this meeting, but I am outraged, I say, <em>outraged</em> that the SEIU reserved seats for its member at it, because that is wrong, because this is America, and I will not stand for any seating arrangement in which money means access, unless it happens to be a baseball game, in which case I will pay outrageous sums for a seat that lets me see sweat gather, bead, and roll down the line of Derek Jeter&#8217;s jaw&#8212;because that is capitalism, capitalism is American, and America is awesome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without the faith we once placed in the operatives of zero-sum politics, such statements can&#8217;t be dismissed as self-interested calculation: they emanate from the emo core of the New Stupid, which was created by the two historically unique broadcast systems born in the 1990s.  The first of which, talk radio, came into its own with the rise of Rush Limbaugh; the second is the internet generally and blogs in particular.  Although both were around before, they had yet to acquire the political prominence they would in the wake of Lewinsky (radio) and the build-up to the Second Gulf War (the internet and blogs).  Consider this: if you were 18 years old in 1992 and a conservative, your knowledge of political discourse would amount to Limbaugh&#8217;s campaign against the Clinton administration and the defense of Bush policy he and online conservatives mounted.  You would be about the age of the average political blogger, but for the first time in your adult life <em>you are politically impotent</em>.</p>
<p>Granted, there were those two awful years (1992-1994) in which Clinton worked with a Democratic Congress, but that was almost two decades ago and is but a distant memory.  For the past seventeen years, conservatives have framed every issue however they pleased; moreover, for the past nine years they have dominated the narrative so thoroughly that liberals were forced to oppose preemptive invasions, insist that American soldiers would not be greeted as liberators, and denounce those who willfully lied before, during and now in the dénouement of a suspect war in which no American soldier was greeted as a liberator.  Those conservatives who came of age during this period have never been out of power&#8212;and those who came of age earlier have forgotten how it stung&#8212;and try as they might to harness the fear this doggedly centrist regime instills in them, all they can muster is a stampeding panic.  They are like cattle on the open range who, having heard horror stories about wolves their entire lives, trample themselves silly at the sight of <a href="https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/puppy.jpg">this dread beast</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, by &#8220;trample&#8221; I mean &#8220;soldier on,&#8221; which is exactly what the right-wing radio that sustained them through the 1990s and the conservative blogs by which they cudgeled the narrative into shape in the 2000s are doing.  But absent the men in powerful places required to authorize their specious interpretations of suspect facts, their conversations increasingly resemble idle gossip in a endless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">game of telephone</a> amplified over the airwaves and through a series of tubes: before leaving for work, a conservative communicates his displeasure about some milksop Obama initiative to his neighbor;  when he returns home, his wife informs him that the gay Kenyan in the White House wants to kill grandma.  Exactly how his complaint was corrupted&#8212;from Rush to some blog, some blog to Fox, Fox to Rush, Rush to Hannity, Hannity to some blog&#8212;is less important than the inevitability that it would be.</p>
<p>These conservatives in their 30s and 40s are willing to believe anything because, for the past two decades, they have been in the business of making things believable.  What liberals see as a game of telephone being played by idiots with crap reception, conservatives call &#8220;reporting.&#8221;  Only without an Administration to accommodate their pretensions to reality&#8212;to interrupt the game with a reminder of the original statement&#8212;their message is running away from them so quickly that their latest champion is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB0wQDhKVcE">a guy whose hurt shoulder put him in a wheelchair</a>.  (Not that it&#8217;s impossible to suffer grave bodily harm and seem fine at first [as Kenneth Gladney did in <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/faking-victimhood-just-how-hurt-was">the video</a>]: <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/why_i_didnt_pos.html">I got hit by a car and walked home</a> because adrenaline works wonders.  But being drugged into speechless the day <em>after</em> you made the right-wing rounds for ten hours is mighty suspicious.)  Kenneth Gladney claims he was kicked and punched mercilessly and says the video backs him up.  Conservative blogs concur and Rush and Fox agree:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tape clearly shows that Gladney was beheaded by union jihadists personally selected by the Kenyan himself.  Pass it on.</p></blockquote>
<p>That Hannity will say this <em>while interviewing Gladney</em> demonstrates why he would never win a formal debate.  Not that he has to&#8212;the New Stupid will say he did no matter how he performed.  Rush will concur and conservative blogs will agree:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sean Hannity brought Gladney back from the dead with two toothpicks, a bottle of antifreeze and the power of Christ.  Pass it on.</p></blockquote>

						<p>If you want to have a meeting with only people that support your position, please go ahead &#8211; just don&#8217;t call it a &#8220;Town Hall&#8221; meeting.  That term is reserved for hearing how the entire town feels.<br />
There are two types of opposition to the current health care bill &#8212; people who don&#8217;t want to assume the massive cost of funding it (and don&#8217;t believe the President when he says he can do that without taxing them), and people who have health insurance and don&#8217;t want it destroyed by the addition of a massive federal bureaucracy.  To believe you can have a meeting with a true cross-section of the population and not hear these criticisms of the thousand page monster sitting in Washington is truly out-of-touch.</p>

						<p><em>If you want to have a meeting with only people that support your position, please go ahead&#8212;just don’t call it a “Town Hall” meeting.</em></p>
<p>I never claimed that only people who supported Policy X should be allowed in, only that if Group Y sponsors a debate about Policy X, it is not unreasonable for Group Y to reserve seats for its members.  As I noted, Republicans hosted a town hall that only allowed entry to doctors, but that&#8217;s perfectly fine, because the hospital they worked for sponsored the town hall.</p>
<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s not as if Carnahan&#8217;s town hall excluded <em>every single conservative</em>.  They allowed as many in as they could fit&#8212;but conservatives are upset because they couldn&#8217;t sit in the seats reserved for members of the group sponsoring the event.  Those seats, conservatives claim, should have gone to one of the 1,500 people the room couldn&#8217;t hold, because they were there and anything less than full-access is a boot on the neck of the First Amendment.  </p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>However, like Bruce, you&#8217;re just proving my point: you didn&#8217;t read my post, but you object to its content unaware that my point is that a certain new breed of conservatives object to the content of stuff they&#8217;re ignorant about, because they heard tell from so-and-so, a Facebook friend who dated their sister for three weeks in high school and is well-regarded in the community, that Obama&#8217;s death squad will &amp;c.</p>

						<p>I thought there was also the type of opposition to the current health care bill that wants government to keep their hands out of Medicare, and the type of opposition to the current health care bill that thinks that if we provide health coverage to everyone &#8212; like every other industrialized nation &#8212; government bureaucrats will come to euthanize Grandma.</p>
<p><i>people who have health insurance and don’t want it destroyed by the addition of a massive federal bureaucracy</i></p>
<p>These people haven&#8217;t been paying attention, because I&#8217;m fairly certain the bill does not do anything to touch current health insurance.  Or, more to the point, they are objecting to the bill because they believe the free market provides ponies to all, or they object in principle to government programs that might actually work, or they are bought and paid for by health insurers, or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the objection is to meeting with people who disagree with your position; it&#8217;s to letting brownshirts disrupt debate and lie shamelessly about the content of this legislation.  I am not hostile to the view that we don&#8217;t want to assume the massive cost of funding healthcare, and would be interested to know exactly what they propose to do to slow the growth in healthcare costs.</p>

						<p>At least there is debate on the health care bill. </p>
<p>The PATRIOT Act, which expressly contradicts Constitution rights in places, was passed overnight, with no discussion.</p>
<p>How much have we wasted on an illicit war so far? </p>
<p>We spend $750 billion a year on the Pentagon and war-related efforts. To the pharmaceutical industry, at brand-name prices, we spent $260 billion. Currently.</p>
<p>Oh, and Cliff? Go back and read your insurance policy, and find out how much you &#8220;lifetime&#8221; coverage will pay out, and figure out if you need a heart attack or a heart transplant to run that out. Because your &#8220;insurance&#8221; is limited. Go ahead, don&#8217;t believe me, get out that policy and read. Post it online, prove me wrong.</p>

						<p><i>There are two types of opposition to the current health care bill — people who don’t want to assume the massive cost of funding it (and don’t believe the President when he says he can do that without taxing them), and people who have health insurance and don’t want it destroyed by the addition of a massive federal bureaucracy.</i></p>
<p>Cliff, those are entirely valid criticisms of the bill and it would be absolutely wonderful to have people making those points in a respectful, civil fashion.  It would not only be a good sign of the health of our democracy, of course, but practically speaking, having a real discussion on the cost and bureaucratic impact of the reform would only serve to make the resulting health care legislation better.</p>
<p>But can you point me to evidence of those criticisms being raised at town hall meetings?  Because I haven&#8217;t seen them.  I&#8217;ve been following this pretty closely, and I just haven&#8217;t seen them.  </p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve seen lots of criticisms that fall outside your two categories &#8212; people claiming falsely that the health care reform will impose <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWAYDtI3ru4" rel="nofollow">euthanasia</a> on senior citizens, people claiming falsely that it will give health care to illegal aliens, people claiming falsely that it will create &#8220;death panels&#8221; that will put special needs children to death, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve seen lots of videos of mobs <a href="http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/?id=3137094" rel="nofollow">chanting angrily</a>, pushing and shoving, and <a href="http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/?id=3108210" rel="nofollow">not allowing</a> their fellow citizens and elected representatives to discuss this issue.  </p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/?id=3140552" rel="nofollow">lots and lots and lots of people at these rallies</a> making death threats, showing signs with congressmen being lynched or their names etched on tombstones, bringing guns and making death threats, using Nazi imagery and everything else to slander their political opponents.</p>
<p>This country really does need to have a debate on health care, Cliff, and I honestly would welcome a principled conservative voice to the table.  But I don&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>In the end, it doesn&#8217;t seem like those who are opposed to the reform movement are interested in having an actual debate.  Rather, they&#8217;re looking to shout down the discussion, to demonize their fellow Americans with scurrilous lies and malicious smears.</p>

						<p>This was a richly satisfying insight into the hypocrisies of the new American conservatives. The contradictions are just about pathological. It makes me wonder if parts of America are plumbed with lead pipes. </p>
<p>They defend American jobs, yet flock to the Walmarts to indulge in cheap Chinese goods crafted by the workers who took their jobs. They go bankrupt in droves from healthcare expenses, yet resist healthcare reform. They don&#8217;t want to pay taxes, but still want the government to regulate the safety of their food, water, and transit. They oppose medical research that will see them live to witness their own great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Have they been here the entire time, but have only now found a voice? Have people always been this stupid, this incapable of self reflection, analysis and consistency?</p>

						<p>SEK, you sure you didn&#8217;t spoof troll your own post?  As you say, Bruce&#8217;s comment is just too good. </p>
<p>Not sure of the accuracy of <a href="http://www.newmajority.com/talk-radio-gets-angrier-as-its-revenues-drop" rel="nofollow">this stat</a>, but apparently talk radio has lost a lot of ad revenue (more than 30% over the past two years) and this has led to a ratcheting up of the rhetoric to attract more of the core, wingnut audience.  (I can easily imagine that something similar is happening on the internet.)  In any case, the economics of rightwing media is something that I would be interested in seeing added to your analysis.  </p>
<p>One caution: I think most of the folks turning up at town hall meetings are being organized through email distribution lists and social networking sites rather than through blogs, which complicates your analysis somewhat.</p>

						<p>Before we go on, I wonder what professions and stations in life we have represented in our discussion?  The debate on raising taxes for healthcare depends on where you stand relative to the $200K-$300K mark, and what wealth you have accumulated, or, on your vision of the future.<br />
The other issue depends on your view of the &#8216;American dream&#8217; &#8211; what made our country prosperous.   The generation before me just wanted a good steady job and the ability to retire at 65.  What is the new vision?  Can you retire early if you work all your life under a 40%-50% tax rate?  I paid 25-30% my entire working life &#8211; that means you work Monday and part of Tuesday for the government, before you can pay bills or start saving.<br />
Will corporations continue in their present form, or will most of  you work under an amalgam of government and business?  Will / can entrepreneurship survive, or will it be necessary, or even useful?  What perceived rewards will drive it, if it exists?<br />
Socialized medicine works fine, an Australian friend tells me.  The doctors still make above average incomes there &#8211; I haven&#8217;t checked the facts.  I really don&#8217;t see that bill and the current insurance system working side-by-side for very long.<br />
I read some IRS statistics that show 40% of the population pays no taxes.  Is that number growing?  What government will you live under when more people vote than pay taxes?  What will be your incentive to work, in that case?  I&#8217;ve had some nice jobs, but none that I would show up at, for free.<br />
Market forces are pretty easy to understand.  What works, survives, and what doesn&#8217;t, dies.  Government can overwhelm the market &#8211; even well-meaning government.<br />
I say all this to provide just a hint of insight into conservative thinking.  I am not one, by the way :^)</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve written a very insightful post, and I think you&#8217;re largely correct. For a fair number of these folks losing an election equals tyranny because they have no experience in not being able to set the agenda. They have a visceral anger that is so easily exploited by the Republican operatives who understand One Big Thing: if they let Obama fix healthcare (and the economy improves substantially by 2012) they&#8217;ll be in the political wilderness for the foreseeable future. So they&#8217;re throwing everything they&#8217;ve got into a sort of scorched-earth effort. For them, the future is now, and they simply have to stop this thing.</p>

						<p>Cliff, the number you&#8217;re quoting is for the Federal income tax.  40% (or whatever, I don&#8217;t know the exact number) don&#8217;t pay income tax, but they pay social security taxes, they pay state sales taxes, real estate taxes, etc.  At the same time, the rich can avoid taxes by structuring payoffs as capital gains.  Famously, Warren Buffett pays taxes at a lower percentage rate than his secretary.  When you add them all up, the actual tax rate for all but the very poorest is pretty flat.</p>

						<p>kevin &#8211; I misspoke, stating those reasons as comprehensive, rather than as examples from a list.  I thought Galvinj made good points &#8211; there is opposition based on fears about Medicare &#8211; there&#8217;s a video of 65-plus&#8217;s (verbally) attacking an AARP spokesman;   the &#8220;Euthanize Grandma&#8221; comes from the Obama &#8211; Jane Sturm exchange ending in &#8220;just take a pill.&#8221;  It became the perfect example for certain fears &#8211; that a politically appointed committee would be making life and health decisions.  Concerns about the cost play off the CBO announcement;  concerns about bureaucracy come from reading the 1000+ page bill.<br />
Just as a placeholder, I believe opposition would be less to a proposal to give the Congressional Health plan to the &#8217;40 million people now without insurance&#8217;.  Do this under a framework of a third party organization to separate the fix from criticisms of current Government health programs.  When this is successful, people with rising insurance costs will want to move to it.<br />
All of the concerns expressed on Foxnews and Conservative talk have responses.  It is intellectually lazy to dismiss them as &#8216;stupid&#8217;, which I believe is the purpose of the original post.</p>

						<p>Cliff, you&#8217;ve completely misunderstood the point of this post, which isn&#8217;t about health care at all.  It&#8217;s about why a certain number of people have gone completely wacko.  If you regularly read comments at liberal or centrist blogs, the change in tone from certain types of commenters has been quite striking.  Scroll up and read Bruce&#8217;s comment for an example.</p>

						<p><i>the “Euthanize Grandma” comes from the Obama – Jane Sturm exchange ending in “just take a pill.”</i></p>
<p>Really?  Watch that exchange again &#8212; the short video here &#8212; and tell me how anyone with a fair mind could see that as the president encouraging euthanasia. </p>
<p>Sturm was asking about whether the &#8220;joy of life&#8221; in an elderly patient &#8212; like her 100 year old mother &#8212; should weigh in on medical decisions, like surgery to install a pacemaker at her age.  </p>
<p>Obama ducks the question on &#8220;joy of life&#8221; because he&#8217;s not a doctor, a philosopher or a medical ethicist, and pivots to a point about doctors making useless surgeries like that one because the current insurance system rewards them for the number of procedures they do.  He&#8217;s saying doctors should be encouraged to make the right call for their patients based on medical facts, pure and simple.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Just take a pill&#8221; is most certainly <b>not</b> him calling for the elderly to be put to sleep as so many on the right have baldly lied, but rather &#8212; as he says in plain English there &#8212; him saying maybe the best medical course is &#8220;not having the surgery but taking the painkiller.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>It became the perfect example for certain fears – that a politically appointed committee would be making life and health decisions.</i></p>
<p>Here we agree.  It did become the perfect example for certain fears &#8212; but only because those on the right chose not to debate the merits or the demerits of the president&#8217;s argument, but to insist that he was encouraging euthanasia of the old.  </p>
<p>This was a concerted effort to distort and to lie, to spread malicious untruths in an effort to scare seniors and make them fear for their lives.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_swq3NLEnw" rel="nofollow">Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich</a> &#8212; both of whom should know better &#8212; have spread this lie and fanned the flames to new heights.  Good Lord, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fL3cBbV_Yo" rel="nofollow">Fox News</a> even compared the health plan to &#8220;Soylent Green.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, but that <i>is</i> stupid.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but market forces eliminated all the health care firms covering elderly folks because it wasn&#8217;t profitable, so we won&#8217;t sell you a policy, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

						<p><i>Market forces are pretty easy to understand. What works, survives, and what doesn’t, dies.</i></p>
<p>So why are conservatives so up in arms over the addition of a public option as an alternative &#8212; not a replacement, as a competing alternative &#8212; to the current system of private insurance?  The market works through open and honest competition, right?  </p>
<p>Public options in other businesses work just fine.  FedEx and UPS compete well against the United States Postal Service, right?  Why wouldn&#8217;t the same be true in health insurance?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I love how free market folks always trot out the argument of &#8220;well, if you had to mail a very important letter tomorrow, which one would you use &#8212; FedEx or the Post Office?&#8221;  Hmm.  If it&#8217;s just me we&#8217;re talking about and I only had one letter to mail, sure, I&#8217;d probably spend the $29.50 to send it FedEx.  But if I were, oh, a nation of 304,000,000 people and sent about 170,000,000,000 pieces of mail a year, the post office would look awfully tempting.</p>

						<p><i>&#8220;Market forces are pretty easy to understand. What works, survives, and what doesn’t, dies.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Exactly, Cliff.</p>
<p>So what does it mean, comparative advantage wise, when the US is the last industrialized country with a &#8220;market&#8221; health care system that has &#8220;lived&#8221;, and in every other industrialized country it has &#8220;died&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how many people are all in favor of a free market &#8212; until the market disagrees with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://hal-obrien.livejournal.com/357829.html" rel="nofollow">I&#8217;ve written about the topic of health care before</a>. I think the biggest thing that isn&#8217;t being covered is how large corporations are in favor of the <i>status quo</i> because it a) instills fear and uncertainty in employees, b) gives them a hiring advantage against smaller, more nimble possible competitors who may not be able to afford health care for their employees, and c) discourages their most talented employees from leaving and starting possible competing companies of their own, for fear of losing health care benefits for themselves and their prospective employees. I think those large corporations are using more ideologically-based adversaries of reform as proxies, in a &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221; move.</p>
<p>American business is all in favor of competition &#8212; in theory. As long as it stays &#8212; in theory.</p>

<p>People forget even more that some places had private firefighting companies, while others had public ones, the two systems competed against each other, and the public ones won in the marketplace.</p>

<p>In many places, you can&#8217;t even turn on your own garden hose to fight your own fire without government-controlled water coming out.  How can anyone fight a fire if they only have access to inefficient Big Government water and not awesome free market water?  (The free market, incidentally, is awesome at delivering the same water as the government, inefficiently and at considerable cost, while convincing its customers it&#8217;s providing them a service.)</p>

						<p>Before I begin, let me thank everybody who thinks I&#8217;m awesome.  I completely agree with you.</p>
<p><em>I think most of the folks turning up at town hall meetings are being organized through email distribution lists and social networking sites rather than through blogs, which complicates your analysis somewhat.</em></p>
<p>Listservs absolutely play a part in it, but most of those solidify connections people already had before the internet, or are quasi-professional or church-related, which I suppose also means people you already had connect with before the internet.  You&#8217;re right, though, that I need to take aggressive forwarding of stuff like Sarah Palin&#8217;s Facebook updates into account.</p>
<p><em>Bystanders cannot tell the difference.</em></p>
<p>Maybe not, dana, but I can.  For awhile I felt compelled to post about whatever the pressing matter of the day was.  No more!</p>
<p>Hal, the firefighter comparison is a brilliant one, because even the staunchest libertarians would never consider a for-profit firefighting company a good thing.  <em>Of course</em> the firefighters will come and stop your house from burning down; however, if you happen to be in it at the time and suffer any sort of injury . . . </p>
<p>Benjamin Black, thanks for the recommendation.</p>
<p><em>It reminds me of the book “What’s the matter with Kansas?” by Thomas Frank which a friend once gave me. Actually, the New Stupid could be a sequel to that book.</em></p>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of <em>The Wrecking Crew</em>, which I&#8217;d forgotten I&#8217;d read and to which this post is clearly indebted.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve a guilty interest in the notion that the Party of the Free Market/Individual&#8217;s correct response to heavy government involvement in health care should be to shift the rhetorical emphasis onto the responsibility of ordinary Americans to take care of themselves, and their comparative (in)efficacy in doing so.  Not peep one on that side of the coin: <i>drop the cigs, the cell-drivin, and a few pounds, then we&#8217;ll talk health care</i><i>.

						<p>kevin &#8211; Conservatives are up in arms about a public health option because it is not offered on an equal basis.<br />
The government requires minimum coverage and gets to define what constitutes minimum insurance coverage.  Any private company that doesn&#8217;t meet the minimum, as decided by the government, pays an 8% payroll tax, so a company that gives up and goes 100% public option has a competitive advantage over a company that tries to keep it&#8217;s own coverage.<br />
I can&#8217;t believe (all of you) use the Post Office and Medicare in arguments for the government to take over anything.  Try to find an article on the web on either that doesn&#8217;t use the words &#8220;bankrupt&#8221; and/or &#8220;deficit&#8221;.<br />
As to the &#8220;death panel&#8221;, I acknowledge the term is hyperbole.  The current bill does include a group to set standards of care that will result in some people receiving treatment and others being denied treatment.  Insurance companies already do this &#8211; why hasn&#8217;t anyone used that argument?<br />
If you want to know a conservative&#8217;s fears about this panel, engage in a thought experiment with me.  Imagine the panel staffed by George Bush, Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, and Karl Rove.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe you missed the point that people were making by invoking the Post Office and Medicare in their arguments.</p>
<p>(cf, the possibility of having successful private competition to government funded activity, and get back to us.  This also deals with your first point.)</p>
<p><i> Insurance companies already do this – why hasn’t anyone used that argument?</i></p>
<p>Lots of folks have, albeit not in this particular thread.</p>

<p>You mean, &#8220;why hasn&#8217;t anyone <i>on Fox</i> used this argument?&#8221; Because it&#8217;s been part of most of the discussions I&#8217;ve been reading.</p>

						<p>Cliff Miller isn&#8217;t real, is he? I mean, he&#8217;s gotta be a sockpuppet created by SEK to prove the point of this post. The point of this post being that the level of political debate in the United States has reached new lows, with people constantly changing the subject in mid-debate (or simply screaming at each other) so that no real political conversation actually happens.</p>
<p>As someone with a bias towards social history, from a methodological standpoint it would be very interesting to come up with some kind of metric for judging the quality of public political debate over the past 50 years or so.m I don&#8217;t know what that would look like, but it would be interesting to see the graph that results, with the Y-axis being quality of debate (0=screaming pointlessly at each other, 100=Abe Lincoln), and the X-axis being time.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t &#8220;hyperbole&#8221; it is a pure fabrication and the rankest sort of deceit.  Hyperbole entails some kind of exaggeration, but there is nothing to base this exaggeration on.  Yes, there is a &#8220;panel&#8221; that decides standards of care in bills.  To turn that into death panels practising Khmer Rouge style eugenics requires not just an exaggeration of their function, but a complete rewrite on them. </p>
<p>I think you bring that up to kind of explain away how these lies get started.  But it only serves to highlight the despicable tactics of those opposed to reform.  They&#8217;re taking common sense, required elements of any health care system and contorting them into something frightening.</p>
