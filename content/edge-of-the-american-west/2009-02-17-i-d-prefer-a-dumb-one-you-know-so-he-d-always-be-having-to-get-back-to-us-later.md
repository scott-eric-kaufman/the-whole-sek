## I’d prefer a dumb one, you know, so he’d always be having to get back to us later.

It upsets [Mary Rosh](http://www.whoismaryrosh.com/) that Leno and Letterman [refuse to mock Obama](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jlott/2009/02/17/obama-using-teleprompter-at-press-conferences-where-are-the-comedy-routines/) for using a teleprompter during his press conferences.  It _infuriates_ her that Obama wants the White House to install a smart podium:

Obama is looking to install a computer screen into the podium so that, according to one Obama advisor, “It would make it easier for the comms guys to pass along information without being obvious about it.”  Obama’s aids would put together answers to a large number of possible questions so as soon as a reporter asks a particular question the computer screen would flash talking points to remind Obama how he’s supposed to respond to that question.

Why would a President—especially an ostensibly intellectual one—want aides to feed facts and figures to his podium on the sly?  Are we witnessing the first step down [that slippery slope](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553383434/diesekoschmar-20)?

I think not.  Consider:


![ssl162-21](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/ssl162-21.jpg?w=300&h=225 "ssl162-21")

That is a picture of the actual classroom in which I teach my 8 a.m. class.  Notice the podium hulking in the corner?  It is _made of computers_.  Know what happens when a student stumps me with a question?  I confab with computers so that I might provide the student with an accurate answer.  This is not to say that I come to class unprepared.  I have done my homework.  I come armed with [my notes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html).  But sometimes a student still manages to stop me in my tracks.  Consider a conversation from this morning:

**Me:** It seems like Nolan shot this with the aid of a steadicam.

**Student:** You mean “_with_ a steadicam.”

**Me:** No, a steadicam is something [you attach to a camera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam).

**Student:** My father works in Hollywood and were he here all anyone in this building would be able to hear was him laughing because you are dumb.

At which point I stopped the lecture.  Walked to the podium.  Searched the internet.  Brought up that link.  Took me about thirty seconds total—which means _that_ _for thirty seconds my class consisted of my students watching me search the internet_.  You know what would have been nice?  If I had a staffer whose job it was to do these searches for me so that the results might appear instantly on my podium computer.  I would waste less time and be more accurate.  (For the record: I was not out to humiliate the student.  I teach them that the cardinal sin of the Age of Information is the easily correctable factual error.  The above is an example of me practicing what I preach.)

But Rosh and her commenters will have none of it.  Their beloved Limbaugh employs a staff to feed him information during his show—but he is not a President.  The President is a man who should want for nothing.  The man who is President needs a lot.  He “needs a cheat sheet.”  (As did I on [my qualifying exams](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/what-are-qualif.html).)  He “needs help in just speaking.”  (As did I on [my qualifying exams](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/what-are-qualif.html).)  He “is our first Affirmative Action President [because] he needs extra help to do what things that we privileged white people can do with ease.”  (As do Jews just generally.)

Why should a president have a crack staff who feed him the exact figures in a spending bill or the precise wording of a policy?  Why should we value his apparent commitment to accuracy even when speaking extemporaneously?  How can we trust a president who has not already committed all 1,079 pages of the stimulus package to memory?  I think Ritchie speaks for us all: “We need to figure out how to have a recall election or impeach [Obama] on the grounds of being incapable of leading.”

God forbid a reporter ever asks _him_ what an impeachable offense is.

_You made the student cry, didn’t you?_

Nope.  They’ve seen me have to correct myself often enough to  know not to take it personally.  

_RE: the debate_

That’s largely why I don’t think we should model our presidential elections after high school forensics—or that we should model it more closely.  I had a debate partner, a couple of research aides (a.k.a. freshmen and sophomores) and a win was a team effort.  I like that idea better than the stuff-the-candidates-full-of-platitudes approach we have now.

_But is it a 2-fault tolerant podium made of computers?_

I don’t know what that means, so I’ll simply answer: Yes.

_Good to see that UC provides back-ups in terms of the whiteboard and the overhead projector to the left._

It doesn’t work.  I tried it once, because it’s easier to diagram a sentence on an overhead than the board or the computer, and it just sat there and hummed.  

_What would you do if wingnuts didn’t provide you with flamebait?  Blog about flossing your cat?_

Yes.  Not that this post is flame _bait_, mind you, since I’m not out to attract trolls.  But I am interested in how preconceived notions about social forms inflect debates about commonsense items like “Should the President have the most accurate information about a topic presented to him when he answers a completely random question posed by a sometimes hostile audience.”  The answer, as professors in smart classrooms across America will tell you, is _absolutely_.  When someone asks “On page 781 of the stimulus bill, it says X, Y and Z,” why shouldn’t the President have a chance to look at the page 781?  And if someone hands a copy already opened to page 781, isn’t that preferable to having the reporters twiddle their thumbs while the President finds the correct page?  That’s why my teaching copies have a rainbow of tabs sticking out of them.

**[Ahistoricality](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com)**

					

		

There was only one [Cardinal Sin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime\_Cardinal\_Sin); what this Pope has is a college of sinner cardinals.

What bugs me about that classroom (just like the ones I use) is that it’s _not_ arranged for a press conference: if you want to use the computer, you have to huddle in the corner because the assumption is that the computer is just a powerpoint vehicle and you _wouldn’t_ want people looking at you instead of the screen. (though that’s actually not a realistic model, either).

This post reminded me of a lovely moment I had on Facebook recently. A friend put in a status update to the effect of: [Name] is happy that we can finally call it “torture.”

One of the responses was: “You should ask Daniel Pearl’s widow how she defines torture.”

Here’s the great part: Mariane Pearl is on record worrying about the validity of KSM’s confession, because it was apparently obtained through torture. I provided the quote, plus the link to the article by Jane Mayer.

My friend removed the thread – I think he realized that torture-talk is a bit heavy duty for Facebook, but I had to thank him for providing me with the modern equivalent of [this Woody Allen moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpIYz8tfGjY) (see the last minute).

I also discovered that, as with everything else technology-related, Apple had this thought first. Note how they employ this scene to [sell the Iphone.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WocIL-q-Xzw)

Sorry, that was sort of ambiguous.  It was one of those “we’re both wrong/we’re both right moments.”  Comity was had by all.

I agree with you generally that it will be good for the president to have accurate information at his fingertips in order to more informatively answer questions.  However, I think that having a smart podium will increase the extent to which the presidents speech is scripted.  We already know that presidents employ speechwriters, and now those same writers will be able to formulate answers to questions which the president will be answering extemporaneously.  Technology like this will make it easier for the president to hide lack of knowledge on a subject from the people, as well as make it less likely that his extemporaneous answers will shed light on an issue in a way that his handlers have not previously determined beforehand.

_the cardinal sin of the Age of Information is the easily correctable factual error_

A venial sin, unless it’s “supported” by a link to a blog notorious for its correctable factual errors, a sign of investment of effort in being wrong.  And if it’s a link to, for example, Protein Wisdom, then a bolt of lightning sends you straight to hell, unless you’re already one of Satan’s minions.  Many walk the earth.

_Technology like this will make it easier for the president to hide lack of knowledge on a subject from the people_

Depends on how it’s used.  If Obama explicitly indicates he’s got incoming factuals, why not?  Let’s go all the way: let’s say you can see what he’s getting (or most of it) on an overhead screen.

I’ve often thought I’d like to have have some kind of social networking feature where I tweet “I’m arguing with one of THOSE people again”, and surreptitiously turn on the microphone on my laptop.  Friends can tune in, track the debate, and supply links to a common bookmark collection specifically for that conversation.  I sort of drag out my expressions of incredulity, to give my secret volunteer research staff a little time to dig up paydirt.  (“You’re saying that climate modelers have . . . completely . . .  neglected . . . water vapor in their calculations?  Neglected?  You’re sure of that?”)  Then I turn to my laptop and say, “Gee, I think found this thing somewhere — ah, there it is, popping up right on my first search, waddya know . . . .”

This isn’t wrong, but it is strange.  Press conferences aren’t for testing the president and grading him, they’re for communicating information that the President wants to communicate and/or reporters want to know (the latter overlaps the former too often).  And yes, it might mean fewer opportunities for gotchas where you find that the President said one thing on one occasion and something inconsistent on another.  But gotchas are stupid things.

I encourage my students to call me stupid.  An integral part of my ethos as a teacher is that I’m not any smarter than my kids, I’m merely older and happen to know more.  They can all be me.  (Somehow this is an effective incentive.  If only they knew!)

This should be the topic of another post, but 1) that’s not a direct quote from my student, but 2) a _very_ similar (albeit sarcastic) version of it was uttered by my first ever female wise-ass of a student.  I’ve taught brilliant women whose accomplishments in grad school far outstrip mine; and I’ve taught brilliant women who revealed their sarcasm in office hours; but I’ve never had a woman who was comfortable enough with the gender politics of my classroom to reveal how much of a wise-ass she was in class before this quarter.

I consider this a personal failure.

I like to make use of the students surfing the web on their laptops during lecture to look up those sorts of questions: “Hey – are you on line now?” directed to the obvious kid(s) – “would you look up the answer to that question please?” – then I get to go on with my class plan while someone else demonstrates the ease of checking on fact on the internet – it also tends to pull the wayward websurfer back to class – at least for a bit. 

As well as demonstrating the perils of obviously playing around on the web during class – you could be co-opted at any time as  research staff.
