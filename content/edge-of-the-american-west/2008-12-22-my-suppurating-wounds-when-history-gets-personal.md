_This is a guest post by my friend Jana Remy, a Ph.D. Candidate at UC Irvine and the founder of the [Making History Podcast and Blog](http://www.makinghistorypodcast.com/).  A longer, ramblier, vicodin-inspired version of this post first appeared [here](http://makinghistorypodcast.com/2008/07/24/my-laudable-pus-when-history-gets-personal/)._

_My left leg was propped up on the edge of the gurney as the ER doc sliced open the abscess on my calf to release the pus he needed for a bacterial culture.  He started to chatting with me deflect the tension of the moment.  As he grabbed various vials and swabbed the bleeding wound he asked me why I was traveling alone in Denver. My reply, “I’m getting a PhD, writing a dissertation chapter on 19th century medical history in the American West. I’ll be working in archives at the Historical Society this week.”_

My dissertation research about 19th century medical history is  fueled by my experiences as a medical patient.  Most recently, for the past four months I’ve battled a mysterious antibiotic-resistant infection in my left leg (the jury is still out about whether the infection is [MRSA](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mrsa/DS00735) or an atypical [mycobacterium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium)—just today I had an MRI scan and we hope to draw yet another wound culture by the end of the week).\*  I can’t help but draw parallels between my own rather gruesome ailment and the “suppurating wounds” full of “[laudable pus](http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Laudable\_pus)” that I’ve read about in postbellum American medical journals. This situation truly came to head a few weeks ago while I was in Denver on a research trip and my infection recurred; I became a patient in one of the very hospitals that I aimed to study during my stint in town.

In pondering my intimate relationship with my research topic, I’ve considered the writings of ethnographers [Ruth Behar](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)Translated-Woman-Ruth-Behar%!F(MISSING)dp%!F(MISSING)0807046477%!F(MISSING)ie%!D(MISSING)UTF8%!s(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)books%!q(MISSING)id%!D(MISSING)1216851515%!s(MISSING)r%!D(MISSING)1-3&tag=makinghistory-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=makinghistory-20&l=ur2&o=1) and [Greg Sarris](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)Mabel-McKay-Weaving-Portraits-American%!F(MISSING)dp%!F(MISSING)0520209680%!F(MISSING)ie%!D(MISSING)UTF8%!s(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)books%!q(MISSING)id%!D(MISSING)1216851341%!s(MISSING)r%!D(MISSING)8-1&tag=makinghistory-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=makinghistory-20&l=ur2&o=1). Weaving their personal stories with their histories adds a weight to their work that moves beyond a story frozen in time captured by an objective observer. It seems more than coincidence that the writers’ lives are so closely tied to those of their subjects.  As Behar writes, “You don’t choose to write the books you write, any more than you choose your mother, your father, your brother, or your comadre” (_Translated Woman_, xi). Am I to imagine that the angel of history dropped down from the sky and offered me this gift of a story, as an offering to this poor graduate student struggling to prove the significance of her obscure research topic about medical practices at the dawning of the age of germ theory? Because of the closeness of my research to my current medical drama,  I’m tempted to mirror some of Behar and Sarris’ techniques in my own work, weaving my story along with those I study.   But I wonder at the possible folly of such an approach—historians who study the 19th century (or earlier eras) don’t tend to get personal with their subject matter.  It seems the only acceptable approach is to bookend one’s “real research” with personal reflections, as do [Bill Cronon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)Natures-Metropolis-Chicago-Great-West%!F(MISSING)dp%!F(MISSING)0393308731%!F(MISSING)ie%!D(MISSING)UTF8%!s(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)books%!q(MISSING)id%!D(MISSING)1216852604%!s(MISSING)r%!D(MISSING)1-3&tag=makinghistory-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=makinghistory-20&l=ur2&o=1) and [Martha Hodes](http://makinghistorypodcast.com/tag/martha-hodes/).

Still, as I write my dissertation I aim to blur some of the traditional boundaries of the historical genre—adding literary elements and experimenting with the traditional textual form.  Though at this point it seems too far outside of the sphere of the dissertation to inject my personal experiences anywhere except in the Intro, I will still infuse my text with my own morbid fascination for medical detail.   Because how can I write a compelling vignette about battlefield surgery without injecting my freaky curiosity about the details of arterial ligature, techniques of amputation, and moist wound dressings?  And, given that I may well be writing my next chapter during the hours I’ll be whiling away hooked up to an antibiotic IV drip, such details hit painfully close to home (I’m wondering if I should hold out for [maggot therapy](http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/som/pathology/sherman/home\_pg.htm) to debride the infected tissue—wouldn’t that be the perfect story to include in the intro to my first book?).

\*\*\*

Antibiotic-resistant infections like MRSA have a history, one that begins in the nineteenth century with the professionalization and routinization of allopathic medical practice. The use of antibiotics as a [panacea for nearly any ailment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotics#Antibiotic\_resistance) became part of the performative “practice” of medicine by the late twentieth century—such antibiotics confidently prescribed by white-coated board-certified physicians who had little inkling of the consequences. Certainly they weren’t thinking of people like me, who have complex medical histories involving numerous necessary doses of antibiotics, and who are subsequently more susceptible to extra-resistant infections.

Thus, my fascination with medical history is profoundly personal.  It’s an attempt to understand the terrain of my own body.  It’s what I thought about for the hours I was recently an inpatient in my university’s hospital, where I was told I couldn’t bring any personal belongings (not even a book–the horror) because of rampant theft from patients.  So I was a book-less, laptop-less, cellphone-less patient with not much more to consider than the view out the window (a back alley), the pain in my leg (tooth-gritting), and my research objectives.\*\* I thought a lot about what it meant to write “professional” history and what it meant to tell stories.  The paranoid hypochondriac part of me also worried whether I would _ever_ get better and get on with my work, even as I realized that my own medical experiences aren’t just tangential to my work, they are at the heart of it.  And, in one fashion or another, they will be a part of everything I write.

I [documented](http://pilgrimgirl.blogspot.com/2008/08/inside-out.html) my [recovery](http://pilgrimgirl.blogspot.com/2008/08/what-has-to-be-done.html) on my [soloblog](http://www.pilgrimsteps.com).  

\*\*Actually, I also thought a lot about Foucault, which I found one can’t help but contemplate in a situation like mine—wondering whether one is in the “clinic” or the “prison.”  But that, of course, is another story.  And I should also note that there was __ a television in my corner of the ward, but I never turned it on because I haven’t watched TV in a few decades and I wasn’t about to start just because I was hospitalized, for crying out loud.

Warning! Warning! Jana Remy PhD Candidate! Don’t write a ground breaking dissertation that blurs the boundaries of the genre! Just finish. 

I know three people who wrote ground breaking dissertations with the blessings of their advisers/committees and none of them have been able to get a book contract. Two of them have completely pitched their manuscripts and started new projects on different topics with conventional narratives. Another has spent the last three months weeping and gnashing his/her teeth after being solicited and then rejected by a major press in the field. 

I know one person who had his dissertation published as a book. He wrote a completely ‘normal science’ dissertation using published sources. His dissertation was published after some revisions by the leading press in his sub field. Moral of the story: Nothing fancy. Just think done. Seriously. The cutting edge stuff will keep and you can do it later, (when you have your own blog like eotaw).

Finally, you will, and probably should, ignore the well meaning dissertation advice of myself and others.  The most valuable skill I learned in graduate school was how to listen to the advice of others (including my committee) and to go ahead and have the courage to do what I was thinking any way. 

(one last bit of advice, Never get off the boat). 

Happy dissertating and I hope your leg gets better!

I’m afraid I have to admit that I was unable to get any intellectual enjoyment out of this post at all, as the whole time I was merely squirming and thinking, “Oh God, please don’t let this ever happen to me,” and “Oh my God, is she ok?, is it getting better?” and “Oh my God, how can she be sitting here calmly discussing thoughtful issues when she has an antibiotic-resistant infection inside her leg which is slowly destroying and crawling through her flesh?!?!” 

You must not be OCD, because if I were you I couldn’t write one coherant page of anything, let alone a dissertation.

Matt: Thanks for the advice (I think).  Everyday I vacillate between the “get it done” and the “have some fun” approach.  Everyone tells me that if/when I get the magical tenure then I can get creative.  I just wonder sometimes if I’ll even make it that far and if it’s really worth waiting for…sigh…

RobinMarie: Should’ve added a squeamish disclaimer–my apologies.  FWIW, antibiotic-resistant infections aren’t so terribly unusual anymore (ask around and I bet you know a few people who’ve had MRSA–especially anyone who’s had recent surgery or outpatient treatment).  My advice: avoid hospitals and doctors’ clinics because they typically harbor the most virulent strains.

Have fun and get it done, too.  I think there are a lot of scholarly models that both tell a “professional”, scholarly story and that also make room for the author’s own voice. In fact, I was just on a panel at the Amer. Studies Association about this (of course, I can’t remember anyone from a history dept on the panel.  Hmm.)  I think publishers are attracted to this kind of work, too.

That said, I can see that the danger of trying to “have fun” and “get it done,” is that you agonize so much over the writing that it in fact delays the completion of the dissertation.  Professional formulas for writing are, well, formulaic, and that can be advantage when you are you are trying to complete a dissertation.  You don’t have to  wait for tenure to push the envelope a little — but you may want to wait until you are revising the diss for a book.  (I have a colleague who did that.  His first book — which basically became the best known book in his field — included creative interchapters in which characters actually speak in dialect.  It’s quite remarkable, but those pieces weren’t in the dissertation.)

jana,

One member of my committee gave me what ought to be the mantra for us all: “the best dissertation is the done dissertation.”  I had my fun in the research (field work involving car-camping in my ’68 VW, hanging out in grotty mining-town bars, pawing through police arrest records in unventilated broom closets, etc) and in writing chapter drafts, from which my wise mentor then showed me how to cut the evidence of having had too much fun in the research phase. 

Moral of story? Write your heart into the diss, be prepared to excise most of it, then keep it for post-defense revision into a groundbreaking book.

And ditto your last comment to RobinMarie; my oldest friend is an MD who teaches at a major Left Coast med school; he avoids hospitals like the plague for just the reason you cite.

Good luck, and keep that leg away from doctors if possible.  Especially if they want to try pouring whisky on the wound before giving you a good slug of same.

My day job is doctoring (with a little teaching of history of medicine on the side), and you describe your unfortunate situation very well. History of medicine has benefited during the past couple of decades from actual historians (rather than physician-amateurs) coming into the field, so I encourage you to forge ahead in your work. I especially encourage you to try whatever novel approaches your dissertation committee will allow. It’s pretty clear to me that history of medicine is a good window into many fascinating and useful aspects of social history.

Best of luck to you and your poor leg.

This post reminds me of this [list of incredible self-surgeries](http://listverse.com/health/top-10-incredible-self-surgeries).  I’m a wuss for pain and not very adept at working with my own wounds, so bless your heart for what you’re having to go through, Jana.  Here’s wishing you a definitive diagnosis, a speedy recovery, a successful dissertation, and a wee bit of luck going into the new year!
