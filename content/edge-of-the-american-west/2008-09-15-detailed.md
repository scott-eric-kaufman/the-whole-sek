Jonah Goldberg’s [modest opinion](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=) of his own work:

It is a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care.

Jonah Goldberg’s serious, thoughtful argument about John McCain’s time in a North Vietnamese prison, presented in detail and with care:

The reason he doesn’t send email is that he can’t use a keyboard because of the relentless beatings he received from _the Viet Cong_ in service to our country.

Not that I [expect any better](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html), but if you’ve written about a war between North and South Vietnam, shouldn’t you know the difference between North and South Vietnam?

[Hilzoy](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian\_wings/2008/09/sigh.html) jumped on this too.  I was also confused, I’m embarrassed to say, until I did some looking-up.

“Viet Cong” refers to the South Vietnamese communists army, doesn’t it?  There were relations between it and the Viet Minh, but since McCain was shot down and held in North Vietnam, I don’t think you put his torture on the Viet Cong.  (You wouldn’t say John Brown supported the Confederacy, I don’t think.  Not a perfect analogy, but you see my point.)

_Picky picky._

That’s _detailed and careful_ to you, grackle.

I’m about three weeks behind in my I-don’t-contribute-to-them blog reading, Vance.  Damn it.  I need to catch up before I mouth off.

Huh, I suppose that may be right.  I probably should do some looking up of my own.  I guess it just never occurred to me to consider who McCain’s captors were; I just assumed he was held by the Viet Cong.

If only someone had been around to tell the Vietnamese to stop the bullshit.

If you guys were as old as I am you (a) wouldn’t be confused by what’s wrong with this and (b) would have seen this mistake/lie so often you wouldn’t be surprised.

Just how a young turd like Goldberg picked it up, however, is a little puzzling.

Okay, now that I’ve looked into this, I’ve realized the error of my ways:  McCain/Palin ’08.  Thanks for enlightening me, SEK!

[Also](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/12/yes-mccain-can-use-electr\_n\_126130.html), there is the question of fact in the current-events part of Goldberg’s argument; there is the question of what Obama’s ad says—McCain doesn’t use a computer; doesn’t mention keyboards, and [people use computers without using keyboards](http://www.hawking.org.uk/text/disable/computer.html).

But I thought that, with the Palin nomination, we’ve entered a post-fact era!

Those who question Jonah Goldberg’s knowledge of anything are just being 
sexist
….er, weight-insensitive…or something!

Antisemitic.

Actually, I think we probably have.

Yes sir, and might I say, sir, what a nice turn of phrase it is, sir.

_You wouldn’t say John Brown supported the Confederacy, I don’t think. Not a perfect analogy, but you see my point._

That’s actually an atrocious analogy.  The Viet Cong were on the same side as the NVA, and both were fighting against the US and the ARVN at the same time.  John Brown was fighting against the US Army, just like the confederacy, but on behalf of the opposite cause, and before the Civil War started.

Goldberg’s mistake is a big and stupid one, but not at all comparable to that John Brown thing.

We entered the ‘Post fact era’ about 1980 IIRC.

Right.  He _should_ have said that it’s like saying John Brown supported Canada.

thing about mccain is:

either he is capable of using computers–with various kinds of assistance–or not.

if he is capable–through voice recognition, through skilled human assistants, and so on–then he has effectively overcome his physical injuries. bravo! now why is he so goddamn pig-ignorant about the internet? could it be because he is mentally old, inflexible, and incurious?

if he is not capable, even with assistance, of using computers, then this is serious, serious, liability. you might even call it a disqualification. this is something you need to be able to do, to be a competent president in this day and age.

oh–but maybe the right wing and republicans are now going to say that the handicapped should enjoy the soft bigotry of low expectations?  and get to have the nuclear codes too!

Yeah, it was John _McCain_ who supported the Confederacy. Drove Brown nuts.

“Drove Brown nuts.”

yup. he just lies there a spinning and a mouldering, a mouldering and a spinning.

I’m guessing that his meticulous research sources include both  McCain _and_ Steve Schmidt. The difference between North and South is simply a matter of timing, after all. Lee, you recall, was once a _Union_ officer. Yep. All a matter of timing.
