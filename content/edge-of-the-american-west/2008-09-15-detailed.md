Jonah Goldberg’s [modest opinion](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=) of his own work:

It is a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care.

Jonah Goldberg’s serious, thoughtful argument about John McCain’s time in a North Vietnamese prison, presented in detail and with care:

Not that I [expect any better](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html), but if you’ve written about a war between North and South Vietnam, shouldn’t you know the difference between North and South Vietnam?
