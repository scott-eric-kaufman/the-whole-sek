My poor briswired main.  Years of [thiligent derapy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/the-future-of-p.html#comment-93774388) may have allowed me to sound like a palking terson, but not a pay dasses that I don’t bumble stadly.  If you didn’t know bany etter, you’d think I did this pon urpose.

Die on’t.

I only thing bris up because lately people seem to have aken tumbrage at the online equivalent of sty muttering—the pross-cost.

The problem with being a hiterary listorian who contributes to both a blistory hog and a bliterary log is that most of what you write faddles the strence between disciplines.  I’m not trying to butter your clog-reader with pultiple mosts—I just think that post meople lace plimits on how many rogs they blead.

So if you’d kike to low how conservatives reacted to the death of John Updike, [lick on this clink](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/must\_we\_still\_pretend\_to\_like\_john\_updike/) to find out.

If you surmise that this all came from a conversation in which I said both “blistory hog” and “bliterary log,” people probably think well of you for always noticing when they’ve gotten a new cair hut.

Blistory hog.  Gat thot a loud laugh mout of e.  It’s ight rup there with the spassic cloonerism from Speverend Rooner himself: “The Lord is a Shoving Lepard.”

The balls of that stupid reactionary virgin thinking that he has any business to judge Updike as either a writer or a man.  I’d like to pound his stupid smug face into the granite curb starred with mica and add a smattering of his dull red blood.

(Alright ari, I’ve had three drinks.)

Sir Charles –

Are you a refugee from the 60’s?  It’s the conservatives who are violent these days.

Better get a coffee before your local Starbuck’s closes.

7:30 am meeting with the kid’s chemistry teacher.  (Time to make #4).

jazzbumpa,

As a labor movement guy, I think it improtant to reclaim violence and make it our own.

That’s “important” — damn cheap bourbon. Another drink and I’ll be writing (and spelling) like Yglesias without the Harvard diploma.

This post shouldn’t cause self-criticism, Sir Charles.  (Also, _being_ an Updike character while _defending_ an Updike character is its own reward, no?)

Indeed.  

Like the guy who took over the Margart Mitchell franchise, I am hoping to market a prequel titled “Rabbit Fuckin’ Rulez.”

Possible you mean “knike to low”? (Perhaps the couple of “bris” influenced a typo.)

Bizarre to see him attacking Updike at the point of most obvious strength.

the loss of John Updike makes me wonder if the literary world is being replenished at the same rate that it’s losing such great writers

To be fair, some leftists [were just as eager](http://www.historiann.com/2009/01/27/rabbit-ran-out/) to spit on Updike’s newly-dug grave.

I dunno, Jeremy.  Historiann’s article has some feminist-based criticism, then moves on to speak quite affectionately of some of his work.  And, unlike that other guy, she knows what she’s talking about.

Jeremy,

I can’t really imagine writing about Updike and trying to sum him up without commenting on (or seemingly having read) the Rabbit quartet.  

Undoubtedly Updike is a man of a certain time and can be critiqued for his phallocentric sensibility, but there is a great deal of truth and beauty in those four volumes and they are not simply white, male truths I think.

Of course as a white male, I just might be looking at him through my privillege colored glasses.

I’d put aside the Rabbit books shortly into _Rabbit Is Rich_, and Updike’s death made me pick it up again.

He’s not an easy writer to describe, IMHO, because what makes him good isn’t any Message About The Human Condition, so much as the sheer quality of his prose.  And describing “the quality of his prose” is one of those desperate exercises that leads to saying “look, just read it, okay?”

Haven’t got the book in front of me, but Updike’s prose is just so _surprising_ — he chooses a word, creates a phrase, that isn’t at all where one expected the sentence to go, but which works beautifully.  It may look a lot easier than it is.

On the Guardian’s book page, I keep being struck by [this photo](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/gallery/2009/jan/27/john-updike?picture=342409466).  U looks about twelve, and also a good bit older. (Plus the image is intensely ‘period’: those colors, which we’ve seen in movies too, must derive from a particular film stock.)

Updike writes “writes prose the only way it should be written” the only way it should be written.

Essear, are you thinking of Nicholson Baker’s _U and I_?  (“Ecstatically.”)

Ecstatically, yes, but via the blurb Vintage prints on the cover of every single thing Nabokov ever wrote.

**[Vance](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)**

					

		

Ah, of course you’re right, I’d forgotten that was by Updike rather than about him. A little imprecise, in either case, no? The prose may induce ecstasy, but doesn’t suggest (to me) that either author was himself in transports at the time.

when addressing the society for farm labourers:  

“i have never previously spoken to so many tons of soil,…”

and then for meta-spoonerisms, leofranc holford-strevens (yes, his real name–and a cracker-jack latinist) got off a nifty during a public debate at oxford:

“i will say in his praise that my opponent is a shining wit–as dr. spooner would have said–”

(perhaps that’s not really a meta-spoonerism. the “meta-” prefix may not name a unique operation. one kind of meta-spoonerism would be “noonerspism”, i suppose, if we think of “spoonerizing” as switching sequential initial consonants, and think of “meta-” as “apply the operation to the operator”, and so attempt to spoonerize “spoonerism”. but that understanding of ‘meta-‘ will leave out many cases. holford-strevens is ‘meta-‘ i suppose in that it requires one to be aware of the genre of spoonerisms in order to appreciate this particular spoonerism?? man, nothing like parenthetical analytical divagations on the mechanisms humor to bring the lols!!).

sorry.
