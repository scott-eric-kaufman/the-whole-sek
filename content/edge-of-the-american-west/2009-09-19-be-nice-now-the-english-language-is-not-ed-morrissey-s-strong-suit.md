## Be nice, now. The English language is not Ed Morrissey’s strong suit, and he at least makes a show of reining in the racist comments he knowingly baits from his audience.

It seems Mr. Ed Morrissey [caught President Obama fibbing again](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/).  See, Michelle Obama said this:

I will never forget the time eight years ago when Sasha was four months that she would not stop crying.  And she was not a crier, so we knew something was wrong.  So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning.  He examined her and same something’s wrong.  We didn’t know what.  But he told us that she could have meningitis.  So we were terrified.  He said, get to the emergency room right away.

Which the _New York Times_ [reported thus](http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/michelle-obama-health-care-overhaul-important-to-women/):

In her speech, Mrs. Obama also told the story of how her daughter Sasha would not stop crying when she was 4 months old. A doctor’s visit revealed she might have meningitis; she ultimately did not, but the illness produced a scare.

So far, so consistent: something was wrong with Sasha Obama; she was brought to a pediatrician; the pediatrician told her parents she could have meningitis and advised them to take her to the hospital.  But Morrissey is suspicious because

[i]n a speech to nurses just eight days earlier, Barack Obama told the story [quite a bit differently](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the\_press\_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Health-Insurance-Reform/) (emphasis mine):

When our youngest daughter, Sasha, was **diagnosed with meningitis** when she was just three months old, it was one of the scariest moments of my life.  And we had to have a spinal tap administered and she ended up being in the hospital for three or four days.  And it was touch and go, we didn’t know whether she’d be permanently affected by it.  It was the nurses who walked us through what was happening and made sure that Sasha was okay.

Well, she _wasn’t_ diagnosed with meningitis.  How hard is it to get the facts straight so that both Obamas tell the same story?

I know what you’re thinking: this is the kind of close-reading I advocate doing in posts [like this](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/he-may-have-said-we-need-segregated-buses-but-he-didnt-mean-it/).  Let it be known, however, that I do _not_ believe paying close attention to language is enough: the conclusions drawn from that analysis abide by the basic rules of logic and the English language. So let me help Mr. Morrissey out:


**Michelle Obama said**: So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning.  He examined her and same something’s wrong.  We didn’t know what.  But he told us that she could have meningitis.

**President Obama said:** When our youngest daughter, Sasha, was diagnosed with meningitis when she was just three months old[.]

In his fever to catch the President in a lie, Mr. Morrissey neglects to notice that Michelle Obama said that _the pediatrician diagnosed Sasha as possibly having meningitis_, at which point Sasha was taken to the hospital to have a spinal tap administered in order _to confirm the diagnosis_.  Mr. Morrissey, it seems, is just another Edmund Premington:


Like Premington, Mr. Morrissey’s problems with comprehension are based on a gross deformity—only in this case intellectual instead of bodily.  He cannot understand that when the First Lady says the pediatrician “told us that [Sasha] could have meningitis,” that constituted a _diagnosis_.  On the basis of that diagnosis, the pediatrician told them “get to the emergency room right away” where, according to the President, Sasha had “a spinal tap administered and she ended up being in the hospital for three or four days.”  Far from there being a _lie_, there isn’t even a _discrepancy_ there: you are diagnosed with Malady X, sent to the hospital for confirmation, then treated for _whatever is wrong with you_, even if it differs from the initial diagnosis.  In short, the validity of the pediatrician’s diagnosis is immaterial—the fact that it was made is all that matters..

For example, in the summer of 2004 a doctor diagnosed with me and treated for a mild case of depression.  A few months later, [my throat swelled up](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/how-sek-hid-can.html) and a different doctor diagnosed me with thyroid cancer.  In both cases, I was diagnosed.  If I say that I was diagnosed with mild depression in the summer of 2004, nothing that happened subsequently would make me a liar for stating it _because that is the way logic and the English language work_.

Either Mr. Morrissey and his commenters don’t know from logic or the English language, or they are being deliberately dense to score the cheapest of political points.  The idea, as I understand it, is to toss meat into the thin gruel of Joe Wilson’s cooking because every little bit adds some body to the soup.  However, Mr. Morrissey and his ilk care little how any individual ingredient contributes to the flavor, because no matter what anyone tosses in there, the last step of the recipe calls for adding two parts ungranulated racism for every one part of liquid:

[Fortunately Sasha recovered from meningitis so quickly that she was able to get out of her hospital bed and march with Dr. King in Selma](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/comment-page-1/#comment-2732475)[.]

[Not one to cause excitement, unless there is a good communitity organizing reason behind it, he decided not to inform Michelle of this matter](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/comment-page-1/#comment-2732485).

[At least she has slave blood running in her veins](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/comment-page-1/#comment-2732486)[.]

[They put her up in front of a totally sympathetic audience (black women) and then watch helplessly as their opponents fisk her remarks, which are exactly the same as her husband’s](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/comment-page-2/#comment-2732714).

[Fact checkers are racists conservatives and can’t be allowed to be part of the future of this country, they don’t fit with Obamas fantasies and lies so they must be marginalized or completely eliminated](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/comment-page-2/#comment-2733023).

[WTF is up with that belt. Does she not know that when she wears things like that it makes her hips and a$$ look large. Like she doesn’t have enough junk in that trunk](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/18/michelle-obama-on-obamacare-this-is-very-much-a-womens-issue/comment-page-6/#comment-2732945).”

It would have been worse, but as Mr. Morrissey’s commenters complain:

[**NET-NANNYING COMMENT THREADS ARE BORING TO READ . . .**](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/18/michelle-obama-on-obamacare-this-is-very-much-a-womens-issue/comment-page-1/#comment-2730742)

[Don’t want to get banned for what I really think](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/18/michelle-obama-on-obamacare-this-is-very-much-a-womens-issue/comment-page-1/#comment-2730818).

Even Mr. Morrissey knows that letting the racism of his compatriots trot out in response to _every and anything he writes_ might give others the correct impression about what the actual issue is here.  There’s a reason, after all, he had to write [this](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/18/a-note-about-our-comment-section/):

We welcome debate and humor, but if you use racial, ethnic, and/or animal terms to describe politicians and their families (I’m certain I don’t need to explain further), your comments will get deleted and your account closed.

Odd that he shuffles the most significant thing he says into a parenthetical, don’t you think?  But these people _are not_, I repeat, _not_ racists.  As proof, I present to you this video from the Values Voters Summit in which Tony Perkins, a supporter of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group which once posted [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20050204012636/cofcc.org/shelby.htm) [_not for the faint of heart or stomach_] on their official page, introduced Congressman Roy Blunt, who then went on to tell a joke about “eliminating the monkey problem” that _was not_, I repeat, _not_ in any way a dog-whistle:


It was _just_ a complaint about the President involving an analogy about good, decent Anglo-Saxon imperialists whose dream of having a golf course in India was being ruined by a group of unruly monkeys . . .

Dear SEK,  

I advise an even more careful reading of the quote from President Obama which clearly implies that he and Michelle were worried about whether the meningitis had caused their daughter permanent damge.   One doesn’t worry about permanent damage unless one HAS meningitis.  Please note this portion of President Obama’s quote:  

 “And we had to have a spinal tap administered and she ended up being in the hospital for three or four days.  And it was touch and go, we didn’t know whether she’d be permanently affected by it.  It was the nurses who walked us through what was happening and made sure that Sasha was okay.”  

     Permanently affected by ‘it?’ By what?  Certainly not by the spinal tap.  One knows the next day if damage has occurred from that procedure.  I think your argument is dead on the table in the OR.  President Obama, I believe, clearly intended for us to believe that his daughter had suffered meningitis and was recovering in the hospital.  

Sincerely,  

Jim Anderson

This is quite possibly the stupidest dispute ever.  What makes it even stupider is that Michelle Obama didn’t say that Sasha didn’t have meningitis, the New York Times did.  Here is what Mrs. Obama said:  [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the\_press\_office/Remarks-by-the-First-Lady-on-What-Health-Insurance-Reform-Means-for-Women-and-Families/](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the\_press\_office/Remarks-by-the-First-Lady-on-What-Health-Insurance-Reform-Means-for-Women-and-Families/).

Clearly, we need the Obamas to release Sasha’s records so we can get to the bottom of this!  Also, was she 3 months old or 4 months old?  Why can’t they get their stories straight?

I’m going to crosspost my comment from Acephalous:

First, I want to emphasize what you said about that Council of Conservative Citizens link: That ranks with the most gut-wrenchingly racist and shocking things I’ve ever seen. Do NOT click it unless you’re prepared for something both physically and psychically disgusting.

Second, I thought the comment thread after Morissey’s cautionary post was fascinating for the vitriol directed at Little Green Footballs and its proprietor Charles Johnson. Apparently the racist stuff is their fault, though why LGF would want to, or even think to, sabotage Hot Air comment threads by making HA look bad to liberals is unclear to me. LGF trolls are apparently worse than leftist ones, though there were a few swats at purported liberal sock-puppet trollery (though, since they apparently consider LGF to be a leftist site now, it’s not clear they weren’t still talking about LGF).

Finally, though Morissey issued his caution, none of the comments you linked to have been removed at this point.

_One doesn’t worry about permanent damage unless one HAS meningitis._

Oh, come on: the child was in the hospital for days with a high fever. One who has children _always_ worries about permanent damage in the case of a serious illness, whether or not it’s been correctly diagnosed. I don’t know what the timeline is for a meningitis diagnosis, thanks be to god, but there are two possibilities: it’s positive, which is terrifying; it’s negative, which means _you still don’t know what’s wrong with your seriously ill child_, which is devastating.

Jim Anderson:

_Permanently affected by ‘it?’_

That would be the meningitis her pediatrician had diagnosed her as having.  Turns out the pediatrician was wrong, but that can only be determined by a spinal tap, which—here’s a bit I didn’t include, but which is now relevant:

To Morrissey’s commenters who say things like [this](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/19/obama-fudging-another-health-care-horror-story/comment-page-2/#comment-2732646):

A diagnosis of meningitis followed by 3 or 4 days of treatment versus a diagnosis that she didn’t have meningitis. Classic leftist non-think.

My only response is that Sasha was born in 2001, at which time she had a spinal tap because the Xpert EV test, the results of which are delivered “[in less than two and a half hours compared to up to three days for standard culture testing](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/65556.php) [of cerebrospinal fluid],” was not approved by the FDA until 2007.  This commenter seems to think that the best course of treatment for a baby suspected of having meningitis while waiting for the results from the standard culture testing—the “three or four days in the hospital” mentioned by the President—would be to do nothing in the interim.

The worrying they were doing, about the permanent damage?  It took place _in the interim_, while the future President and First Lady were waiting for the results of the spinal tap.  

Put differently: if you had a child who’d undergone a painful, dangerous test for a potentially lethal disease and was still very, very sick, would you fret at all while you waited for the test results to return?  If not, I think that’d make you an historically awful parent.

The use of a spinal tap to rule out meningitis is a standard procedure for young children with high fever. No qualified doctor will make a real diagnosis of meningitis before this test is performed. I understand the fear and worry that accompanies this procedure having gone through it with my daughter. I’m not going to say that Obama lied but he twisted the facts around to make the point that he wanted.

**[Gary Farber](http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com)**

					

		

Curiously enough, I was highly ill for a number of months in early 1986, and I went through a series of tentative diagnoses as I proceeded from test to test, and specialist to specialist.

One of them was — and here’s what’s _really crazy_, which is that these were just _tentative opinions_ by doctors of what _might_ be wrong with me, with _further_ determinations being made by _continuing the process of testing and refining a diagnosis_ until eventually a _conclusive determination_ and _final diagnosis_ could be made — was — hold your breath everyone!  — possible viral meningitis.

And one of the tests I had was a spinal tap!

Which, not incidentally, I had a somewhat atypical response to, of the sort that only about 3%!o(MISSING)f subjects of a spinal tap have, which is that I got to lie about in extreme pain for three days in more or less a non-stop back spasm afterwards; I was so loaded with pain-killers to treat this that I drifted in and out of consciousness for three days.

Eventually, after _months_ of further testing, it turned out I didn’t have meningitis!  Or any of a series of other life-threatening ailments that doctors had temporarily thought I _might possibly have_.

But apparently I never should have been worried at all.

Good to know.

The better half and I have a little girl who is now 7; she came along sort of late in life for both of us, to the “advanced maternal age” point…not surprisingly, various and sundry tests and bed rest for two months prior to delivery were the directives, and we followed through. 

 At one point in the second trimester, there was a considerd opinion (diagnosis?) from a qualified medical professional that she would not be born healthy and we consider ending the pregnancy. For a variety of reasons, we sought out a second opinion and another qualified medical professional suggested otherwise. After she was born, she needed two operations, and there are few things that tears one up more than handing an infant over for surgery.

 All that being said, today she is a very happy, healthy, and smart 2nd-grader, who we are thankful for every day of our lives.

 Now, if I were to relate that story as part of making a larger point about, oh, I dunno, various and sundry public policy intersections with private life, but I happened to state something that did not gibe with an audience members’ understanding (“hey, you got THREE opinions!” or “It was the FIRST trimester!” or “the bed rest was only for six weeks, not two months”) I, personally, would tell said audience member they might want to look up the definitions of forests and trees…

 And then I would go and hug my daughter.

I considered comment on that, but decided not to interject myself in someone’s family dynamics.

But since you mention it again, I’ll say that in some nine years of reading blogs, I’ve never befre seen anyone write “MY MOTHER, THE TROLL.”

“I’m not sure where this fits in the annals of odd, but it’s got to be somewhere.”

Don’t you have a therapist who is also your Facebook Friend?

More helpfully, my opinion is that you’ve got a great pitch for a sitcom in those four words.

They put “[My Mother, The Car](http://www.tvparty.com/recmothercar.html)” on the air, you know, and I’ve always wanted to hear a tape of how _that_ pitch meeting went.

I’m thinking maybe Fran Drescher in the role of the mother.

_I’m waiting for someone’s sister to be accused of being a thespian…_

Well, SEK is a confirmed pedagogue. It wouldn’t surprise if there was some thespianism in the family.

Is that better or worse than being a classicist?

Worse, in Fresno. Definitely.

 I don’t think it’s a probblem in Irvine, though…

Be careful with words like pedagogue; seriously, that stuff’ll get you lynched.

_No qualified doctor will make a real diagnosis of meningitis before this test is performed._ 

Oh, good lord.  The story is being told by Sasha’s PARENTS.  Are you a parent?  Do you understand parenting at all?

DOCTOR:  “Better take Sasha to the hospital for some tests, as it’s possible she has meningitis.”

PARENT _(thinking)_:  Omigod my kid has meningitis!

To the doctor, it’s a hypothesis to be tested; to the non-M.D. parent, it’s a fucking diagnosis.

Besides the standard contortions of language we’ve come to expect, these folks have the medical issues all fouled-up, too. I’m a pediatric intensive care doc, and the Obama child’s experience is absolutely standard. Infants of that age with fevers are usually presumed to have possible meningitis until proven otherwise. The proving otherwise takes several days — the spinal fluid culture has to incubate in the laboratory to see if any bacteria grow. Yes, the immediate results of the spinal fluid analysis (cell counts and chemistry) are very helpful (and reassuring if normal), but it takes several days to be sure. Meanwhile, the child is treated with antibiotics. It’s all very ordinary.

The Obama statements, both his and hers, are unremarkable. Unfortunately, so are those of the wingers. Standard, absurd stuff.

Wai, wai, wai wai waitaminute!!! There’s perfidy here, and you all haven’t fathomed the half of it. How about some close reading…Michelle doesn’t say “He examined her and said something’s wrong” – she says “He examined her and same something’s wrong” -see for yourself, it’s in the White House transcript [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the\_press\_office/Remarks-by-the-First-Lady-on-What-Health-Insurance-Reform-Means-for-Women-and-Families/](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the\_press\_office/Remarks-by-the-First-Lady-on-What-Health-Insurance-Reform-Means-for-Women-and-Families/) – and accurately cited by JammieWearingFool,  HotAir, Acephalous, and Edge of the American West (this blog), but seemingly not noticed that telling detail. What do you think Michelle could mean by “same something’s wrong” – a slip of the tongue perhaps, demonstrating that she’s already thinking about how vital it is that her hubby tell the SAME lie? Or perhaps even a coded message telling him to do so. Believe me, this couple will stop at nothing.
