Michelle Malkin’s [vaunted list](http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/04/who-says-conservative-bloggers-dont-do-reporting/) of “investigative online reporting published on conservative blogs” demonstrates, for the umpteenth time, that Michelle Malkin can’t tell the difference between reporters and partisan political operatives.  She opens the list reportly enough—Patterico’s posts on [William Jefferson](http://patterico.com/2008/05/28/revealed-exclusive-new-details-regarding-different-allegations-of-bribery-of-us-rep-william-jefferson/), [Alex](http://patterico.com/2008/06/11/kozinskis-porn-stash-revealed/) [Kozinski](http://patterico.com/2008/06/11/the-la-timess-tipster-on-kozinskis-porn-cyrus-sanai/) and [Chuck](http://patterico.com/2008/11/23/chuck-philipss-letters-to-a-witness-merely-suggestive-or-witness-tampering/) [Philips](http://patterico.com/2008/03/27/a-tale-of-two-recanters-and-their-friend-la-times-%!e(MISSING)2%9cinvestigative%!e(MISSING)2%9d-reporter-chuck-philips-part-one-by-guest-blogger-wls/) are, in fact, works of investigative journalism—but after that you have:

1.  a [hit-piece](http://michellemalkin.com/2005/09/27/where-in-the-world-63/) on Air America
2.  a [hit-piece](http://www.minnesotademocratsexposed.com/index.php) on Al Franken
3.  an [unpublished hit-piece](http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-op-ed-the-new-york-times-wouldnt-run/) by Larry Grathwohl that [Confederate Yankee](http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/) posted because neither knew the _New York Times_ doesn’t print op-ed rebuttals
4.  [something or other](http://rsmccain.blogspot.com/2009/01/yglesias-right-and-wrong.html) in which someone talks about attending political rallies
5.  a hit-piece on Ayers in which one “Zombie” [did a Lexis-Nexis search](http://www.zombietime.com/zomblog/?p=64)
6.  numerous failed hit-pieces by Charles Johnson—[representative](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/30241\_At\_the\_Official\_Obama\_Site-\_How\_the\_Jewish\_Lobby\_Works)—about trolls on Obama’s community blogs
7.  a [hit-piece](http://www.bizzyblog.com/2008/03/17/tuccs-church-bulletins-from-july-2007-probably-make-whether-obama-was-present-on-july-22-irrelevant/) on Jeremiah Wright
8.  a [hit-piece](http://gregransom.com/prestopundit/2008/04/gregs-guide-to-barack-obamas-d.html) on Obama Jr. via Obama Sr.
9.  numerous hit-pieces by Stanley Kurtz—[representative](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTgwZTVmN2QyNzk2MmUxMzA5OTg0ODZlM2Y2OGI0NDM=)—on Obama
10.  numerous hit-pieces on Obama for his “abortion extremism” in which his public voting record and campaign statements were “reported on”
11.  some “[top notch investigative work](http://michellemalkin.com/?s=palestra)” that links to back to Malkin’s post
12.  some video hit-pieces [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iivL4c\_3pck&feature=channel) that rebroadcast Obama’s never-before-heard and never-anywhere-seen statements about “redistributing wealth”
13.  a [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=ed+morrissey+adscam&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) for Ed Morrissey at Hot Air that “brought down [Canada’s] liberal government in 2005
14.  a whole slew of hit-pieces written by Malkin herself which I won’t bother to link to

My point?

Doing a Lexis-Nexis search _is not investigative reporting_.

Reprinting material from social networking sites _is not investigative reporting_.

Rebroadcasting clips that every network—including Foxnews—had in heavy rotation for weeks on end _is not investigative reporting_.

Attacking people with whom a Presidential candidate had some contact _is not investigative reporting_.

While it’s possible for partisan hacks like Malkin to do investigative reporting, little of what she presents _as_ investigative reporting _is_ investigative reporting.   The majority of her links are to undisguised attacks by unpaid political operatives, and—say it with me now—an undisguised attack by an unpaid political operative _is not investigative reporting_.

The comments on Matt Y’s blog hit on some key points.  Modern conservatism is about ideology.  Journalism is about getting after the truth.  What do you get from the right except lies, followed by lies about their lies?  They lie because the truth does not suit their purposes.  That’s why I say reality has a liberal bias.

I heard somewhere that the vast majority of reporters vote Democratic.  Could it be that reporters, economists, humanities professors – those who spend their professional lives attempting to understand the interaction between people and the world – tend to be liberal because they have some understanding of reality?

BTW, SEK, excellent investigative reporting in this post!

Well, Scott, Michelle Malkin’s list of “investigative reporting” is pretty thin, and pretty pathetic (just like Michelle Malkin) – but the saddest thing here is that she – and worse, a nontrivial number of her readers an/or sympathizers actually think that crap like this IS “investigative reporting” – or its equivalent.

_Pace_ jazzbumpa above, I don’t think the issue here is about “truth” or “lies” per se – regardless of the facts – but about ideology and opinion. And about getting the “correct” opinion “published” and on the record, even if only as a sputtering refutation of somebody else’s “wrong” opinion (better, since it requires no original thought). And is symptomatic of the contemporary Right’s intellectual sterility.

[…] At Edge of the American West, SEK does a more thorough job of fisking Malkin’s examples. It occurs to me that another benefit of institutional support is editorial oversight – journalistic […]

Jay –  

With the right, ideology and lies are equivalent, and ideology consistently trumps reality.  Their ideology is based on supply-side economics, which is a sham; free trade, which is a sham; the idea that tax cuts benefit working people, business, and the economy in general, which is a sham; American exceptionalism, which is a sham; the idea that “government is the problem”, which is a sham.  Then you get into specific policy lies like WMD or the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression, and assaults on the Constitution with signing statements, FISA violations, Patriot Act, etc.

Overlay all of that with stark incompetence, stunning arrogance, and intolerance for criticism.

It’s dark underbelly is racist, elitist, divisive, and authoritarian.  

An investigative journalist, unless driven by a pro-administration agenda, is eventually going to encounter some of this.  Then it has to be either reported or suppressed.  

Investigative journalism and right-wingery have this fundamental incompatibility.

It’s often said that reality has a liberal bias, but I think the truth is actually the reverse.  Liberals[1] have a reality bias – if their theories are contradicted by reality, they \*change their theories\*.  That’s why they’re (ok, we’re) called the reality-based community.

Conservatives[2] don’t behave like this.  If they find evidence from reality that contradicts their ideas, they find a way to discredit the evidence – “that’s just what the liberals want you to believe”, for example.  Changing your mind based on evidence is “flip-flopping” – a cowardly act if genuine, and a sinister one if feigned.  Since conservatives and their ideas are inseparable, an attack on one is an attack on the other – argument isn’t an attempt to convince someone to change their minds (nobody does that), it’s a struggle for dominance to determine whose ideas are put into practice.

That’s why disagreement is treason – arguing that the leader is mistaken \*actually stops him from carrying out his plan\*, which would have worked fine without the naysayers.  Predicting a negative outcome is synonymous with causing it, thus the emphasis on the power of positive thinking.  It’s not just the Green Lantern approach to foreign policy; it’s the Green Lantern approach to \*everything, all the time\*.  The universe is either carrying out your will, or someone else’s, so you’d better make sure it’s yours.

Since (good) journalism is about finding out something about reality and reporting it to an audience \*that didn’t already know it\*, it follows that conservatives neither particularly value it, nor are much good at it.  Their preferred method of narrative reinforces already-held conservative beliefs; evidence is optional, and only acceptable to the extent it doesn’t get in the way of reinforcing conservative ideas.  Competing theories exist only to be vilified.

[1] Actually, only certain liberals do this – liberalism is a diverse group that values diversity, not a uniform group that values conformity.  There’s plenty of unreality-based liberalism around.  But people who are serious about getting things done in the universe tend to look for approaches that get results – i.e., the reality-based ones.

[2] By which I mean Americans who self-identify as conservative, i.e., largely authoritarians.  John Dean notwithstanding, and regardless of whether that usage is consistent with historical usages or not, that’s what conservatism actually means in modern America.
