## Dear John Carlos Rowe: SHUT UP!

Some of us don’t have tenure yet.  This is completely uncalled for:

In _Connecticut Yankee_, Twain warns the reader that the United States is already following the lead of the European imperial powers, a message he would repeat with growing volubility in his anti-imperialist writings from 1898 to 1905, **_most of which require little interpretation_**.  ([_Literary Culture and U.S. Imperialism_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195131509/diesekoschmar-20), 139, emphasis mine.)

You are an evil liar, John Carlos Rowe.  You may have total recall.  You may be right charming.  I may even respect you mightily.  That changes nothing.  This is beyond the pale.  Don’t believe me?  Ask anyone without tenure and brace yourself for a brutal what for.  Fact:

_**Everything**_ requires_ **loads**_ of interpretation.  _**All of it**_.  (_**Even that**_.)

Just because you have tenure doesn’t mean you can give up the gig.  Some of us still have to slog through six sets a night.

Hi SEK’s mom!  (Wait, do I have to go to your site to say hello to her?  I have trouble with written English and basic reasoning in any language.)

Twain wrote in English.  Why would he need interpretation?

What are you complaining about, SEK?

Rowe just provided you with an untenured-person’s dream: something tendentious said by someone with tenure, thus providing you with an opportunity to play king-of-the-hill.

But I suppose this post suggests you’ve figured that out for yourself….

I like how the [very next sentence](http://books.google.com/books?id=LMNh51Iu5cQC&pg=PA139&vq=volubility&dq=John+Carlos+Rowe&psp=1&source=gbs\_search\_r&cad=1\_1&sig=ZlCtIE68hesd6g\_x3Niu8ulNacU) begins, “Twain did not understand, however, what he had himself written….”  Very explicitly: interpretation for me but not for thee.

Besides, this was published 8 years ago!  Has that slowed anyone down?  

Besides, if not interpretation, there’s always context.  You are a historicist, after all.

Twain didn’t know what he had authored? Wow.  And here all this time I thought he was one of ourbest writers and thinkers.  Hmmm.  I guess I’ll just have to revise that opinion.

SEK, you should set your mom up with a Google Reader account pre-loaded with all of the Kaufman blogging goodness she can handle. This is how I handled my wife’s blog-following laziness. Now she sees posts before I do.

He was an excellent writer, but he couldn’t read for shit.  I thought everyone knew this.

In fairness (?) to Rowe, I should say that I don’t think he really means what he’s written here, either in the phrase that got Scott’s goat or the one I quoted.  No doubt if you asked him, he would be able to translate them into more carefully qualified form (“Twain’s anti-imperialist writings are mostly straightforward _[in some particular sense]_….yet they don’t take account of certain contemporary cultural changes which Twain remarked on them in other contexts…”).  He’s careless, seemingly writing in haste.

Just like me!  (“…which Twain remarked on 
them
…”)

Shut up indeed! One might noodle him up in one’s capacious memory banks with John Rawls and John Crowe Ransom and other illustrious folk then where would one be?  _“…considered one of the most eminent and progressive critics of American literature, has in recent years become instrumental in shaping the path of American studies…”_  The things one can learn with too much time on one’s hands.  To paraphrase that great Americanist, Rodney Dangerfield, interpretation for everyone!
