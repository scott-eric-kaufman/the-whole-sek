## Dear John Carlos Rowe: SHUT UP!

Some of us don’t have tenure yet.  This is completely uncalled for:

In _Connecticut Yankee_, Twain warns the reader that the United States is already following the lead of the European imperial powers, a message he would repeat with growing volubility in his anti-imperialist writings from 1898 to 1905, **_most of which require little interpretation_**.  ([_Literary Culture and U.S. Imperialism_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195131509/diesekoschmar-20), 139, emphasis mine.)

You are an evil liar, John Carlos Rowe.  You may have total recall.  You may be right charming.  I may even respect you mightily.  That changes nothing.  This is beyond the pale.  Don’t believe me?  Ask anyone without tenure and brace yourself for a brutal what for.  Fact:

_**Everything**_ requires_ **loads**_ of interpretation.  _**All of it**_.  (_**Even that**_.)

Just because you have tenure doesn’t mean you can give up the gig.  Some of us still have to slog through six sets a night.
