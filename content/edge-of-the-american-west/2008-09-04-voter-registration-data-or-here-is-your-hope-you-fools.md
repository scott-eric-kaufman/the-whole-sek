_**UPDATED** by Eric to say:  See the information in tabular form [here](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/change-in-voter-registration/)._

Eric’s [comment](https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/community-organizersucker/#comment-19152) got me thinking about the effect new voter registration would have on the upcoming election.  I looked high and low for some hard numbers but found none.  So, being the “citizen journalist” I am, I scoured the internet and crunched them myself.

All the information comes from the states themselves.  I’ve noted the period of time the numbers cover (as the data varies between states) as well as any circumstances preventing me from drawing firm conclusions.  If you’re able to locate any of the data that eluded me, drop a note in the comments and I’ll add it to the list.

If you don’t feel like digging through the numbers, here’s the short answer: if I were a Republican, I’d be very, very worried.

(_Title updated to reflect the awesomeness of information contain within the post._)

(_Many silent updates, but I thought I’d note this one: Alaska’s the first and, so far, only state in which mores Republican have registered than Democrats._)
