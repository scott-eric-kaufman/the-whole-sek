## Combobulated: Being a Play in Which We Laugh at Arrogant Undergraduates

(_In a small classrroom, a young professor is discussing an [R.P. Blackmur essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001JL0BVW/diesekoschmar-20) with a group of twelve or so students._)

**TEACHER:** Blackmur claims “the hues attract, draw, _steal_ men’s eyes, but penetrate, discombobolate, _amaze_ the souls or psyches of women.”  What does he mean by that?

**CLASS:** …?

**TEACHER:** Break his sentence down.  What does “discombobulate” mean?

**STUDENT #1:** Bored?

**TEACHER:** So Shakespeare’s language penetrates the souls of women by boring them?  (_two engineering majors giggle_)  How do you amaze someone by boring them?

**STUDENT #2:** (_confidently_)  It’s a technical term from Switzerland.  Watchmakers call the tiny gears inside a watch “bobulates” (_beaming_) and what a watchmaker does is he brings the bobulates together, and “com” is the Latin for “together.”  So the proper technical term for this watch here (_points to his wrist_), or any working watch, is to say it’s “combobulated.”  But over the life of a watch, it gets knocked around, and the gears get unaligned, and when that happens the watch becomes “discombobulated.”

**TEACHER:** Not “disbobulated”?

**STUDENT #2:** That’s what I said, but he told me–

**TEACHER:** He who?

**STUDENT #2:** My rabbi.

**TEACHER:** I see.

**STUDENT #2:** He said the Swiss wouldn’t be taken seriously if they didn’t keep the Latin in there, because “bobulate” sounds silly enough without the Latin prefix.

**TEACHER:** Isn’t “dis” a Latin prefix?

**STUDENT #2:** I didn’t know that then.

**TEACHER:** So what do you think Blackmur meant?

**STUDENT #2:** …?

I still don’t know what Blackmur meant—nor why my rabbi conspired with The Future to punk me—but as the MLA approaches, I’m increasingly convinced that the first time I ever spoke up in class foreshadowed some ominous end to my academic career.\*  So while I’m not exactly sure what end this start augurs, I take comfort in the fact that Dickens didn’t know what he’d foreshadowed for Pip when he wrote the first installment of _Great Expectations_.\*\*  (Or he wouldn’t have written [two endings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Expectations#The\_ending).)

The other lesson?  Never trust the Jews.

Not that scholars have written much about this.  The only exception I can think of is [about] (http://books.google.com/books?id=IFWnCdWieOcC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=foreshadowing+serial+literature&source=web&ots=7IRHHNYG9S&sig=dldjtUWeI2yueX0ZvG5qeYBhVEc)_[Buffy](http://books.google.com/books?id=IFWnCdWieOcC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=foreshadowing+serial+literature&source=web&ots=7IRHHNYG9S&sig=dldjtUWeI2yueX0ZvG5qeYBhVEc)—_but that might be because I only dipped my toe in Dickensian waters.  (Work on Wharton’s serialized novels focuses on how she altered the plot or how she mimicked James, so even though I should’ve encountered something about it researching my Wharton chapter, I didn’t.)

“Disbobulated” would describe a watch that had lost its bobulates. If the bobulates are merely out of sync, i.e., not together, the watch is discombobulated. I don’t understand the problem.

Random observation: the story of your rabbi leading you astray reminds me of my father and the story of my ENTIRE elementary and secondary education.  My father, a good Indian immigrant with aspirations for his son to become important, checked my homework every night (it was required to be completed by 8PM, at which point “free study” was allowed).  I still recall a worksheet from first grade on contractions.  The left column listed a series of modals with “not”, “can not,” “do not, “will not,” etc.  The right column was to be filled out by the student with the appropriate contraction, “can’t,” “don’t,” “won’t,” etc.  All of which I had down and filled out.  Only to be corrected by my father, the product of a proper colonial British education, “You may use such contractions verbally, but never in writing.”  I was thus asked to go back and rewrite “can not” –&gt; “cannot,” “do not” –&gt; “do not,” “will not” –&gt; “will not.”  The teacher was dumbfounded and marked me down, despite my protests.

Later teachers were similarly confused by my usage of words like amidst, amongst, and whilst, not to mention the fact that most of my papers (some snuck by Pops) pushed the punctuation outside of the inverted commas, as they were called in my home.
