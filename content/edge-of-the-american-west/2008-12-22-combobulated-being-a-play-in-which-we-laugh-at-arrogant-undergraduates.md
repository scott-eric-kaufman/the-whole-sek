(_In a small classrroom, a young professor is discussing an [R.P. Blackmur essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001JL0BVW/diesekoschmar-20) with a group of twelve or so students._)

**TEACHER:** Blackmur claims “the hues attract, draw, _steal_ men’s eyes, but penetrate, discombobolate, _amaze_ the souls or psyches of women.”  What does he mean by that?

**CLASS:** …?

**TEACHER:** Break his sentence down.  What does “discombobulate” mean?

**STUDENT #1:** Bored?

**TEACHER:** So Shakespeare’s language penetrates the souls of women by boring them?  (_two engineering majors giggle_)  How do you amaze someone by boring them?

**STUDENT #2:** (_confidently_)  It’s a technical term from Switzerland.  Watchmakers call the tiny gears inside a watch “bobulates” (_beaming_) and what a watchmaker does is he brings the bobulates together, and “com” is the Latin for “together.”  So the proper technical term for this watch here (_points to his wrist_), or any working watch, is to say it’s “combobulated.”  But over the life of a watch, it gets knocked around, and the gears get unaligned, and when that happens the watch becomes “discombobulated.”

**TEACHER:** Not “disbobulated”?

**STUDENT #2:** That’s what I said, but he told me–

**TEACHER:** He who?

**STUDENT #2:** My rabbi.

**TEACHER:** I see.

**STUDENT #2:** He said the Swiss wouldn’t be taken seriously if they didn’t keep the Latin in there, because “bobulate” sounds silly enough without the Latin prefix.

**TEACHER:** Isn’t “dis” a Latin prefix?

**STUDENT #2:** I didn’t know that then.

**TEACHER:** So what do you think Blackmur meant?

**STUDENT #2:** …?

I still don’t know what Blackmur meant—nor why my rabbi conspired with The Future to punk me—but as the MLA approaches, I’m increasingly convinced that the first time I ever spoke up in class foreshadowed some ominous end to my academic career.\*  So while I’m not exactly sure what end this start augurs, I take comfort in the fact that Dickens didn’t know what he’d foreshadowed for Pip when he wrote the first installment of _Great Expectations_.\*\*  (Or he wouldn’t have written [two endings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Expectations#The\_ending).)

The other lesson?  Never trust the Jews.

Not that scholars have written much about this.  The only exception I can think of is [about] (http://books.google.com/books?id=IFWnCdWieOcC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=foreshadowing+serial+literature&source=web&ots=7IRHHNYG9S&sig=dldjtUWeI2yueX0ZvG5qeYBhVEc)_[Buffy](http://books.google.com/books?id=IFWnCdWieOcC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=foreshadowing+serial+literature&source=web&ots=7IRHHNYG9S&sig=dldjtUWeI2yueX0ZvG5qeYBhVEc)—_but that might be because I only dipped my toe in Dickensian waters.  (Work on Wharton’s serialized novels focuses on how she altered the plot or how she mimicked James, so even though I should’ve encountered something about it researching my Wharton chapter, I didn’t.)
