Just ask Sen. McCain, who tonight said:

Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.

We _could_ give him the benefit of the doubt, but what incentive do we have to do so?  I mean, Obama can’t speak without st–st–stuttering were it not for his tele–tele–(_the gag’s done gassed_)–prompter.

However, if we were in McCain’s camp, this would be proof positive that Ayers was the tip of the terrorist iceberg.
