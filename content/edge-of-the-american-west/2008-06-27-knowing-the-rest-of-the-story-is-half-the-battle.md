## Knowing the rest of the story is half the battle

The reason I’m an historicist instead of an historian—besides the obvious, like being in an English department—is because I’m a bit of a romantic when it comes to my history.  For example, to appropriate a line from (of all things) [_Elizabethtown_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000CNESJO/diesekoschmar-20), I’m a connoisseur of first looks.  When, I ask myself, did this figure of future historical significance first enter the national consciousness?  Who, for example, is buried in this paragraph from the 30 July 1967 edition of the _LA Times_?

The flames quickly spread to the hangar deck … setting off bombs, rockets and other ordnance, while touching off many jet planes, all of which were fully loaded with fuel and heavily laden with ordnance.

You can almost picture him in one of the “many jet planes,” “bombs, rockets, and other ordnance” exploding around him; but as of 30 July he has no name, no face.  For the moment, this anonymous pilot sits alone, as yet undisturbed by history, on the burning pitch of an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Tonkin Gulf.

The next day, the _New York Times_ provided a fuller, albeit tentative, account of the fire that took the lives of more than 130 US sailors:

For some unknown reason, a plane parked near the carrier’s island, midway up the 1,045-foot flight deck, experienced an “extreme wet start.”  This malfunction, comparable to what happens when a cigarette lighter is ignited after having been filled too full, occurs about once a week on attack carriers, but almsot never so severely as as it did yesterday.

A thick tongue of flame lashed backward from the parked jet, igniting a missile on one of the dozen or so planes parked near the fantail, their engines turning over in readiness for a strike launching scheduled for 11 A.M.

The rocket “shot across the deck,” Captain Beling said, “and by a quirk of fate smashed into a fuel tank under a plane on the port side.”

No one aboard the Forrestal seemed to know today which plane the missile had hit — but it was probably either the Skyhawk whose cockpit was occupied by Lieut. Comdr. John S. McCain 3d or the one immediately to his right.

He is become historical, mentioned by name in the paper of record.

Not that this is the first time his name has appeared, as the father and grandfather with whom he shares it appear regularly in Vietnam and WWII reportage; but this is our first glimpse of the man who will lose to Obama in November—alone, almost exploded, surrounded by the agonized screams of the likely dead.

What can I say?  I’m like Paul Harvey.  (Only macabre.)

Perhaps at some point you could give us an Arthur Lovejoy-ish taxonomy, such as “13 Varieties of Historicism,” or some such?  Only shorter, of course.  I once tried to trace the history of the New Historicism back thru its various foreshadowings and such, but it gave me a headache.

Obama’s NYT’s “moment”- February 6, 1990- “First Black Elected to Head Harvard’s Law Review”

Let’s compare their entry into the “record”- being elected to one of the most prestigious law reviews and breaking down barriers in the act vs. almost being blown to bits in an unfortunate naval accident.

Wouldn’t that be [Stevensian](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stevens-13ways.html)?  No matter.  I’m saddened, however, that you didn’t click every single one of my links on my first post here, because I’ve already done [_exactly what you’ve asked of me_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/today\_seems\_to\_.html), nutshell and all.

urbino:

_Good day._

Didn’t happen today!  In this respect, I’m not the best today-in-history blogger.  

**BUT!**

I miss many other deadlines likewise, so this should surprise no one.

Pete:

1.  Your blog looks incredible.  Thanks for commenting and bringing it to my attention.

2.  This is a wee unfair:

_Let’s compare their entry into the “record”- being elected to one of the most prestigious law reviews and breaking down barriers in the act vs. almost being blown to bits in an unfortunate naval accident._

I’m no fan of McCain, but I’ll begrudge him the horrible luck he’s had.  I mean, it’s not his fault he happened to be in queue when someone else dropped something explosive.

The scene that passage paints makes me think that in a biopic of McCain, the best possible leading man might be Leslie Nielsen.

No matter how old he is when the project starts.

That looks useful!  But wouldn’t or shouldn’t David Reynolds’ Whitman book, as well as Beneath the American Renaissance, be up there beside AD’s TH?

I liked it too, and the Whitman too.  But what did you “hate” about JB?  Did you agree with Wilentz’s review?

_Didn’t happen today! In this respect, I’m not the best today-in-history blogger._

Dude, I was just playing along with the Paul Harvey shtick.

_I mean, it’s not his fault he happened to be in queue when someone else dropped something explosive._

True story: as I was reading that report, I was sure it would finish by telling us the pilot of the “extremely wet start” jet was young George W. Bush of the Texas Air National Guard.  Then it turned out to be about McCain, and I realized it was a silly thought in the first place.  The Tonkin Gulf is **much** too close to Vietnam.

True story.

My inner historian of material culture immediately noticed this:

This malfunction, comparable to what happens when a cigarette lighter is ignited after having been filled too full….

No doubt in 1967, this analogy would have been entirely familiar, but between the decline in smoking and the rise of the Bic® disposable lighter ([introduced in 1973](http://www.flickyourbic.com/timeline.cfm)) it would soon become much more obscure to most Americans.

_Damn Irish sociologists with their aspirated aitches._

Irish orthography is filled with sequences of silent letters, so when we get the chance to pronounce them in English, we do. 

Writing “an historian” or “an historic event” brings to mind Eliza Doolittle — “I am of an archival bent / I will study an ‘istoric event / An ‘istory buff is wot I’ll be / Oh wooooooouldn’t it be luverly.”

SEK:  

1. Thanks!

_I’m no fan of McCain, but I’ll begrudge him the horrible luck he’s had. I mean, it’s not his fault he happened to be in queue when someone else dropped something explosive._

2. Of course you can’t place a whole lot of historical meaning on the events which precipitated mention in the Times and their fitness to be President. I just found it interesting/amusing that Obama’s first mention- first African American President of the Harvard Law Review, is something in his oft mentioned “bio” whereas McCain’s was a freak accident of history.
