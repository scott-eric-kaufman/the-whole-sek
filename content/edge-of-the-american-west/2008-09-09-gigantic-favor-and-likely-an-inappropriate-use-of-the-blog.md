## Gigantic favor (and likely an inappropriate use of the blog)

(_This post will self-destruct shortly._)

Will some generous soul read over my Twain chapter for 1) typos and 2) egregiously stupid statements?\*  I wouldn’t ask, but I have to turn this thing in on Wednesday and have the editorial near-sightedness which comes from being too close to a text.  The chapter is barely this side of awful—fitful pacing, signposts everywhere, ghastly prose—but at this point I’m more worried about done than good.\*\*  I’m trying [to avoid this is all](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/i-seem-to-be-ou.html).

.  I found me a _mensch_.  If you would like to read it, send me an email.

\*Cut-and-paste errors mostly: lack of transitions, re-introducing something already introduced, not introducing something I seem to be referring back to, &c.

\*\*That’s not false humility.  The chapter is truly awful for reasons which I could (and will in the future) describe.  But it is not good.  Nor is it representative of my work generally.  (In conception, maybe, but not in execution.)

I’d love to help, but I’m trying to rid my own chapter of the same problems.   Suggestion to slow down your brain so you can edit:  read the page backward through the reverse side.  It lets you see what is there.

Good luck!

This is a fine sales job you’ve done here, SEK.  I’m stunned that people aren’t clamoring to read a chapter that’s “barely this side of awful—fitful pacing, signposts everywhere, ghastly prose”.  You should consider Amway if the academy doesn’t work out.

You know, a _mensch_ out there — who will be publicly recognized if s/he so desires — is reading it.  I thought about the sale’s pitch, but then decided, no matter what I say, people will chalk it up to false humility.  It isn’t.  (And hey!  Now you can sort of see what my work is like!  Only don’t!  Because this ain’t representative.)

Someone agreed already?  Vance is such a sucker.  He should learn to be more of a maverick.

You didn’t just ask me straight off?

Ha!  It’s not Vance this time.  (Although he gets a shout out in my acknowledgments for his _mensch_-work on my Mitchell and Wharton chapter.)  

And not just one, but four people agreed.  (Even a big-name conservative blogger, but not the one I linked to today, a different one.)

_You didn’t just ask me straight off?_

Would you like to read it?  I can send it your way.  To be honest, you’d be like the prose equivalent of my advisor, which would be sort of awesome.

I’d have offered, but I guess I’m too slow. I actually kinda like proofreading–a function of being reasonably good at it yet only having it constitute a small part of my working day. If I were a proper proofreader, I suppose I’d have worked up a proper hatred for it.  

Good luck!

I’ll take a look at it, sure. As long as it’s in English, it’ll be easier than what I’m currently reading.
