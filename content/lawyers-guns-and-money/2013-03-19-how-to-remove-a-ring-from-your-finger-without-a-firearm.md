Now pony up the $35 it costs for the jeweler to repair it, and resume plucking the hairs from your beard one at a time. If your wife complains, remind her of what happened the last time. If she insists on reminding you about your [mother’s favorite story](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78713952)—about the time you got your head stuck in a toilet seat and the rescue squad had to be called in, and since your father drove an ambulance with that very squad, all the paramedics knew you and teased you  as they used the [jaws of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\_rescue\_tools) to extricate your head,[[\*]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78751680) and did your mother mention she has a picture of you bawling, the toilet seat around your head, which she took while she waited for the paramedics to arrive, because she does and it is around here somewhere—if she insists on reminding you of that, turn up the television and pretend you can’t hear her, because you can’t win this one.
