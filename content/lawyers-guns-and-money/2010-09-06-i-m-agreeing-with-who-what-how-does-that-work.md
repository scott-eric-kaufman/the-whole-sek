I have quite a bit to say about last night's extraordinary episode of _Mad Men_, "The Suitcase," but am pressed for the time at the moment (in part because I'm putting the finishing touches on a review of [David Axe](http://www.warisboring.com/)‘s exceptional new book, _War Is Boring_, and in part because those _Mad Men_ posts always take my a couple of days to process).   That said, I did want to call attention to the fact that the episode left me nodding my head in agreement with everything Mike Potemra [wrote about it](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/245721/if-you-don-t-watch-i-mad-men-i-mike-potemra) at _The Corner_, because that's a noteworthy event in itself: the "spectral" note did ring "false," the scene that followed was "an especially great moment," and there was a "lot of truth in that couple of seconds."   More from me on this front shortly.
