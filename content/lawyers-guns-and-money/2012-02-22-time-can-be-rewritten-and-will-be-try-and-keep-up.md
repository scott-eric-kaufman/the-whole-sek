In point of fact, this new universe will be birthed in part because of poor previously excluded Rory. His deaths were such catalysts that the scene from the first episode, "The Eleventh Hour," couldn't be rescripted and reshot in the final episode, "The Big Bang," without Rory playing a central role in the narrative. So what does Haynes do? Cuts from the Doctor occupying a powerful position within the frame to Rory being in a powerful one relative to Amy. This restores the balance implicit in the fairy tale structure of the series: in "The Eleventh Hour," Amy was "The Girl Who Waited," but in "The Big Bang," Rory's christened "The Boy Who Waited." They're not coequal in capability, as my next post will show, but they are coequal in the effect they can have on the Doctor.
