Nolte and Schweizer have two problems: the first is that they're defending a minor point and ignoring the major one; the second is that, by the terms of the analogy when properly distributed, the fact that the United States responded to its Sputnik moment in 1959 _without collapsing_ undermines the legitimacy of their minor point.  If the United States could do it before, surely it could do it again, no?
