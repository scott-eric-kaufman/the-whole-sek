I can only assume he's courting the calloused husband vote here, because I can't think of who else he'd be trying to impress with this brilliant bit of campaign rhetoric.  (Which assumes this statement is intentional, being that this is part of [his charm offensive](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2012/07/mitt-romney-diplomat) and all—but of course it isn't. This is just garden-variety faux-machismo that Romney's using to pander to conservatives who'd never heard the word "dressage" before but immediately associated it with vaginas.)
