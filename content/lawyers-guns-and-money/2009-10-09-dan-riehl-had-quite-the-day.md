If conservatives learned nothing else today, it was that _the rest world disagrees with them on issues of policy and matters of principles_, so you would assume that interacting with it might “not [be] real fun.”  Because when the real world collides with [the Riehl World](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/), it is never real fun … unless you happen not to be Dan Riehl, in which case, it really,

 is.
