My list isn't exhaustive, either, but at least it suggests that _[The Glass Bead Game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312278497/diesekoschmar-20)_ might be tremendously complex or _[The Man Without Qualities](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679767878/diesekoschmar-20)_ can match _Clarissa_ page-for-page. Since my list is a list and, as stated above, all lists are shit, I invite you to give me the what-for in the comments.
