I just don’t know where I’m supposed to be running. I mean, I’m trying to understand the logic behind associating gays in the military with the War on Christmas, but am failing. Badly. Because it almost seems as if Perry _approves_ of gays being in the military, and simply wishes Christian children were afforded the same rights.
