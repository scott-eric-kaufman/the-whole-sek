**UPDATE II:** Or not. I watched CNN while eating lunch and Jane Velez-Mitchell was horrified to discover that “There’s _an entire underground society_ devoted to promoting hatred of the sort the Sikh gunman is alleged to have felt.” I’m tempted to be a grammar scold and tell her that she could probably phrase it better than “the Sikh gunman,” but they’re clearly having a rough day over there, so I’ll relent.
