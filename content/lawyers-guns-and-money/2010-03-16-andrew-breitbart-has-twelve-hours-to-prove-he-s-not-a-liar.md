Remember how, exactly three weeks ago today, Andrew Breitbart [claimed](http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201002230001) that he would "take down the institutional left within three weeks"?  I wonder how that's going.  Before I left for the office this morning, I could still suffer through three hours of _Morning Joe_, and when I checked the [website](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/) a few seconds ago, I could still reach Rachel Maddow's blog.  (Nor are any of his blogs trumpeting his victory.)  How long do we have to wait before we can hire [a tweeting-retracting mountain camel](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2010/02/we-is-a-serious-news-organization-what-demands-you-retract-tweets-now) to start demanding a correction from him?
