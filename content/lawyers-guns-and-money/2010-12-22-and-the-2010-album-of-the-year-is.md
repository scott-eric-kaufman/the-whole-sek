That undermining—the call to “run away” from the person West is perceived to have become—makes his lyrics feel like a transcript from an early (and generally successful) therapy session, and given Americans’ deep and abiding love for privacy, it’s no wonder the album’s reached the critical heights it has.  I just wish critics would stop writing around the issue and admit that their desire to peer inside the mind of celebrity is no less salacious than that of the “average” listener, whomever they imagine him or her to be.
