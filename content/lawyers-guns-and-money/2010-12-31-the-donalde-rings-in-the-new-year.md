The Donalde, it follows, hates working class people who are trying to sell their trucks to make ends meet.  He sincerely hopes men whose trucks I have no interest in buying continue to risk their jobs by taking days off to meet me.  For the sake of all working class people, I sincerely hope his plan fails and that people find my post before they risk losing their jobs.
