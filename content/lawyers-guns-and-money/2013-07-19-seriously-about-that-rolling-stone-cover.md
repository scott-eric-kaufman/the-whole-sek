But liberal and aesthetic critics should have sense enough to realize that the problem with this cover wasn't in its intent so much as its execution. In all honesty, I don't think _Rolling Stone_ should be criticized for its visual-rhetorical failure here, but for rehashing the tired trope of "The Monster Next Door." That's [Keith Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith\_Morrison)â€˜s bailiwick, and Saturday mornings on MSNBC would be infinitely poorer if _Rolling Stone_ put him out of business.
