Which isn’t to say I didn’t prefer the 3,500-word _longer_ version that got nixed by networks and publicists for containing too much specific “behind the scenes” information, mind you. I don’t know what they thought I wasn’t going to include “behind the scenes” information given that I pitched the piece as a “behind the scenes” look at reality cooking television. But that’s neither here nor there.
