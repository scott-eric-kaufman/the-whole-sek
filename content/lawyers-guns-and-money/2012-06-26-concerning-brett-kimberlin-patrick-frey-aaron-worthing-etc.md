And now I’m talking about “orange” when I should be  talking about outrages. I’m still not sure what we can do to put a  stop to Kimberlin and those who anonymously abet him, but it’s a conversation we ought to be having. As someone who’s been harassed in the past—and is facing a new wave of harassment at the present moment—I think it’s incumbent on the left to listen to and contribute to the  conversation going on across the blogs on the right. Because dumb luck  trumps ideology in the sweepstakes to determine who Kimberlin or the  like targets next, and tomorrow may be your “lucky” day.
