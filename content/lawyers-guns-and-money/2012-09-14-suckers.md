I couldn’t resist coining the phrase “tragedy bump,” but I should’ve. That said, I’m sure I missed some from the previous thread, so feel free to elevate those I missed or come up with more. I’m enjoying this intensely even if it isn’t, as people say it should be, a tumblr. I should know what that means, after all, [I’m a tumbler. I’m a government man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcD1fHcGB0). But I don’t.
