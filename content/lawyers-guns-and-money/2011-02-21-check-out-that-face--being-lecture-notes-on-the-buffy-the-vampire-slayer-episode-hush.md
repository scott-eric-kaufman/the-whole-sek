In other words, outside of that one shot, the audience is going to be discomfited by their paralyzed smiles _and_ the blocking as they hover about _and_ odd angles at which they’re shot.  I choose the word “discomfit” for a reason: the Gentlemen don’t horrify the audience so much as unsettle it, and the techniques Whedon uses to unsettle it are intended to be disconcerting, not frightening.
