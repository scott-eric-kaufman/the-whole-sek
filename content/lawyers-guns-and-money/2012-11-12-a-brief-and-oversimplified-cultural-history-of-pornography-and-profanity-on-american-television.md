You can't divorce rhetorical effect from historical context. What  worked in 1996 fails to offend in 2012. This is a blindingly obvious  fact to most people of drinking age, but most of the people I teach  aren't of drinking age. I share this with you because most of the emails  I've received since the "Littlefinger" post concerned how I deal with  the pornography in the classroom when I'm not being flip about it. The  answer, as should be clear, is that I contextualize it.
