This is the political-theater equivalent of a student who's been told he's written a non-passing essay, runs to Rite Aid and buys a snazzy binder, then slips the same essay into it and turns it back in.   The student expects a better grade, but only because _the student is an idiot_.  Until he addresses the failings of his non-passing argument, he's going to continue to receive a non-passing grade.
