I do plan on analyzing all the _Mad Men_ episodes, but the one about thyroid cancer hit too close to home, so I'm a bit behind, and I suck at re-cap. (But you all know that.) Honestly, I've received numerous emails about this, so I should just say that as a survivor/current dealer of or with or whatever you'd called it, with thyroid cancer, there are some things I can't write about ... foremost among them, thyroid cancer. Soon as I'm better, so will my posts be.
