Of the 28 interns Steele posed with, a full 
93 percent
 of them are specularly (and most are spectacularly) white.  This isn’t to say that the Republican National Committee has a racist internship program; after all, the “diversity” of his interns is also a reflection of the diversity of [the applicant pool](http://www.gop.com/index.php/housekeeping/Internships/). Given the lengths to which the GOP goes to appear more inclusive than it actually is, I’m inclined to think those may have been the only non-white people who applied.
