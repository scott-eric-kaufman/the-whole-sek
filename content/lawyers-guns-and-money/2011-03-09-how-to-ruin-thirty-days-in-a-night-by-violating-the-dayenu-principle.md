In short, instead of the quiet, dignified death in the book—which is neither more nor less inherently moving for its quiet dignity, unless you’re talking about its effectiveness—the audience of the film is treated to a beating at the hands of a man who is, in visual rhetorical terms, YELLING YOU THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE YOU WILL BE HAVING.  THERE IS NO _DAYENU_.  THERE IS CAN BE NO ENOUGH.  Add in an image of me thumping on the table with my meaning-stick and you pretty much have my last day of class.
