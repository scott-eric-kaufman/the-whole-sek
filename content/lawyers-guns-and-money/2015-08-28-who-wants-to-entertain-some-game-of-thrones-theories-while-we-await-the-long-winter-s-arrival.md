I [have a take](http://www.salon.com/2015/08/28/the\_latest\_game\_of\_thrones\_fan\_theory\_about\_jon\_snow\_is\_just\_about\_insane\_enough\_to\_be\_right/) on the latest _Game of Thrones_fan-theory about Jon Snow because _of course I do_. Steven will, no doubt, demolish it in the comments — but for the moment, inasmuch as hope can exist in Westeros, it's springing eternal.
