\*I’ve never written up my notes on getting them to think about structure via punchlines, which begins, not surprisingly, here with _The Killing Joke_. The gist of it is that jokes don’t work if you only provide the punchline, which is my way of introducing them to the notion of process: this shot in a film or panel in a comic or argument in an essay only works as a punchline if the joke’s been properly set up. Basically, I try to get them to think about argument in terms they intuitively understand.
