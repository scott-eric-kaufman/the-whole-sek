Case in point: Camille Paglia.  Did her ready-made anti-feminist statements predispose her to drifting so?  Without a doubt.  Were her arguments about the inability of woman to create truly great art always as absurd as they seem now?  Absolutely.  However, she would not have become the media sensation she was in the early '90s had she not packaged her faux-feminist critiques in a language understandable to the general intellectual culture.  There were (and are) many anti-feminst thinkers who rivaled Paglia in virulence but not prominence, and the point of my title was that she now resembles those muted, vainglorious misogynists more than the contrarian firebrand she once was.
