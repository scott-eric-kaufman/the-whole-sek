There is much more to say about this episode, but I wanted to focus on Sally before discussing Peggy’s brief-but-significant appearance and Don’s—I’ll save the bit about Don for later this afternoon.  (And apologies in advance for this post being a bit thin.  It was either divide this week’s episode into three moderately long posts or write one Holbonic one on Thursday.)
