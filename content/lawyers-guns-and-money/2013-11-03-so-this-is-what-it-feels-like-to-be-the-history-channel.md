I've written stories today about a [Sasquatch hunt](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/11/03/three-men-arrested-after-accidental-shooting-during-bigfoot-hunt/) and the [spontaneous combustion of King Tut](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/11/03/egyptologist-finds-evidence-that-king-tut-spontaneously-combusted/). I'm thinking of kicking it old school and writing something about Hitler next.
