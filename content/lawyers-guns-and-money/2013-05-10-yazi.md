The matter-of-fact tone with which this "revelation" is floated is intended to suggest objectivity, but in reality it's just an invitation for conservatives to _Choose Their Own Adventure_. I'm not saying it's an exercise in wish-fulfillment, but the fact that every path leads to Glenn Beck standing boot-to-neck on Obama's bloodied body is certainly suggestive of something.
