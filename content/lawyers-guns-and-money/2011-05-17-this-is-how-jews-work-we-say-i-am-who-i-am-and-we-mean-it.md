I teach for 6 ½ hours today, need to attend a staff meeting, have given up the rest of my day to office hours and must, at some point, eat, so I have no time to deal with [this admittedly hilarious situation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/05/i-have-just-received-a-very-disturbing-email-from-a-very-prominent-conservative-blogger.html).  That said, in whatever moments I can steal from this damnably engorged day, I’d love to find some evidence that the world hasn’t forsaken its sense of humor for a bag of chips and a chopping block.
