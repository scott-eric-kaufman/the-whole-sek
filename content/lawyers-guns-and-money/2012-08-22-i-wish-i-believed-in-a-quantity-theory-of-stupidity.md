As a preview of the thoroughly unpredictable content to come, the person (or persons) named “College Insurrection” has (or have) already pre-posted about how universities [discriminate against rapists](http://collegeinsurrection.com/2012/08/university-without-shame-how-brown-betrayed-one-of-its-students/) and [conservatives](http://collegeinsurrection.com/2012/08/new-study-shows-academia-discriminates-against-conservatives/) and [how kids these days really love Paul Ryan](http://collegeinsurrection.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-welcomed-warmly-at-his-alma-mater/) despite the fact that he wants to steal their Pell Grants. How long before the walruses arrive?
