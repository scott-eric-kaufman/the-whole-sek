The  man can’t even defend _hypothetical_ women without undressing them  in his mind. This isn’t to say the casting call isn’t sexist, because  like most items relating to Hollywood and the female form, it clearly  is.  The point here, as usual, is that conservatives who like to think  of themselves as morally superior to liberals when it comes to racial or  gender equality always reveal themselves to be purveyors of the very  ills they decry.  In this respect, Nolte is no different than  affirmative action opponents who offer, as proof that we live in a  post-racial society, the fact that there’s a nigger in the White House.
