Except it doesn’t.  What repeal actually means is _creating and sustaining the appearance of trying to keep a promise_. Failure to do so will shrink their newly established base and leave them as vulnerable in 2012 as they proved to be in 2008.  Expect to see quite a bit of appearing to be trying to deliver on an undeliverable promise in the next few years.
