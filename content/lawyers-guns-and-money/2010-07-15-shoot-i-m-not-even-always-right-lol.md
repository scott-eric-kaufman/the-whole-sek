\*Before you ask: I am aware that this post is as vapid as the site it links to.  I'd intended to mock him for [writing](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/defeat-of-new-start-treaty-would-not-be.html) "of course ObamaCare has by now proved to be as disastrous as conservatives originally warned," then ask him to show me the death panels, but sheer lunacy of the other posts stopped me short.  Apologies, all.
