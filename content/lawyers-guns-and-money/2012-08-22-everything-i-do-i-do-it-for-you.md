As is often the case at the beginning of the school year, even  secondhand and samizdat copies of textbooks become difficult to acquire. But if someone can score me a copy of [the apparently very august _Elements of Literature for Christian Schools_](http://wonkette.com/481427/things-you-can-learn-in-a-christian-high-school-textbook-for-real-part-i), I promise I'll make it worth everyone's while.
