As I'm about to set off on a cross-country drive that'll take me the better part of three days, it'd be nice to have something to listen to besides music, NPR, and what passes for "political commentary" in the vast Texas wastelands. So feel free to name — and if you're feeling really charitable, link to — some of the better podcasts out there. I'm not too selective about the subject — and on a drive like this, the more variety the better — I'd just like it to be smart. So if you've got a favorite science/history/literary/whatever podcast, give it some love in the comments and I'll repay with you with gratitude, because with the move that's really all I can afford right now.
