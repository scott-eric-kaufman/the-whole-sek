For a long time now I've teased y'all about my theory that _Mad Men_ is really all about Sally instead of Don "The Dick Whitman" Draper. Here's [my attempt to prove it once and for all](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/12/8392379/mad-men-sally-draper). Because it's something I wrote, I don't find it nearly as compelling as it should be, but if nothing else it's a means of starting to reevaluate an ensemble show that's — understandably — tied to the idea that its lead character is a dapper silhouette of a man.
