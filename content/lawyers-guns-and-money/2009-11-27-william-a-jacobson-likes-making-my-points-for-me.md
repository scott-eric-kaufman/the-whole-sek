...**Update (from davenoon)**:  We'd be remiss in not pointing out that Jacobson, in a post complaining about the use of "the race card," approving links to a [diaper load](http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/11/the\_wilding\_of\_sarah\_palin.html) in _The American Thinker_ [_sic_] written by a — cough, cough — "former leftist-feminist Hillary supporter" who describes the treatment of Sarah Palin as a "wilding" and explains that she youstabee a feminist Democrat until she realized that left-wing men never protected her from angry black hoodlums.  Well, "Robin from Berkeley" has _me_ convinced!
