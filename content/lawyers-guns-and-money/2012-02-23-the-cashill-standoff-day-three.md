[Gauntlet thrown](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2012/02/paging-jack-cashill-jack-cashill-paging-jack-cashill) … and there it is, still on the ground. I kicked it, but nothing doing. Not that I did expect or am expecting any different, but it’d be nice to see someone with the guts to defend their argument in a public forum. Otherwise, we’re liable to become a nation of Goldsteins, too “[sick [and] tired [to] care](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=37745)” or even pretend to. Because that’s what “rightwing bad boy[s]” do these days: make unsubstantiated claims before bowing out on account of the vapors they’ve given themselves to avoid ever having defending their specious arguments.
