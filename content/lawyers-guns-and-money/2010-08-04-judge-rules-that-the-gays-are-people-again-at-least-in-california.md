I would like to thank Judge Vaughn Walker for [readmitting the California Gays into the human race](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html).  Itâ€™s nice to see that someone [appointed](http://dailycaller.com/2010/08/04/california-judge-vaughn-walker-hands-victory-to-proposition-8-opponents-daily-intel/) by a noted Gay Agenda-monger like Ronald Reagan actually believes in all that stuff the Tea Party crowd only pays lip service to.
