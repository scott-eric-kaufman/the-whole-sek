The final shot of the episode. The kind of shot that only happens when people know they're being photographed. It's the weakest shot in the episode â€” it awkwardly strives for the kind of iconic status the show's compositions typically acquire casually. It's so annoying, in fact, that I deliberately avoided addressing it when the show first aired, and add this little coda to my original post just in case something in tonight's episode happens to build off it in a way that recuperates its staged stiffness into something meaningful.
