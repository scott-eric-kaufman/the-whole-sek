As those of you who follow me on Facebook know, this is [a sanitized version suitable for public consumption](http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/organized\_chaos\_a\_behind\_the\_scenes\_look\_at\_how\_those\_running\_comic\_cons\_manage\_to\_keep\_it\_together/), but I’m damn proud of it anyway. (It still reads to me like someone took a 5,000 word draft and chopped it down to 1,500, but since that’s what I actually did, I’m sure I’ll always feel that way.)
