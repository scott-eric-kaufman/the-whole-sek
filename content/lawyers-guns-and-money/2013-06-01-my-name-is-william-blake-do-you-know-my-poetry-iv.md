Because it’s Saturday night and there are (and soon will be) so many   new faces around here, I feel the need to remind y’all of who I am and   why I “matter.” This is a primer I wrote for prospective grad students [back in 2007](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/grad\_school\_a\_p.html) when I had things like hope and a future. That it doesn’t reflect that says something. I won’t say what. You’re more than welcome to.
