Two very long and image-laden posts that may be of interest to you: the first discusses [how Frank Darabont establishes tone for the series in the opening scene of AMC’s _The Walking Dead_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/amc-the-walking-dead-series-lecture-notes.html), while the second approaches [the classroom difficulties created by racial stereotypes in _Maus_ and _American Born Chinese_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/american-born-chinese-lecture-notes.html).  I apologize for not posting them here, but I can’t bear the thought of reformatting all those images again.  However, feel free to discuss either or both posts in the comments below.
