This Friday, I'll be leaving my [home country 
of Kenya
](http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/38784/) to visit England for [this conference](http://www.miriad.mmu.ac.uk/visualculture/inc/comics/).  I've never been to England and am a nervous traveler, so you can do the math: I'm not sure what to do for the five days I'll be there without a conference to hold my hand.  In other words, if you had four days in England to do whatever you wanted with, what would you do?
