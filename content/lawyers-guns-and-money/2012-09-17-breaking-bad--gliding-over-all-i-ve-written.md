I also wrote a post about [Walter White and white supremacism](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2012/09/walter-white-is-no-white-savior) but it’s only tangentially related to “Gliding Over All.” So there it is: three posts about a single episode that don’t even begin to do it justice. There may be one more on the horizon, but for now the bulk of my visual rhetoric-related work will consist of readings of the first season of _Game of Thrones_ [for my Fall course](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2012/08/new-syllabus-game-of-thrones-bold-plan-or-blasphemy). I should have the first (of many) posts up tomorrow.
