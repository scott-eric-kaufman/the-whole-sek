3. An _adj._ that isn't one that all the "cool kids" are using because slang is awesome and language changes and only old squares are interested in "conserving" the culture of their forebears because that wouldn't be unintentionally ironic and what would members of the modern Republic Party be if not unwittingly ironic?
