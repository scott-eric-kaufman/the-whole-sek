Of course, _every_ season’s been headed for some horrible end only to have it narrowly averted by characters hewing to convention. (For example, taking your young, attractive babysitter with you on vacation violates all sorts of decorum that marrying her afterwards retroactively assuages.) Point being, since I can’t comfortably dissect _Mad Men_ visually at the moment, I thought I’d at least provide a venue for people to speculate wildly about how the season’s going to end.
