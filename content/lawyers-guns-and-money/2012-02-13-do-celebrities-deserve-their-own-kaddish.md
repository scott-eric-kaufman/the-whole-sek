\*It goes without saying, but it’s worth saying again: there’s no one post to rule them all. This blog will be one thing at one moment and another in another. In point of fact, I’m about to “[[feign] some kind of cultural superiority … even though [my] opinions and tastes are largely shite of the first water [that force most commenters to] make an effort to shaddup when [I] want to wax long and philosophical about some mainstream film [I’m] content to call art.](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2012/02/whitney-houston-again/comment-page-1#comment-224598)” If you’d like to take me to task for that, by all means, go at me with gusto. Just try to make your criticism coherent.
