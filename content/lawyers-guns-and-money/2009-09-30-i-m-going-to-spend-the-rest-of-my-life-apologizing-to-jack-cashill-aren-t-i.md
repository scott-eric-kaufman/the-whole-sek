When I first [wrote](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/who-really-wrot.html) that anyone who uses "Cashill's juvenile musings as a hypothetical which, if true, suggests all the unsavory things [they] already believe about Obama," I didn't know that Cashill also bought into Intelligent Design, but it makes sense that someone who could compile and be convinced by the evidence above would be a subject of King Tendentiousness himself.  Like ID, Cashill's theory consists of details inexpertly cobbled together by deeply interested parties.  The similar caveat applies in both: should it turn out that one day the Great Designer reveals Himself or Obama admits that Ayers helped edit his memoir, the soundness of their respective methodologies would not be validatedâ€”all that will be proven is that sometimes tendentious idiots get lucky.
