So stop playing Internet Detective with insufficient evidence and base your argument on the fact that because Sterling was SUSPECTED of having a gun, he was slammed to the ground, held down, and shot dead â€” whereas Dylann Roof, the Charleston church shooter, was KNOWN to have murdered multiple innocent parishioners and pulled over, escorted to Burger King in a bullet-proof vest, and is currently receiving the due process supposedly guaranteed to every American.
