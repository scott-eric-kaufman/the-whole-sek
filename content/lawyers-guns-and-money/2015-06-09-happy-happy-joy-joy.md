I'm not sure which story I enjoy more — the one about the man who requested a "[summer break](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/06/dinesh\_dsouzas\_request\_for\_a\_summer\_break\_from\_community\_service\_gets\_slapped\_down\_by\_federal\_judge/)" from his federal conviction saying that [_other_criminals downplay the severity of _their_ crimes](http://www.salon.com/2015/06/09/dinesh\_dsouza\_boasts\_to\_fox\_news\_im\_using\_my\_community\_service\_hours\_to\_indoctrinate\_immigrants\_against\_obama/) or the one about [the evangelical preacher who left one bank because it was gay friendly only to deposit his father's money in another that's gay friendlier](http://www.salon.com/2015/06/09/franklin\_graham\_leaves\_gay\_friendly\_wells\_fargo\_for\_gay\_friendlier\_north\_carolina\_bank/).
