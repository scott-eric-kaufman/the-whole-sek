In  both shots, a claimant to the throne is surrounded by a repetitive  vertical element that meets slightly to the right of frame-center. By  structuring the shots the same, Minahan invites the audience to pay  attention to the differences: Joffrey's vertical elements terminate at  hard wooden walls and ceiling, creating a claustrophobic effect  amplified by his retracted posturing, as if he wished there were more  wall for him to cower before; Dany's vertical elements extend into open  sky, and she stands with her dragon before her and her friends beside  her, resulting in a shot as expansive as Joffrey's is confining. Same  structure, similarly stationed subjects, but these shots convey vastly  different messages about the "service" required by the throne.
