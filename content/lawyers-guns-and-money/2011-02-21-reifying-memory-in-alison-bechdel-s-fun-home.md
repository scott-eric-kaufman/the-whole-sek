_Fun Home_ reifies memory via narrative, but it does so in a way that reminds readers that human beings aren’t made of words.  Granted, the above panel is about as word-specific as word-picture relations come, but in a graphic novel it’s panels like this one that are intruding on the conventions of the medium.  People typically think of their memories as feelings and images punctuated by what others said, but outside of graphic novels the only means of communicating them _without recourse to someone else’s interpretation of them_ is through words.  This difference is figured in the book as the relation between Gatsby in the novel and Redford’s portrayal of him onscreen: the former remains closer to Fitzgerald’s vision of him because there’s no other mind translating, via performance, Gatsby for the audience.
