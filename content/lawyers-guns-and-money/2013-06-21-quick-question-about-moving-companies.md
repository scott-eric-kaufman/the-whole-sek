How does one go about finding a reputable moving company? Because I feel like a freshmen trying to do academic research for the first time: I don't know what reviews are authoritative, which companies are scams, how to differentiate between parties vigorously sqabbling over online reviews, etc. If you're not comfortable leaving feedback in the comments, you can send it scotterickaufman (at) gmail (dot) com. I thank any and all in advance for whatever advice you provide.
