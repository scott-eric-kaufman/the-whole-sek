I admit that there may be [some meat](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/walker-has-koch-and-aspirin-for.html) in [the interview "David Koch" scored with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker](http://www.buffalobeast.com/?p=5045), but the most significant element of the _Buffalo Beast_‘s prank is its very existence.  It demonstrates, concretely, how beholden conservatives feel to the Koch brothers.  Unlike the Rachel-Maddow-takes-marching-orders-from-George-Soros-type conspiracies that pass for common wisdom in conservative circles, here we have a sitting governor, at the height of a political crisis, confiding in billionaire from Manhattan about, among other things, the influence of out-of-state figures on the protests in Madison.
