As most of you know, my brand of film theory is heavily indebted to David Bordwell and neoformalism. So it should come as no surprise that I believe Bordwell's [compilation of posts from 2012](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/13/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2012/) could very well function as an online film theory textbook, especially when read in tandem with similar compilations from [2007](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/09/06/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class/), [2008](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2008/09/06/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2008/), [2009](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2009/09/22/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2009/), [2010](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/09/02/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2010/), and [2011](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/08/22/is-there-a-blog-in-this-class-2011/). If you ever have to teach a course in film or film theory — or if you've ever wanted to take a seminar on film or film theory — now you have the material you need to do so.
