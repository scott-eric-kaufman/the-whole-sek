The ultimate irony, of course, is his claim that this new moderate Islam "will have to be non-literal and reformist."   McCarthy openly and unselfconsciously confesses that religious beliefs based on one-thousand-year-old books—or, for that matter, political beliefs based on two-hundred-year-old documents—might be obsolete, if not outright dangerous, when the people who possess them interpret their sacred texts literally.   His opposition to literalism as an interpretive mode is to be commended, or would be, if it extended to the Old Testament or the Constitution.   But neither of those texts are "anti-constitutional and anti-freedom," at least not in the Platonic form in which they exist in [the minds of people who have never read them](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2010/08/an-accurate-description-of-your-work-requires-adjectives-i-dont-have).
