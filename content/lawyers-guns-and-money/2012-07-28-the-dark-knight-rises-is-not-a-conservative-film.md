In this case, the competing political interpretations of _The Dark Knight Rises_ are not the result of the multivalenced nature of all aesthetic objects so much as _simple incompetence from one of competitors_. There are sophisticated arguments that the film’s politics don’t square with contemporary liberal or leftist thought—see [Aaron Bady](http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/do-not-go-gentle-into-that-dark-knight/) or [Henry Farrell](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/24/the-dark-knight-rises/) or [Jeff Spross and Zack Beauchamp](http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/07/26/581591/dark-knight-christopher-nolan/)—but  it’s no coincidence that those analyses are eminating from the left.  Conservatives aren’t accustomed to considering cultural artifacts with  the seriousness they merit, and so on the rare occasion they want to  claim ideological kinship with one, they have no idea how.
