The worst thing about this cooking show?  The Donalde spent [_all night_](http://twitter.com/AmPowerBlog/status/25016620453) writing the script.  So my choices are "sad, sad little man" or "brilliant performance artist," and because I want to maintain my faith in humanity, I'm going with the latter.
