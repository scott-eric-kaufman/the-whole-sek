<p>So if you&#8217;ve never listened to this podcast and have just heard the (true) rumors that we bicker like an old Jewish married couple about <em>Game of Thrones</em> every week &#8212; well, it&#8217;s time to stop not-listening to us, because we managed to work through the issues with this last episode &#8212; <em>and there are many </em>&#8212; as adeptly as as anyone this side of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/05/17/game-of-thrones-season-5-episode-6-review-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/">Alyssa</a> has.</p>
<p>Basically &#8212; if you must listen to one episode of this podcast, this is the one. And we address the questions you want answered right at the beginning too, because we&#8217;re polite like that.</p>

		<p>Just to add a pensée d&#8217;escalier: I forgot to mention an idea I had about Littlefinger and Sansa. A lot of people have been asking why LF would abandon Sansa to Ramsay &#8211; but what if LF wants to &#8220;rescue&#8221; Sansa from Ramsay the same way he tried to rescue Catelyn from Brandon, as a way to &#8220;make&#8221; Sansa love him romantically?</p>

		<p>I wondered that, Sansa after Ramsay realizes that sleazy Uncle Pete is not so bad&#8230;but honestly I don&#8217;t care at this point what logical basis there is for this stuff.</p>

		<p>To be honest, Littlefinger&#8217;s affection for Sansa ends the moment it costs him something. The only things Baelish is capable of loving with any degree of authenticity is (a) power and (b) his ability to get it. Lacking those things was why he couldn&#8217;t have Catelyn, so they&#8217;ve become his fixation and this fixation has replaced any real emotional attachment to actual people.</p>

		<p>FWIW the showrunners have said that LF does not in fact know about Ramsay&#8217;s behavior, in the book he&#8217;s quite infamous in Westeros but in the Show he&#8217;s really not known outside the vicinity of the Dreadfort&#8230;</p>
<p>but still, LF seems to be the type of guy who makes it his business to know what is not widely known&#8230;</p>

		<p>I read this too, and it strains credibility that this know-everything, be-everywhere character doesn&#8217;t know anything about a guy who hunts women with dogs for sport. That&#8217;s not exactly something that people wouldn&#8217;t gossip about, especially when he&#8217;s the bastard son of a fairly major lord.</p>

		<p>There has to be some limit to Ramsay&#8217;s infamy, the Starks clearly know nothing about it.</p>
<p>Eddard wouldn&#8217;t have stood for it, and Robb wouldn&#8217;t have trusted the relief of Winterfell to him.</p>

		<p>Think about what you&#8217;re saying: Ramsay&#8217;s reputation can&#8217;t be all that bad, because the famously myopic and overly trusting characters who got themselves killed because of their inability to correctly read people&#8230; didn&#8217;t know about him?  </p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t hold water, does it?</p>
<p>My point is, the show has portrayed Littlefinger as having intimate knowledge of everything that happens in Westeros. It&#8217;s difficult for me to believe he has such a blind spot about a character like Ramsay.</p>

		<p>Littlefinger isn&#8217;t omniscient, but you&#8217;re basically right&#8211;if for nothing else, Ramsay&#8217;s habit of skinning the minor lords and ladies who don&#8217;t pay their taxes certainly would have gotten out.</p>

		<p>While we see Roose&#8217;s private conversations with Ramsey where he disapproves of this practice on a practical level (the Boltons do not have a strong enough claim on the North yet to do this), whatever Ramsey does publicly  is imputed to Roose. Skinning rebellious lords alive is well within the Overton Window of Westerosi governance (lords who rebelled against Tywin Lannister had their entire extended families including small children killed). It wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be seen as cruelty personal to Ramsey or a sign that he&#8217;d treat his wife with the same cruelty.</p>

		<p>It strains even more credulity that the fact that Sansa Stark was escorted to Winterfell by Littlefinger has been so thoroughly suppressed that he can brazenly lie to Cersei about it.  I know that Cersei is down a spymaster (and in general not very rational where Sansa is concerned), but the show&#8217;s depiction of its world&#8217;s rumor mill seems really arbitrary.  Everyone &#8211; and I do mean everyone, down to the lowliest commoner &#8211; knows that Loras is gay, but nobody knows that Ramsay is a sadist.  Maester Aemon can receive up to date reports on Daenerys at the Wall, but Cersei has no idea that Littlefinger was in Winterfell.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any justification for it except writerly fiat.</p>

		<p>No, information really is like that.  Would you gossip about a vicious sadist?  What if he found out you did?  In contrast, there&#8217;s not a shadow of a punishment for talking about Loras being gay.</p>
<p>Besides these two examples, people don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know.  Hardest fact to accept in scientific inquiry.</p>

		<p>You have to have your information networks up and running in order to get information. Westeros is still split by war, even if it&#8217;s a cold war of sorts in most places (and about to get a lot colder, IYKWIM), and especially with regards to Winterfell, who is there who would be loyal enough to the Lannisters to feed Cersei information? Roose owed his debt of gratitude to Tywin, who is dead, and his daughter might not necessarily inherit that debt, although she might think she does. Winterfell was almost depopulated by the time the Boltons took over, and anyone who&#8217;s left not only wouldn&#8217;t want to risk their skin (literally) to complain to King&#8217;s Landing, they&#8217;re not going to risk it for the family that took Ned Stark&#8217;s head. The only incentive would be money, and with the Lannisters <em>and</em> the crown broke, the guy with the money would be Littlefinger, who may be the richest person left in Westeros with the possible exception of the Tyrells.</p>

		<p>@Halloween Jack &#8211; very well put, though I also agree with what Abigail says. The flow of information in the show seems arbitrary and subject to the requirements of the story, and not very believable. </p>
<p>@Pat &#8211; people talk. Even Joffrey couldn&#8217;t stop people from talking.</p>

		<p>You are correct, of course, that people talk.  But Jack&#8217;s point, that there weren&#8217;t a lot of people left up at Winterfell to talk about Ramsey, is a different situation than at Westeros.  In Westeros, people are packed together and gossip is a major diversion.  At Winterfell, it&#8217;s possible that Ramsey&#8217;s crimes weren&#8217;t spoken of.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a normal human reaction to things well beyond the pale &#8211; oh, it couldn&#8217;t be <em>that</em> bad.  So the very worst is often not believed.</p>

		<p>I picture the North as being much more insular, not just in general, but at each level of society.  The harsh winters create a greater need for self sufficiency.  Roads are impassable for years on end.  There are fewer navigable rivers, and they are often frozen.  There&#8217;s less trade.  There are fewer outsiders.  Outsiders are not trusted with stories.</p>
<p>Peter uses his commercial interests for much of his spying.  He may have almost none in the far north.</p>

		<p>Late but <em>A lot of people have been asking why LF would abandon Sansa to Ramsay – but what if LF wants to “rescue” Sansa from Ramsay the same way he tried to rescue Catelyn from Brandon, as a way to “make” Sansa love him romantically?</em></p>
<p>Well, I was talking with someone and they just out and out said Littlefinger deployed Sansa as bait for Cersei. Full stop. So I was asking where they got that from and it was from the scene with LF and Cersei. I think that&#8217;s right. By turning over Sansa to the Boltons, LF guaranteed that Cersei would go after them. And there&#8217;s Littlefinger with an army offering to help.</p>
<p>As you said in your column, LF has total flexibility to take advantage of the situation now. Whichever way it goes, LF is going to be Warden of the North (including if he lines up with Stannis against Cersei and the Boltons and offers up his army to support Stannis in attacking King&#8217;s Landing. (A possibility I think you didn&#8217;t include.)</p>
<p>So Sansa is the poison pill for the Boltons here. As a bonus, he can &#8216;rescue&#8217; her and presumably marry her when he&#8217;s Warden of the North. And that suits Littlefingers purposes exactly because he would have totally taken Eddard&#8217;s place with Sansa serving as a Catelyn substiture.</p>
<p>And of course, were he to line up with Stannis in exchange for the North, Stannis can destroy himself fighting the Lannisters for King&#8217;s Landing and Littlefinger could then swoop in and take over, presumably by aligning himself with the Martells. And then the little substitute Stark children fathered by Littlefinger would be be princes and princesses.</p>
<p>The thing is, is that I&#8217;m not clear tv show LF understands how bad Ramsay is. As a consequence, Sansa&#8217;s going to try and escape (I think), and that&#8217;s the purpose served by the wedding night scene. Sansa now has every reason to try and escape the Boltons and head North, presumably to the Wall. And solid reasons to turn to Theon and Brienne, even if she disdains them.</p>
<p>If she does escape, she&#8217;s going to run smack dab into Stannis&#8217; army and given Stannis&#8217;s attitude towards her father, I&#8217;d assume he&#8217;d take her in. At which point she might very well spill all of Littlefinger&#8217;s plans (because he gave her to Ramsay), thus completely screwing up LF&#8217;s scheme. Meaning that LF&#8217;s (possible) miscalculation about Ramsay may screw up all his plans, while also screwing Ramsay himself.</p>
<p>I think the scene with Sansa and Ramsay might be the hinge the entire North turns on. Even if he&#8217;s a psychopath, if he&#8217;d treated her decently, she might well be inclined to stay in Winterfell and wait for Littlefinger.</p>
<p>So, having been through the same scene as Sansa myself, I can absolutely agree it&#8217;s horrible, I think it was absolutely necessary to the plot, unlike the scene with Jaime and Cersei, which could have dropped entirely profitably.</p>
<p>I just couldn&#8217;t get the notion of why LF would expend a valuable asset like that. Jayne Poole wasn&#8217;t valuable to LF, but Sansa very definitely is, but that&#8217;s how she&#8217;s turned out to be valuable &#8211; as bait.</p>
<p>max<br />
[&#8216;I think he figured she&#8217;d be &#8216;safe&#8217; enough, but I think he miscalculated.&#8217;]</p>

		<p>I agree with this.  Sansa is bait; Littlefinger didn&#8217;t think it would be all sunshine and roses for her, but didn&#8217;t expect that Ramsay would be so awful to her.  After all, she&#8217;s not a random servant or a prisoner of war who can be hunted with dogs with relative impunity&#8211;she has real value and status in the North (hence the marriage in the first place) and is important to the Boltons&#8217; ambitions.  Ramsay&#8217;s inability to control his psychopathy even when it would be to his advantage is going to be his undoing.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Ramsay’s inability to control his psychopathy even when it would be to his advantage is going to be his undoing.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is where LF really is at, he has to know that Ramsay has a terrible reputation- but it is quote possible that he doesn&#8217;t quite understand/comprehend that Ramsay is not your garden variety over-privileged scumbag, he&#8217;s not Roose, if Rasmay was not a lord&#8217;s son (bastard) he&#8217;d still be incredibly dangerous because he&#8217;d be a serial killer- LF deals with terrible people all the time (hell he is one)- but someone who is fat out irrational? That&#8217;s very hard for some people to deal with/contend with.</p>
<p>Viewers wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied with this fate for Ramsay, but it wouldn&#8217;t be out of place in the show&#8217;s or the book&#8217;s world for Roose to decide he has to garrote Ramsay, heir or not.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm&#8230;I thought there was something odd about that scene between Roose and Ramsey, where Lord Bolton asks, &#8220;Will you help me hold it?&#8221; and Ramsey said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t quite put my finger on it; I wonder if Roose is sending his son out to die in battle to make a place for his true-born heir.</p>
<p>Here, son, go lead an army against the best battle commander in Westeros. I&#8217;ll be right behind you.</p>
<p> Or, if Ramsey <em>thinks</em> that&#8217;s what his father is doing.</p>

		<p>In the books, Cersei is driven to restore to FM because they are one of the major creditors of the crown along with the Iron Bank and the Tyrells. In exchange for forgiving the debt, she agrees to let them restore their army. So it&#8217;s more a demonstration of her strengths as a tactical, but not a long-term strategic thinker rather than her personal vindictiveness or hatred of Margaery. </p>
<p>Worst case scenario, LF thinks that Ramsey is cut from the same cloth as Roose or at least can be controlled by him, someone who enjoys being utterly ruthless and cruel to enemies when given the chance, but also a very accomplished player of the game who knows when and where to deploy that cruelty.</p>

		<p>I think it&#8217;s worth remembering that this was always going to be rape.  Sansa did not want to have sex with Ramsay, and Littlefinger had to know that by marrying him she&#8217;d have to submit to that.  The fact that the sex was violent and humiliating is merely crap icing on the shit cake.</p>
<p>So the fact that Littlefinger doesn&#8217;t balk at this suggests to me that the issue is less what he does or does not believe about Ramsay, and more that he&#8217;s a man in a rape culture, and there are some things he doesn&#8217;t think about.  Compare him to, say, Olenna, who marries her granddaughter to a sadist and then makes damn sure that he doesn&#8217;t live long enough to even be alone with her after their marriage.  In the world of the show, that&#8217;s something a woman would think about, not necessarily a man.</p>

		<p>I think that this is an important point. In this world, Sansa&#8217;s rape is more rule than exception. With that being the case, I think it&#8217;s worth showing if for no other reason then that it lets the audience know what can happen when powerful men arrange political marriages. Just as the battle scenes let us know that what&#8217;s going on isn&#8217;t just dudes in tents moving wood pieces around.</p>
<p>Also, I really doubt that Little Finger, even if he knew about Ramsey&#8217;s hobbies, would have guessed that he&#8217;d be so horrible to Sansa. One thing to remember is that, however shitty a human being he is, Roose Bolton seems to treat Walda well. She&#8217;s one of the few characters that seems more or less content. Little Finger might be forgiven for thinking that, like his father, Ramsey had the sense enough to know that his wife is important&#8230;even if he doesn&#8217;t have the empathy to know that she&#8217;s important because she&#8217;s an individual with feelings, he ought to know that it is in his interest to treat her well as she is a member of an important house and his family&#8217;s one shot at legitimizing their rule of the North in the eyes of the common people. </p>
<p>Also, I wonder what Roose&#8217;s reaction will be if Sansa is traumatized in a way that he notices. He obviously has no problem with rape, but I wonder what he would think about how his son behaved, given his disgust for how his son behaved at that dinner.</p>

		<p>I think the actor who plays Ramsay has said that basically the presence of Roose means that Ramsay can&#8217;t slap Sansa around in public&#8230; So I would think her being visibly emotionally traumatized would get his attention, but I don&#8217;t think we/he are going to see that, she was a bit stony-faced before the wedding and she&#8217;ll be stony-faced afterwards. Which may help her with Ramsay, pleading and begging encourages him (and whining/complaining &#8220;bores him&#8221;) She remains outwardly unemotional and brutal as it is to say, he may just go and pick on someone else.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s quite possible that LF didn&#8217;t think of what he thought was going to happen to Sansa&#8211;she would have to submit to sex with her husband against her inclination&#8211;as rape at all.  It&#8217;s probably expected that decent men won&#8217;t use excessive force or unnecessarily humiliate their wives, but it&#8217;s fully expected that a husband can make his wife have sex with him.  Ramsey crossed the line, by this standard, not by raping Sansa, but by being unnecessarily cruel and forceful.</p>

		<p>The scene between Roose and Ramsey was very powerful because it confirmed that Roose was cut from the same psychotic cloth as Ramsey, but is just able to know when and where to deploy it. Roose would never, for example, mistreat his wife or a servant unless they gave him cause. Even then, Roose played very fast and loose when he was younger- given that Ned Stark&#8217;s father would have had him beheaded had word of his &#8220;First Night&#8221; antics gotten back to Winterfell.</p>

		<p>Concerning Dorne, I would agree that its so far disappointing. However, I&#8217;m surprised you two missed Bronn&#8217;s whole &#8220;Oh, its cute how you nicked me with your little girl daggers, daughter-of-the-badass-who-liked-to-coat-his-weapons-with-poison-that-turns-your-blood-into-liquid-fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, we are all aware that Bronn is basically a dead man walking, right? Anyway, hopefully it gets better once Doran, Jamie, and Ellaria have their sitdown.</p>
<p>The scene between Myranda and Sansa was brilliant, but was ruined with the subsequent &#8220;bedding&#8221; scene and made that scene all the more vile. It undercut Sansa&#8217;s trajectory in a really obnoxious and superfluous way and, as I said in the other thread, if the point of that scene was to launch into Theon&#8217;s redemption, it&#8217;s all the more gross.</p>

		<blockquote><p>It undercut Sansa’s trajectory</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m getting really tired of statements like this and their rather loud subtext that &#8220;strong women don&#8217;t get raped.&#8221;  Strong women do get raped, especially when they live in a hellish, misogynistic rape culture.  The purpose of Sansa and Myranda&#8217;s scene isn&#8217;t to establish that Sansa&#8217;s is unrapeable by sheer virture of her burgeoning awesomeness.  It&#8217;s to establish that she understands at least a little of what she&#8217;s facing, and that she has enough nerve and presence of mind not to break in front a mean girl commoner.  This does not make her able to withstand rape as if it were nothing, but it hopefully implies that she has the mental resources to recover from it and perhaps act to protect herself in the future.</p>

		<p>Thank you!  I have read more than one comment lamenting that scene because &#8220;it makes Sansa just a passive victim again.&#8221;  WTF?!?!?  The idea that being raped means Sansa is no longer a strong character with a growing understanding of how to use the power she has is both offensive and stupid.  </p>
<p>The decision to include this scene is certainly debateable, but not because being raped somehow diminishes Sansa as a strong person.</p>

		<p>Sansa&#8217;s trajectory isn&#8217;t that she&#8217;s becoming &#8220;strong&#8221; (an utterly vague word that I myself am getting rather tired of), but that she is learning how to use her intelligence and empathy for something other than mere survival. There was none of that in the scene. </p>
<p>And this does not suggest that she ought to be somehow &#8220;unrapeable,&#8221; but that the scene has no narrative purpose other than the most crass kind of emotional manipulation. You know how many people I&#8217;ve come across saying that they felt worse for <em>Theon</em>?</p>
<blockquote><p>hopefully implies that she has the mental resources to recover from it and perhaps act to protect herself in the future</p></blockquote>
<p>Are we seriously going to start debating the merits of rape as a character-building exercise?</p>

		<blockquote><p>You know how many people I’ve come across saying that they felt worse for Theon?</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s something wrong with those people.<br />
Theon had always been a worm, after Ramsay he&#8217; a victimized worm.<br />
Felt bad for him when he was getting tortured, sure, felt bad for him when it was obvious his father didn&#8217;t ever give two shits for him, but he stabbed the Starks in the back, and sure he didn&#8217;t kill Bra and Rick, but those two dead kids are still his fault.<br />
The only way that character could ever (and I mean ever) have remotely redeemed himself, was by doing something ANYTHING last episode. That scene was not the start of a redemption arc for Theon, it was merely confirmation that he&#8217;s a broken waste in addition to confirmation that Ramsay is uncontrollably sadistic.</p>

		<blockquote><p>And this does not suggest that she ought to be somehow “unrapeable,” but that the scene has no narrative purpose other than the most crass kind of emotional manipulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the scene takes place towards the beginning of a narrative arc that will take several other episodes to play out, might it be a bit too early to declare that it had no purpose, just because you don&#8217;t see that purpose yet and didn&#8217;t like the scene for other reasons?</p>

		<p>Perhaps, but I don&#8217;t see any useful avenue it could go down, and I suspect it will end up being more about Theon than Sansa, which is one of the worst possible directions it can go.</p>

<p>So, you&#8217;re not saying that Sansa is too strong to be raped.  You&#8217;re saying she&#8217;s too intelligent and empathetic to be raped.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, given the situation and the personalities involved, what is it that you imagine Sansa could have done to stop Ramsay?  </p>
<blockquote><p>Are we seriously going to start debating the merits of rape as a character-building exercise?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s only the exact opposite of what I wrote.  I&#8217;m not saying that rape is going to build Sansa&#8217;s character.  I&#8217;m saying that Sansa has character, which will hopefully help her recover from the experience of being raped.</p>
<p>(Having said that, though, let&#8217;s not pretend that character-building through misery and torment hasn&#8217;t been the show&#8217;s go-to approach with Sansa from day one.)</p>

		<blockquote><p>So, you’re not saying that Sansa is too strong to be raped. You’re saying she’s too intelligent and empathetic to be raped.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I&#8217;m saying her rape doesn&#8217;t serve any good narrative purpose, particularly at this juncture, and particularly not for Sansa herself.</p>
<p>Could it serve any useful narrative purpose, not just for Sansa but for anyone else? Maybe. But neither in the manner nor period in which it occurred. </p>
<blockquote><p>(Having said that, though, let’s not pretend that character-building through misery and torment hasn’t been the show’s go-to approach with Sansa from day one.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone is pretending that. I&#8217;d argue what the material is often, though not always, very good at is subverting the idea of redemptive suffering. Theon and Arya, for instance, don&#8217;t become &#8220;better&#8221; because they suffer. Those transformations have distinct trajectories based upon who those characters are at the outset, and their subsequent narrative arc is based upon how they follow that trajectory. </p>
<p>How does Theon handle his own masculinity &#8211; of his conception of his own masculinity &#8211; taken away from him? How does Arya cope with the contradiction that in order to fulfill her quest for revenge, she has to not be Arya anymore? </p>
<p>Sansa is no different; how does she cope with the fact that her ideals of courtly love were nothing more than childish fantasy? My gripe is that her rape neither helped nor hindered her.</p>

		<p>Sansa was cut off from her roots when her wolf was slaughtered.  She has been adrift in the world ever since.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think it does change Sansa&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>The last time she fell into the hands of a psycho (Joffrey), it was all she could do to stay alive while submitting to him.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t assume that that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to go this time. That character has learned a lot since Season 2. In fact, I think that&#8217;s the point of this whole set-up; we&#8217;re going get to see a tougher, craftier, more mature Sansa draw on her experiences to resist and maybe even defeat her tormentor.</p>

		<p>Man, we can only hope.  I abandoned reading the books because I despised the way that the inner lives of most of the female characters were presented.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an interesting angle to this.  Theon was completely broken by Ramsey.  Will Sansa avoid the same fate?  How?</p>

		<p>If I&#8217;m wrong and they go in completely the opposite direction &#8211; Sansa turns into a puddle and is rescued by Theon, whose honor is rekindled by the sight of her in distress &#8211; I&#8217;m going to be royally pissed off at the producers.</p>

		<p>The shitty thing is I can see them doing just that. If after all of this we find Sansa reduced to a mere object of other people&#8217;s gallantry, I am going to be pretty disappointed too. Especially when her sister&#8217;s character arc is such an obvious contrast.</p>

		<p>Meh, I still think its more likely that Sansa &#8220;rescues&#8221; Theon.<br />
She has to get out, she needs someone inside to help her, she&#8217;s going to have to push Theon to help, he won&#8217;t do it on his own.</p>

		<blockquote><p>There’s also an interesting angle to this. Theon was completely broken by Ramsey. Will Sansa avoid the same fate? How?</p></blockquote>
<p>Theon and Sansa are different people in terms of identity and, in some respect, Sansa was already broken &#8211; or had her identity stripped from her &#8211; in King&#8217;s Landing. Subjecting her to further torment at the hands of Ramsay doesn&#8217;t really accomplish anything, narratively speaking.</p>
<p>Theon&#8217;s entire conception of himself rested on a particularly entitled and resentful form of masculinity. His torture and disfigurement at the hands of Ramsay took that from him, rendering him an almost non-person. That transformation was grotesque to witness, but it at least had something thoughtful to say. Subjecting Sansa to that same level of abuse doesn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>JfL: I honestly think you are right about this. The producers gave us a glimpse into Sansa&#8217;s thought process at the end of the last season and I don&#8217;t think it was a red herring in terms of her character arc.</p>
<p>Moreover, I can&#8217;t accept (sans evidence) that the show&#8217;s producers would be so wasteful. If it turns out that Sansa&#8217;s main purpose is to be rescued as a turning point in Theon&#8217;s storyline then she really has very little story that is her own. She&#8217;s there to demonstrate how vicious Joffrey and Ramsey (again) are, how manipulative Littlefinger is, how Tyrion isn&#8217;t such a bad guy, and how Theon isn&#8217;t beyond hope. Setting aside how disappointing this would be personally, it would also be objectively a massive waste of screen time. Did we really need to have Sansa on screen so much just to establish her as a damsel in distress?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d much rather believe they are going somewhere with all this and that somewhere involves real character development for Sansa. Given that their last seemingly pointless, deliberate, extended diversion into sadism was the introduction of Ramsey Snow there is some reason to hope they aren&#8217;t just cluelessly dicking around.</p>

		<p>I could maybe accept your analysis of Sansa&#8217;s choice if the show had portrayed her grimly determined to endure Ramsay&#8217;s brutality. But we didn&#8217;t get that. We got Theon&#8217;s reaction. I think you need to have a look at Libby Hill&#8217;s excellent piece on this horrible hour of television: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/18/game_of_thrones_recap_the_honor_of_your_presence_is_requested_at_another_brutal_wedding/" rel="nofollow">http://www.salon.com/2015/05/18/game_of_thrones_recap_the_honor_of_your_presence_is_requested_at_another_brutal_wedding/</a></p>
<p>At this point, I&#8217;m basically hate-watching the show.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8220;this horrible hour.&#8221; Everything in the episode aside from the last scene was actually very good. In a sense, its kind of like Mass Effect 3; one of the greatest RPG narratives ever that was overshadowed by stupid ending that steals attention away from everything else.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll grant that there were decent bits &#8212; Arya in the house of Black &amp; White, the Jorah and Tyrion roadshow, Olenna and Cersei&#8217;s verbal sparring, Bronn&#8217;s singing and his exasperated one-liner, &#8220;oh for fuck&#8217;s sake&#8221; (he&#8217;s speaking for the audience here). But on the whole, it was pretty terrible, and IMO the wheels have kind of fallen off.  </p>
<p>In ascending order of awfulness: </p>
<p>* Why does Cersei need Littlefinger to come to King&#8217;s Landing and pledge his allegiance? Why would she believe a word he says? At this point, does anyone trust him? Why would they? </p>
<p>* Lena Headey&#8217;s Cersei is a great character, but she&#8217;s been completely undermined this season by her ridiculous missteps, most notably re-forming the Faith Militant and breaking the Lannister alliance with the Tyrells. </p>
<p>* The Faith Militant are absurd. How did an untrained, ill-equipped band of irregulars take over the capital city from the Kingsguard and the men-at-arms of the great houses? </p>
<p>* Why would the FM countenance Baelish? Because Cersei says so? But why do they countenance Cersei? To this question, Stannis made certain that everyone in the Seven Kingdoms knew about Jamie and Cersei way back at the beginning of Season 2. Moreover, Lancel has first-hand knowledge of Cersei&#8217;s proclivities. And weren&#8217;t the FM were disbanded by the Targaryens in the first place *because* the FM didn&#8217;t approve of the Targaryen custom of sibling relations? </p>
<p>* Margaery spent a good deal of screen time cultivating a beloved  &#8220;Princess Di&#8221; persona. Even setting aside Tommen&#8217;s inability to defend his queen, there should have been a violent uproar against her arrest. </p>
<p>* Fox Force Five encounters Bob Hope and Bing Crosby while trying to kidnap/rescue the princess. Even Scott and Steven, who generally liked the episode, admit this scene was bad. </p>
<p>* Having the kennel-master&#8217;s daughter bathe Sansa. </p>
<p>* And of course, the last scene, whose awfulness is well-documented in the Hill piece I linked to, The Atlantic&#8217;s roundtable discussion, TheMarySue, and elsewhere. Basically, it was a long-expected and long-dreaded coupling of Abusive Character and Victim Character. As an audience member, I needed/hoped for something unexpected to happen here. But it just didn&#8217;t.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Lena Headey’s Cersei is a great character, but she’s been completely undermined this season by her ridiculous missteps, most notably re-forming the Faith Militant and breaking the Lannister alliance with the Tyrells.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her character is just too effing stupid for Olenna&#8217;s usual tactics to work- which I think Olenna realized to her dismay- mutual assured destruction can&#8217;t work if one side can&#8217;t grasp that that is the outcome-</p>
<p>Her grandchildren are being held hostage, her oaf of a son has been sent off- but she&#8217;s still at liberty (which in her mind is a huge mistake by Cersei)- my guess is she has a play or two to try (including dealing with the High Sparrow, whom I guess she suspects is an independent actor and not a puppet for Cersei), before she pulls the plug on the alliance with the Lannisters (Do the Tyrells have enough armed men in the city to forcibly free Maergary and Loras? I assume they can fight their way through the faith militant- but if they do that what does the City guard do, what do the Lannister troops do?</p>
<p>And where&#8217;s Kevan? If Tywin was alive (away but alive) you know he&#8217;d damn well beheading back to Kings Landing to put a stop to this (and possibly ship Cersei back to Casterly Rock chained up in a box if need be) Kevan&#8217;s not Tywin, but I suspect that if he comes back and gives conflicting orders to the Lannister troops- they&#8217;re following him and not Cersei.</p>

		<p>Without giving away too many spoilers, a lot of these are going to be resolved in future episodes if the show sticks even broadly to the outline of the books. </p>
<p>You&#8217;re right in that the KL story arc this season gives little explanation as to (1) how and why the FM are so popular (as Steven says it&#8217;s essentially a religious-based populist movement among refugees from the war-torn areas), (2) why Cersei is feeling so trapped by the Tyrells that she lashes out at them, (3) why she ultimately restores the FM.</p>

		<p>Fair enough, because I&#8217;ve read only the first two books. But really, IMO, though, the show has handled these developments very clumsily. Sounds like you don&#8217;t disagree on that point. If the books handled them better, well, that&#8217;s something. But I gave up on the books because I found them to be exhausting, and I just didn&#8217;t love GRRM&#8217;s prose.</p>

		<p>FYI, in the books she restores the FM in exchange for the Faith forgiving the crown&#8217;s debt to it. So her mistake there relates more to her issues with being a poor long-term strategic thinker than her vindictiveness against the Tyrells. </p>
<p>I agree that the show could have benefited from a couple more episodes of development of the religious aspects of the world before introducing the FM around episode 3-4. Introducing them through Lancel, the son of a great lord, rather than through another avenue was also a mistake.</p>

		<p>I wonder why they are in such a hurry with the show.  They are going to run out of material from the books long before the 7th one is published.  They can afford to take their time with plot developments.</p>

		<p>Yes, especially when it would not require introduction of new areas/characters. </p>
<p>This could have easily done by having Brienne and Pod meet the HS on the road &gt; he gives his speech and explains why they are marching &gt; more scenes about the Crown&#8217;s finances and the Tyrells maneuvering in KL and pointing out how the city is starving and its fed only by their grain stores &gt; maybe some scenes of protesting/rioting. Shouldn&#8217;t be too confusing to the non-book crowd. There&#8217;s simplification and oversimplification, and I think the KL storyline has strayed into the latter.</p>

		<p>All I can say is there&#8217;s no reason to stop reporting on popular culture just because it offends you. I wrote quite a bit about <em>24</em> despite the fact that the only thing that offended me about it was everything.</p>
<p>Also, as is clear from the podcast, I think the Mary Sue &#8212; which is a site I <em>love</em>, I just happen to disagree with here &#8212; is wrong about their interpretation of the scene.</p>

		<p>Quite frankly, given how common sexual assault is and how little justice there is for victims, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were quite a few survivors on staff and they were considerably more than “offended” at the show.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t doubt it, nor am I trying to minimize their argument &#8212; I just think they&#8217;re wrong. This is getting hashed out really intelligently in other places, and I&#8217;m way too tired to do it justice, but the short version is that it&#8217;s a journalist&#8217;s responsibility to report &#8212; even if they&#8217;re an entertainment journalist, as Alyssa Rosenberg, whom I&#8217;m cribbing from here, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/05/17/game-of-thrones-season-5-episode-6-review-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> &#8212; what they see, not what they&#8217;d like to.</p>
<p>Again, I respect the decision, I just disagree with it.</p>

		<p>The link you posted didn&#8217;t work, OI, but I bounced around the site until I found the article. I really couldn&#8217;t agree more. That is: I&#8217;m not sure I agree with the logic of the article but I long ago gave up watching GoT because of the violence and the extreme sadism and voyeurism it displayed towards women. The books had a lot of violence and, of course, rape but I never found those things to be in the book in a pandering or grotesque way. They weren&#8217;t there to please or seduce the reader. While in GoT the TV seriesI found that the imaginary viewer was male and he was imagined to especially enjoy female nudity, rape, and torture.  Rape wasn&#8217;t something that happened to a character because of dramatic necessity or history or culture&#8211;it was there, or displayed there in the show, because it was a cheap and easy way of helping the viewer get his sadistic rocks off.  I&#8217;m not a sadist or a voyeur so I couldn&#8217;t enjoy the show. Whereas I did enjoy the books because, to my mind, they were about politics, culture, family, war,and history&#8211;all things that interest me.</p>

		<p>Aimai, I think the article page likely crashed under the weight of the comments.<br />
<blockquote>Whereas I did enjoy the books because, to my mind, they were about politics, culture, family, war, and history–all things that interest me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are also the things that I find interesting in fantasy novels, as well as romantic love, friendship, camaraderie, other interpersonal relationships, and supernatural elements. I&#8217;m not fond of GRRM&#8217;s prose style (&#8220;Myrish swamp&#8221;&#8230; okay), and I&#8217;m aware that the books are hardly free of gruesomeness, but the show goes above and beyond them considerably.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;m truly sick of is the content-free and historically questionable defense of &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the way it was back then.&#8221; Er, that&#8217;s the way it is <i>now</i>, in many places (including some parts of the U.S., such as that in which the FLDS holds sway). I don&#8217;t read or watch fiction in order to have my inferior status in society shoved in my face, kthx. Also, and I know you know this, the idea that marriages to 12-year-olds were regularly consummated is ridiculous &#8211; people certainly knew that it would lead to stillbirth and maternal death.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t enjoy the books.  I thought Martin&#8217;s treatment of how the various female characters thought and interacted with their world lacked intelligence, awareness, planning, and agency.  Danaerys and Catelyn have their moments, as does Arya, but Brienne and Sansa were portrayed as unable to learn from their environment.  Cersei is just stupidly evil.  </p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t think Martin sees women as people.</p>

		<p>I agree. It bugs me that Martin gets lauded as an author who writes women really well. I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m not alone in thinking this!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll reserve most of my judgment until I see how this storyline plays out. We&#8217;ll see how they portray how it affects Sansa and whatnot.</p>
<p>The show does have a poor track record-with Danaerys and Cersei&#8217;s sexual assaults preceding this one. If it weren&#8217;t for those I&#8217;d be more inclined to give the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, unlike the previous two gratuitous rapes, this one actually derives from the source material and makes sense given the character. So I&#8217;m giving it a chance.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone else has to take my point of view here. I just find that I don&#8217;t regard rape scenes as at all thought provoking, or neutral, or good for character development or anything else, really.  I&#8217;ve lost my tolerance for them. They don&#8217;t fade into the background for me or serve as mere plot devices. Anymore than graphic scenes of torture do and I hasten to add that despite all the torture scenes in modern television female actresses are about 100 times more likely to be shown being raped than similarly situated main male characters are to be shown being raped or tortured (the exception is Outlander, in which Jaimie&#8217;s rape is graphically central, and Sons of Anarchy or any other prison show in which there is quite a bit of graphic male rape shown).   I just don&#8217;t want to see them and I don&#8217;t see any need for them to be shown and graphically or leadenly or lengthily played out for me visually.</p>

		<p>All of this.</p>
<p>These days, I can immerse myself in canons that do not rely on sexualized violence against women as a plot device, or offer wall-to-wall male-gazey fanservice (with much less male nudity or none at all). Also, canons in which women like Brienne of Tarth are not utter anomalies; and canons in which not everybody is straight/cis and not all the relationships are heteronormative. (More so books than TV and movies, but still.) <i>Pace</i> the Puppies, these canons do not lack in characterization, plot, or other narrative elements.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I think a significant portion of the reactions to this scene have to do with the fact that the show has zero leeway at this point when it comes to depicting rape and violence against women.  I actually do think the showrunners took on some of the criticism they got last year and were trying to implement it in this scene (though a lot will depend on whether the aftermath of the rape foregrounds Sansa or Theon), but I can&#8217;t blame fandom for being at the end of its tether.</p>

		<p>To be honest, the Daenarys change didn&#8217;t bother me.  I found it unbelievable in the books that Drogo is kind and gentle and gets consent for everything on their wedding night, and then just basically uses her like a brood mare from then on.  Also, it WAS a rape in the books. She was a child, he was a powerful warlord who basically bought her. The idea that she could meaningfully consent to sex with him was nonsense.  I thought that, issues of voyeurism aside, the show was more honest about the beginnings of that relationship.</p>

		<p>That scene is one of the few that the show got better than the book. I was a bit taken aback when I read the book and saw how they handled the consummation. Drogo&#8217;s character in every other scene is totally inconsistent with his behavior there, and Danny&#8217;s response was like creepy jailbait pr0n.</p>

		<p>Scott, I think you are basically right that Sansa went into this expecting that her marriage with Rasmsay would be consummated and expected that to be a terrible experience and <i>thought</i> she was braced for that.</p>
<p>But, it was worse than she imagined both because Ramsay is a far worse man than she could have known and perhaps she underestimated how traumatic and degrading it would be in any case. </p>
<p>In that sense, having the scene play out as a rape as opposed to having Sansa stare up at the ceiling and think of England Winterfell is a more emotionally sound take on how Sansa would experience her wedding night. Even if Ramsay were patient and gentle, it&#8217;s still a horrible violation. (Of course, Ramsay being Ramsay, patient and gentle weren&#8217;t on the table anyway.)</p>

		<p>Exactly. She knew it would be awful, but she couldn&#8217;t have predicted quite how awful, because she underestimated Ramsay &#8212; as did Littlefinger. I think that&#8217;s largely the point, that she took what he taught her, and in the end, dealt with it as best she could.</p>
<p>I think people who&#8217;ve tossed in the towel on the basis of this scene are dismissing how significant a piece of her development it is. It&#8217;s just as significant as the &#8220;soft kill&#8221; Arya performed in the episode &#8212; a scene it&#8217;s linked to, structurally. I&#8217;m &#8212; I hope <em>obviously</em> &#8212; not wishing it upon her, but I think she&#8217;s prepared for it. I mean, if you think Sansa assumed she&#8217;d go into the marriage chamber and thought they&#8217;d just cuddle, then you think less of her than I do.</p>

		<p>Sansa underestimated Ramsay&#8230; how, exactly? Sansa is a person whose father was executed by her fiance in front of her, over her explicit pleadings. She&#8217;s a person who was stripped naked in open court by said fiance. Her mother and brother were murdered&#8211;at a wedding&#8211;by the father of her new fiance. She&#8217;s had horrors described to her by the Hound. She saw flayed bodies hanging upon her return home. And so on. Basically, she&#8217;s been menaced constantly and has endured countless cruelties, and had her childhood dreams of being a fairy-tale princess crushed repeatedly and utterly. And she&#8217;s interacted enough with Ramsay to know he&#8217;s cut from the same cloth as Joffrey. </p>
<p>At this point, being bent over a bed and raped is almost certainly not as bad as she could imagine. Give her more imagination and agency.</p>

		<p>Yes to all this, but: she&#8217;s a child, and a virgin, and there are things that you can&#8217;t understand until you&#8217;ve experienced them.  I don&#8217;t doubt that Sansa understood what was coming and tried to nerve herself up to it (as many unwilling brides have done before her, sadly).  But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the experience itself wouldn&#8217;t have been a terrible one.</p>

		<p>True (though I don&#8217;t think she can rightfully be called a child, at least in the show &#8211; thankfully, the showrunners aged all of the characters). For my part, I&#8217;m in the camp that wonders why this rape was necessary at all for her character&#8217;s development, or for the story in general. </p>
<p>The issue for me is that if this event has to be there, we needed Sansa&#8217;s feelings about it. And unfortunately, the way the scene was shot, we didn&#8217;t get Sansa&#8217;s reaction to the assault at all &#8212; we got Theon&#8217;s, a loathsome character *even before* he betrayed the Starks.</p>

		<blockquote><p>She saw flayed bodies hanging upon her return home</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m petty sure those were taken down prior to her arrival&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>almost certainly not as bad as she could imagine</p></blockquote>
<p>I would assume so as well&#8230; In fact if she had actually married Joffrey I assume her wedding night would have been worse- Joff (who I assume died a virgin) would likely not have been able to &#8220;perform&#8221; and would have killed her in a humiliated (in his own mind) rage.</p>
<p>I have a friend who assumes that Tyrion is written as a stand in for GRRM, Theon is some guy who bullied/humiliated GRRM when they were both teenagers&#8230; My friend would likely say that Sansa is some girl who wouldn&#8217;t give GRRM the time of day back in middle school.</p>

		<p>OK, don&#8217;t take this the wrong way, but: I do not have a free hour in my day to listen to a conversation that would take ten minutes, tops, to read if it were transcribed.  I honestly find podcasts utterly pointless &#8211; if I have time to spend on entertainment, I&#8217;d rather it be something immersive like books or TV.</p>

		<p>This will sound strange coming from me of all people, but I completely agree. I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts &#8212; in large part because, hello? mostly deaf and listening is hard work. I prefer just reading things, I can do that much more quickly. I was just being grumpy that this was the podcast post and people were responding without having listened to it, and we addressed all those issues.</p>
<p>Also, get off my lawn, etc.</p>

		<p>One thing that didn&#8217;t come up in the podcast, that I think is interesting contrast with the books.</p>
<p>The Tyrells are actually guilty of what they are accused of here. (Not that I endorse anti-sodomy laws, or prosecuting people who perjure themselves in situations like this). As opposed to the books which rely on charges fabricated by Cersei and dependent on testimony from her cronies. </p>
<p>To my mind, that puts the Tyrells in a more desperate situation. In the books it seems the Tyrells expect Margaery expect to be vindicated at trial. That might not be true of the TV show charges.</p>
<p>A bit of wild speculation here, this might mean Loras chooses trial by combat to clear himself, perhaps going up against Robert Strong? Or would that be too close to the last trial by combat we saw?</p>
<p>As to the witness against Loras, we don&#8217;t know what else they might have on him, and I&#8217;m not sure I agree that he also will get no mercy. Didn&#8217;t Lancel confess to some pretty serious offenses and get forgiven? So I could buy that he would flip.</p>

		<p>They expect her to be vindicated at trial, sure, but that&#8217;s largely because of the 70,000 strong army parked outside the city holding up grain shipments.</p>

		<p>I was one of those who complained about the apparent lack of sense of Little Finger/Sansa plot.  I said that I hoped I was wrong, and I was delighted to discover that I was indeed wrong.</p>
<p>I am generally thick skinned, but the rape was so horrific that I couldn&#8217;t sleep afterwards.  Game of Thrones is a dark show, but the rape of Sansa seen seemed invoke such savagery simply for the sake of being shocking.  However, I will hold out hope that I am wrong in this, as I was in the Little Finger plot.</p>
<p>Still, I have to wonder at times if it&#8217;s worth it to put my self through such anguish.</p>

		<p>Rape aside, here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t like about the episode:</p>
<p>1. Why was Baelish summoned to Court? He gets an urgent message from Cersei to report immediately to King&#8217;s Landing. He does. He tells Lancel that he&#8217;s responding to an urgent summons from Cersei. Then, when he gets there, all that happens is that Petyr and Cersei discuss the fact that Loras has been imprisoned by the Faith Militant (something that hadn&#8217;t happened by the time Cersei sent her summons to Baelish) before Cersei asks &#8220;was there anything else?&#8221; Uh, Cersei, you&#8217;re the one who called the urgent meeting.</p>
<p>2. The Sand Snakes fight. If you&#8217;re going to have a chaotic fight, maybe not have everybody wear the same outfit and have the camera whip back and forth from 40 different angles. At no point in the fight could I say who had just hit who.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Why was Baelish summoned to Court? </p></blockquote>
<p>1: To provide witnesses (i.e., employees) to testify against Loras and Maergary.<br />
2: To ensure the Vale was still on the side of the Iron Throne if the relationship with the Reach/High Garden went kablooey.</p>
<p>#1 was accomplished and Cersei thinks the fact that she made LF scurry back and pledge loyalty accomplished #2 as well.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m totally buying how Baelish played Cersei. It&#8217;s actually perfect (aided by timing, but still exactly the needed push). </p>
<p>The Sand Snakes fight was a bit silly because&#8230; well, of how SMALL it seemed. A bit of a melee might have been nice. I&#8217;m gonna confess that I find the entire plot there a bit thin in terms of its execution to this moment, probably because the scenes have been so short.</p>

		<p>Completely off-topic but I want to quickly comment in a newer thread:</p>
<p>I saw Fury Road on Monday. I&#8217;m not sure what the hell people are complaining about. Based on the chatter I was expecting Theron&#8217;s character to overshadow Hardy&#8217;s Mad Max but didn&#8217;t find that to be the case at all. If anything Max seemed virtually indestructible compared to Theron&#8217;s character. Pretty damned good film for what it is. Also a very high runtime to vehicular homicide ratio.</p>

		<blockquote><p>So if you’ve never listened to this podcast and have just heard the (true) rumors that we bicker like an old Jewish married couple about Game of Thrones every week — well, it’s time to stop not-listening to us, because we managed to work through the issues with this last episode — and there are many – as adeptly as as anyone this side of Alyssa has.</p></blockquote>
