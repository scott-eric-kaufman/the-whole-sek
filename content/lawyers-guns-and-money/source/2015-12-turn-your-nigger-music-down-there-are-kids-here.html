		<p>Many years ago, I worked in a locksmith shop.  My housemate got me King Missile&#8217;s <em>Failure</em> for my birthday, so obviously work was the best place to listen to the CD for the first time.</p>
<p>Little old lady comes in.  I start making her key.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_%28King_Missile_album%29" rel="nofollow">4th track</a> comes on.  I start grinding her key really slowly, hoping I can drown out the lyrics, not knowing how long the song will be.  Finally:</p>
<blockquote><p>Little Old Lady:  Please tell me I don&#8217;t hear what I think I hear.<br />
Me:  [gives up, stops grinding] I&#8217;m afraid it is.<br />
LOL:  [shaking head] Just ring me up so I can get out of here.<br />
Me:  On the house.</p></blockquote>
<p>Point being, even  Massholes are not as rude as your dude.</p>

		<p>My undergrad faculty adviser posted to FB recently about how depressing it was that his Intro to American Government students were coming up to him and telling him how the Hamilton soundtrack was getting them interested in the topic.  I told him that Hamilton and Hamilton only would keep young people interested in 18th-century American politics for as long as Godspell and Godspell alone has kept young people interested in the Gospel of Matthew.</p>

		<p>&#8230; why the fuck would he find this depressing? Is he some kind of, like, hipster professor, who can only like things nobody else likes or has heard of?</p>
<p>Most of the professors I know would fall down weeping in gratitude at anything that got young people interested in their field of study. If there were a hit musical about labor struggles and suddenly Erik was in enormous demand from undergrads, for example, I can&#8217;t imagine he&#8217;d be anything but pleased.</p>

		<p><i>Most of the professors I know would fall down weeping in gratitude at anything that got young people interested in their field of study.</i></p>
<p>It&#8230; depends. The people who take my Asian history classes because of &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221; or &#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221; or &#8220;Memoirs of a Geisha&#8221; or &#8220;We Were Soldiers&#8221; or &#8220;Dragonball Z&#8221; or &#8220;Akira&#8221; or &#8220;Enter the Dragon&#8221; or &#8220;Gangnam Style&#8221;&#8230; </p>
<p>Well, it gets them in the door, but the cost is high. </p>
<p>That said, everything I&#8217;ve heard about &#8220;Hamilton&#8221; is that it&#8217;s really true to the spirit of things in a way that none of what I&#8217;ve cited above is. (Except maybe &#8220;Gangnam Style&#8221;)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d equate &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221; with Dragonball Z.  A fictionalized historical drama should have quite a bit more relevance than an out-and-out fantasy.</p>

		<p>Episode #31415926 of &#8220;people who know <i>almost</i> nothing try to tell me what&#8217;s going on in my classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody makes the mistake of treating &#8220;Dragonball Z&#8221; as history, which means that &#8220;Last Samurai&#8221; creates more enduring misunderstanding which actually makes learning real history harder.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Nobody makes the mistake of treating “Dragonball Z” as history</p></blockquote>
<p>Then why is it on your list.</p>
<p>Someone who signs up for your class because they saw TLS is likely to be much more receptive to your correcting their misunderstandings and raking through the cultural weeds than someone who signed up because they liked Akira and/or thought it&#8217;d be an easy distribution elective.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s entirely possible that you&#8217;re like the prof I got when I signed up for Roman Military History and the first half of the course was an in-depth exploration of the Mound cultures of Celtic Germany.  In which case, never mind.</p>

		<p><i>Someone who signs up for your class because they saw TLS is likely to be much more receptive to your correcting their misunderstandings&#8230;</i></p>
<p>People don&#8217;t work that way. &#8220;Cool Japan&#8221; and anime fans have fewer preconceptions about historical process and culture, so they don&#8217;t have to unlearn anything, and don&#8217;t take it personally when I say &#8220;that&#8217;s almost entirely wrong&#8221; whereas graduates of the Cruise/Gibson school of historical drama think they already &#8220;get it&#8221; and will mostly shoehorn anything you tell them into whatever space is left over from the movies. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to debunk. Best you can do is &#8216;flood the zone&#8217; with good information, model pragmatic epistemology, and hope they have an actual epiphany eventually.</p>

		<p>I wasn&#8217;t a teacher, but I remember having conversations about Braveheart with people that track with this, because I happened to have read a bunch about the Scottish Wars of Independence before and after the movie came out. People did not want to let go of a lot of weirdly specific things from that movie, especially in more than one case the idea that Wallace was from the Highlands and wore a kilt.</p>

		<p><em>Well, it gets them in the door, but the cost is high.</em></p>
<p>Having had the dubious pleasure of teaching Forensic Anthropology and Skeletal Analysis to undergraduate enthusiasts of <em>Bones</em> and <em>CSI: King of Prussia</em>, I&#8217;m inclined to agree.</p>

		<p>Euler(to suspect):Your alibi depends on you crossing each bridge in K&ouml;nigsburg exactly once, but my analysis shows that is impossible. I just had to invent graph theory to do it.</p>
<p>Kant (to suspect): It&#8217;s categorically imperative that you are guilty.</p>
<p>Euler(to Kant): Book him, Imanno, murder one.</p>

		<p>Because the soundtrack to a musical succeeded where a semester&#8217;s worth of effort by him failed.</p>
<p>He did later state that he was happy that it got students interested in the topic, though.</p>

		<p>My general feeling on this is that I strongly reject the idea of Hamilton as some sort of model for progressives or that he has anything particularly useful to say to people in 2015, especially given, oh I don&#8217;t know, the fucking Alien and Sedition Acts. But that anyone is talking about the past in interesting ways that creates new dimensions of public memory of our past is super interesting.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m persuaded by Yglesias&#8217; view, which is that even if Hamilton isn&#8217;t a progressive hero, it&#8217;s a welcome shift away from locating the origins of progressivism in white populist Jefferson/Jackson Democrats. So in a way it&#8217;s more valuable for making Jefferson look bad than Hamilton look good.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d expand this to a more general pronouncement that people who have been dead for more than a generation can&#8217;t be used as a useful model for anything in the present, given that the world that crafted them into someone noteworthy is as dead as they are. So whatever model they supposedly provide is automatically obsolete at the very moment of its creation.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t go that far. For example, my impression of Thomas Paine (maybe erroneous, I definitely have big gaps in my knowledge of him) has always been that even today he deserves to be valorized and serves as a pretty passable model.</p>

		<p>This sounds awfully close to saying &#8220;it&#8217;s impossible to learn anything meaningfully applicable to the present from history because the background conditions have changed.&#8221; I think even if you don&#8217;t want to go full &#8220;those who don&#8217;t learn from history, doomed, etc.&#8221; that&#8217;s still a very radical epistemological claim.</p>

		<blockquote><p>This sounds awfully close to saying “it’s impossible to learn anything meaningfully applicable to the present from history because the background conditions have changed.” I think even if you don’t want to go full “those who don’t learn from history, doomed, etc.” that’s still a very radical epistemological claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not what I&#8217;m claiming.</p>
<p>The value of &#8220;learning from history&#8221; entails, to my mind, reconstructing the foundations of the present. History tells us how things got the way they are, and that is supremely valuable in formulating what comes after, but it in no way does that work all by itself. That those who don&#8217;t learn from history seemed doomed to repeat it is not because history is unchanging and/or cyclical, but because they have no clue where they are, and thus can&#8217;t determine where they need to go. It&#8217;s not surprising that a house built without a foundation will soon collapse in on itself.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m arguing is that, to continue with Hamilton as an example, Hamilton has nothing useful to say about the present because he isn&#8217;t in the present. Even if we could draw reasonable conclusions about what he would think about any given present controversy, he will neither bear the responsibility of implementing his supposed recommendations nor be accountable if those recommendations don&#8217;t produce the intended result. And I think the kind of presentism that would point to him as a source for any kind of solution is designed to do exactly that, because it works as a kind of appeal to authority; it helps us evade responsibility and accountability for the decisions we make in the here and now, because we get to attribute those things to someone we think of as wise but who is ultimately too stone fucking dead to protest.</p>

		<p>I think we can still learn important things about ourselves and the present by looking at historical figures, not because their actions tell us how we ought to act, but because they can be important examples and role models of more durable human types, good, bad, and questionable. Trying to understand someone with a complicated, unclaimed history like Hamilton, a Magnificent Bastard like Napoleon or Caesar, or a Great Virtuous Hero like Washington or Lincoln can help us to </p>
<p>-understand the motivations of people who aren&#8217;t like us, like a great novel would do;<br />
-understand the flaws of people who are otherwise great, like a great novel would do;<br />
-deconstruct tropes that we use to construct simple, pat narratives in order to achieve a more complex and mature narrative, like a (I&#8217;m noticing a pattern here);<br />
-better understand the past and how we got to the present, as you said.</p>
<p>These serve functions that can be grouped under both moral and practical lessons.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just operating on a more expansive definition of &#8220;something useful to say about the present.&#8221; I obviously don&#8217;t care much about the particulars of what Hamilton thought about national monetary policy, because the particulars have changed so much, but I do care why he thought what he thought given the context of the times, and even just going one layer down we can still learn that I&#8217;d consider &#8220;practical.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I may be wildly off the mark here, but I never really got that hung up on the Alien and Sedition Acts. Not that they weren&#8217;t bad, but they came at a time when the country was young and conceivably vulnerable to being reconquered by European powers, and more broadly liberal democracy was a pretty nascent thing. I mean at the same time Madison was pushing the opprtunistic argument that individual states could nullify federal law.</p>

		<p>They seem like the first example in a long and ignoble American tradition of government officials rather nakedly passing laws mainly in their personal political interest (the Federalists upset about being criticized by the Democratic Republicans press and that immigrants were unlikely to vote for anti-immigrant Federalists) and justifying them with rather nebulous claims about national security.</p>

		<p>My feeling about this (which is also how I square some of the difficulties raised by the show&#8217;s race-swapped casting and musical style) is that <i>Hamilton</i> is much more about the present moment than it is about its historical subject.  Yes, Miranda is clearly impressed and deeply admiring of Hamilton, but the things he identifies as admirable about him &#8211; and highlights and exaggerates in the play &#8211; are filtered through his present-based political concerns.  Which is, obviously, as it should be, and doesn&#8217;t keep the play from being an interesting primer about an interesting person&#8217;s life.</p>

		<p>Good thing Scott is white. Remember the white guy who killed a black kid for playing rap too loud at a gas pump (around the time of the Trayvon trial)? Wasn&#8217;t he acquitted because his &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; defense was that loud rap music was &#8220;threatening?</p>

		<p>This is the first I&#8217;ve heard of this ongoing discussion &#8212; admittedly, I haven&#8217;t been around as much as I used to be &#8212; but I do normally censor such words (<a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/12/07/fox_news_contributor_calls_obama_a_total_pssy_in_unhinged_rant_about_presidents_terrorism_speech/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>e.g.</em></a>), but in this case, the inherent contradiction in the statement was the point, so I wanted to keep its rhetorical power intact.</p>

		<p>Rhetorical power to what effect? With what audience in mind?  </p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not casting aspersions, but there are about two million other ways to frame that exchange —  even leaving the excerpt completely, faithfully intact (&#8220;nigger&#8221; and all) —  that isn&#8217;t just bam wow in your face n-bomb every time I look at the post and see a response to it. Who&#8217;s that supposed to shock exactly and how? Why is the presence of shock, effect or worse a value worth cultivating in this context?</p>

		<p>Because we&#8217;re living in a historical moment in which liberals and leftists, a.k.a. most of the readers of this site, can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possibly getting as bad as it is, no matter <a href="http://www.salon.com/writer/scott_eric_kaufman/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">how many articles I write about Donald Trump</a> and his old school xenophobia. (Seriously, that&#8217;s five today before I had to step out, I think.) </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s important to remind this particular audience that things are degenerating both at the macro/political level <em>and</em> the micro/interpersonal one, such that it&#8217;s apparently appropriate to use the word &#8220;nigger&#8221; in front of children, but not listen to a musical about the Founding Fathers because it sounds like black music. </p>
<p>I see your point that it can be used indiscriminately, but I don&#8217;t use it in that manner. When I want to highlight a particularly powerful piece of racist nonsense that includes it, I&#8217;m going to go with the direct quotation, because the whole point isn&#8217;t to water it down, but to remind people of awfulness that exists in the increasingly perilous now.</p>

		<p>But your conception of useful, anti-racist white liberal/white leftism is deliberately and intentionally about centering the concerns, politics and emotional/political movement of white people only. Why is something that derives its political utility on the absence of black people from consideration <em>also</em> something that can qualify as sufficiently anti-racist? Especially when the lesson this post supposedly teaches is one that many black people already know and have experience with.</p>
<p>And, I&#8217;m sorry, but why is that anecdote powerful to you? At whose expense is this power derived? And why is mere documentation of its existence and condemnation of its existence being presented as challenging? Much of the inspiration for your condemnation hinges on the person&#8217;s use of a racial slur. Do you think white liberals and leftists know not to say that in polite company? Even I&#8217;m, within certain parameters, willing to concede that much. So even under the best case situation of your posts effect, what use is it serving? What is it challenging that most people here don&#8217;t already think (it has southerners are the Real Scary Racists, &#8220;nigger&#8221; as the coup de grace of racism, old white person hating rap, etc). Nothing here is controversial, except for your use of that word, which affects at least one member of an audience that wasn&#8217;t considered when the post was made. </p>
<p>You would challenge far more about this place if you made more of a habit of talking about, engaging with and linking non-Hamilton hip hop/rap. I mean, I can&#8217;t promise I&#8217;d want to read it, but it would at least be addressing a noticeable absence here. This post, though? Nah.</p>

		<p><em>But your conception of useful, anti-racist white liberal/white leftism is deliberately and intentionally about centering the concerns, politics and emotional/political movement of white people only.</em></p>
<p>I have no idea why you think I think I&#8217;m focusing on white people only &#8212; I&#8217;m pointing out an example of white racism, couched in a causal encounter. This is what I do, quite a bit of the time now, ground larger politics in the stuff of everyday life. Of course, that life&#8217;s <em>mine</em>, and the people I feel compelled to mock on the Internet are those with whom I vehemently disagree, not allies. </p>
<p><em>Especially when the lesson this post supposedly teaches is one that many black people already know and have experience with.</em></p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve argued or implied otherwise? </p>
<p><em>Much of the inspiration for your condemnation hinges on the person’s use of a racial slur.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve missed the point, which wasn&#8217;t the use of the slur itself. I was 1) pointing out the irony that his supposedly Christian values, which were of course present nowhere in his remarks, were fundamentally undercut by the music that inspired them. And 2) I was noting that apparently &#8220;nigger&#8221; is a word that can be used in the presence of children, but anything that even resembles &#8220;black&#8221; music is inherently inappropriate. </p>
<p><em>You would challenge far more about this place if you made more of a habit of talking about, engaging with and linking non-Hamilton hip hop/rap.</em></p>
<p>I have in the past, quite a bit in fact. I think you&#8217;re just not that familiar with me. (I don&#8217;t recognize your name either, so don&#8217;t take that as a judgment or anything, just a statement of fact.) I can&#8217;t think of any other reason you&#8217;d claim that I haven&#8217;t written extensively written about race &#8212; I certainly did so when I was teaching my &#8220;Race and Community in American Literature&#8221; courses, given my tendency to post what I was teaching about. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the fact that my day job currently consists of <a href="http://www.salon.com/topic/islamophobia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">writing endlessly about racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia</a>. I&#8217;m just saying, it&#8217;s fundamentally unfair for you to judge my entire outlook on race from a single post.</p>

		<blockquote><p>I have no idea why you think I think I’m focusing on white people only — I’m pointing out an example of white racism, couched in a causal encounter.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s possible I&#8217;m being unfair and if I am, I do apologize but this quote: </p>
<blockquote><p>Because we’re living in a historical moment in which liberals and leftists, a.k.a. most of the readers of this site, can’t believe it’s possibly getting as bad as it is, no matter how many articles I write about Donald Trump and his old school xenophobia. (Seriously, that’s five today before I had to step out, I think.)</p>
<p>I think it’s important to remind this particular audience that things are degenerating both at the macro/political level and the micro/interpersonal one, such that it’s apparently appropriate to use the word “nigger” in front of children, but not listen to a musical about the Founding Fathers because it sounds like black music. </p></blockquote>
<p>only makes any kind of sense if you&#8217;re talking about white people. There are very few people of color that aren&#8217;t intimately aware of any of this and have spent the last&#8230;forever organizing and politically/socially reacting to both this possibility and the particulars of their oppression. We&#8217;re kind of drowning in reminders. What does merely adding to those reminders bring to the table? Why do you think reproducing a racial slur with a pretty unremarkable example of too-easily-objected-to racism (that white, middle class liberal sophisticates can easily separate themselves from and take heart that They&#8217;re Not Like That) is functioning as a useful reminder? Who is it reminding? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not doubting your record. As far as I&#8217;m aware I haven&#8217;t really commented on your writing outside of your post and comments here. What I&#8217;m doubting is the utility of this post, here. What I&#8217;m skeptical of is how fully black audiences were considered in its conception and if they were&#8230;well, what do you think you&#8217;re telling black people, really?</p>

		<p><em>only makes any kind of sense if you’re talking about white people.</em></p>
<p>Pointing out that I believe the situation is degenerating doesn&#8217;t entail a belief that it hasn&#8217;t always been bad. (As I&#8217;ve said time and time again, I grew up a Jew in Louisiana, I was considered &#8220;black&#8221; until I reached college.) I&#8217;m saying that based on my considerable experience with Southern racists, I&#8217;m finding that certain sections of the population who were once only racist behind closed doors are now emboldened, and that that the wording of the phrase atop this post &#8212; which isn&#8217;t in &#8220;bold,&#8221; as you claimed, it&#8217;s just the &#8220;headline&#8221; font &#8212; captures this increase in entitlement in a single phrase. </p>
<p>That said, am I a fan of works that encourage white audiences to encounter the everyday experiences of black Americans? <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/lessons_from_the_beast_side_imagine_how_the_cops_would_have_reacted_if_a_hate_spewing_black_extremist_had_shot_up_a_white_church/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I most certainly am</a>. I also <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/07/17/david_brooks_scolds_ta_nehisi_coates_i_think_you_distort_history/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">support works whose intended audience are explicitly non-white</a>. I support them both. So even if this post only addresses the former, so what? </p>
<p>At worst, it&#8217;s merely evidence that <em>in this particular post</em>, I had a white audience in mind instead of a black one. In another post or book review or commentary on a book review, the exact opposite will be true. You can&#8217;t infer the totality of a person&#8217;s belief from a single post &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m saying this, it should go without saying.</p>
<p><em>What I’m skeptical of is how fully black audiences were considered in its conception and if they were…well, what do you think you’re telling black people, really?</em></p>
<p>I hate talking about abstract &#8220;black people.&#8221; If you want to know how the black people I know and am friends with, it&#8217;s not that difficult to do &#8212; I&#8217;m a public figure, have been quoted and linked by many a colleague, some of whom happen to be black, some Latino, some Hispanic, some transgender, some queer, etc. That&#8217;s all out there for public consumption, and I write about these issues <em>every single day</em>. It&#8217;s a bit absurd to be accused of being insufficiently concerned with the very people whose respective causes I spend all day trying to advance. </p>
<p>(And if this comes off as belligerent, I apologize, but I wake up at 4 a.m. daily and have usually stopped writing/commenting <em>long</em> before whatever time it is at the moment.)</p>

<p>If saying that I&#8217;m part of a larger media conversation that includes all the people I listed, and that I&#8217;m attuned to the concerns of the communities they represent, as evidenced by the fact that there&#8217;s an abundance of proof in the form of my interaction with them online, then yes, I&#8217;m saying &#8220;some of my best friends are black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Leaving aside the number of things I&#8217;m incredibly tempted to respond to but won&#8217;t, let me highlight this: </p>
<blockquote><p>That said, am I a fan of works that encourage white audiences to encounter the everyday experiences of black Americans?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>So even if this post only addresses the former, so what? </p></blockquote>
<p>First off, some white dude using &#8220;nigger music&#8221; with you is not a black experience, because you aren&#8217;t black, and didn&#8217;t react like a black person, but reacted like a non-black person who encountered an anti-black ethnic slur. In fact, the freedom he probably felt saying that was likely inspired both by your presumed whiteness, by a similarly presumed kinship therein and by the expectation &#8211; borne out by your anecdote &#8211; that no consequences or challenge would be visited on him for using it. </p>
<p>Secondly, if I&#8217;ve observed your motives and target audience for this post accurately &#8220;so what&#8221; is best filled in by &#8220;so I decided to use an anti-black ethnic slur in a post title that will be reproduced, specifically to comment to white people and with limited consideration for how and whether black people will be offended by it and with no responsibility to mute or cushion that effect&#8221;.</p>

		<p><em>First off, some white dude using “nigger music” with you is not a black experience, because you aren’t black, and didn’t react like a black person, but reacted like a non-black person who encountered an anti-black ethnic slur.</em></p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re just arguing dishonestly. You quoted me discussing D. Watkins&#8217; <em><a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/lessons_from_the_beast_side_imagine_how_the_cops_would_have_reacted_if_a_hate_spewing_black_extremist_had_shot_up_a_white_church/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Beast Side</a></em>, then argued that that&#8217;s what I was attempting to do with this post. It wasn&#8217;t, and you either 1) know that and willfully ignored it or 2) can&#8217;t follow an argument, and in both cases lead me to conclude that you aren&#8217;t worth engaging with. </p>
<p><em>if I’ve observed your motives and target audience for this post accurately “so what” is best filled in by “so I decided to use an anti-black ethnic slur in a post title that will be reproduced, specifically to comment to white people and with limited consideration for how and whether black people will be offended by it and with no responsibility to mute or cushion that effect”</em></p>
<p>First, you can reference a slur without &#8220;using&#8221; it, which is bog-obvious but I&#8217;ll mention it anyway. Second, you&#8217;re condemning a condemnation for being offensive &#8212; which was the point, audience be damned. As I wrote elsewhere, and which you ignored, if Donald Trump declares &#8220;let&#8217;s not worry about the nigger vote,&#8221; that quotation&#8217;s going in the headline unadulterated because it&#8217;s warranted. Third, you claim I had &#8220;limited consideration for how and whether black people will be offended by it and with no responsibility to mute or cushion that effect,&#8221; about which I can say, quite simply, <em>bullshit</em>. </p>
<p>I considered it &#8212; such considerations are my day job, after all, it&#8217;d be strange for me to suddenly <em>not</em> consider them here &#8212; and this whole comment thread is evidence of me taking responsibility for your having been offended. Hell, despite the fact that I&#8217;m inclined to believe you&#8217;re arguing in bad faith, this comment thread is probably instructive to a number of the people reading it, and I&#8217;m fine with that. It&#8217;s the suggestion that I&#8217;m causally throwing out profanities for reasons other than condemnation that&#8217;s the problem. You want to impute ill-intent, despite the fact that you&#8217;ve repeatedly proven you know absolutely nothing about me &#8212; which just from an argumentative perspective is a piss-poor strategy.</p>

		<p><em>That’s precisely what that is, but I’m not saying anything else about that right now.</em></p>
<p>Yes, saying that I belong to a larger conversation that includes members of the black community &#8212; and that there&#8217;s abundant evidence of this available to anyone privileged enough to have access to Google &#8212; is exactly the same thing as saying &#8220;some of my best friends are black.&#8221; </p>
<p><em><b>EDITED TO ADD:</b> Saying I actively support and do my damnedest raise the profile of <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/07/27/group_calls_for_black_womens_equal_pay_day_to_call_attention_to_wage_gap_between_between_black_women_white_men/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">groups like this</a> isn&#8217;t the same thing as saying &#8220;some of my best friends are black.&#8221; How y&#8217;all have twisted a fairly obvious point into a clichéd attack on anyone who defends themselves against charges of &#8220;not listening to black voices&#8221; would be beyond me, if I didn&#8217;t think it was just bad faith.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve clearly clicked on none of the links I&#8217;ve provided, nor gone to any effort to familiarize with my work over the course of this conversation, because you&#8217;re intent on Winning An Argument On The Internet. There&#8217;s a line at which &#8220;bad faith argument&#8221; crosses into &#8220;outright trolling.&#8221; You&#8217;d do best to figure out where it is and not cross it.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Now you’re just arguing dishonestly. You quoted me discussing D. Watkins’ The Beast Side, then argued that that’s what I was attempting to do with this post.

<p>Your point was that you address and support addressing two separate audiences. You went on to say that if this post addresses the former (which I took to mean the <em>former audience</em>), &#8220;so what&#8221;? Now you can say I&#8217;m mistaken and that my English is poor and that my ability to follow arguments is poorer, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an especially unreasonable leap to make. I&#8217;m not trying to be dishonest.</p>
<p>As for the rest, I suppose instead of saying that your consideration isn&#8217;t reflected in your work, I&#8217;ll simply say that the premises you&#8217;re using to define and express consideration seem unnecessarily handicapped. You&#8217;re delegating situations where it&#8217;s both A) Cool for a white person to post the word, merely for effect and not for a <em>necessary</em> reproduction/quote of some kind of anecdote, statement (where self-censoring is still pretty easy and perfectly considerate) B) Where the effect of seeing the word is sufficiently cushioned not by efforts at minimizing the impact (which would be embodied by not having a prominent post using the word &#8220;nigger&#8221; for one), by situations that you, a white person are deeming more or less objectionable and C) Where the supposed shock/effect of its use sees the possibility that black people may be less shocked and more irked/annoyed/hurt/angered by it is an adequate price, because the post is powerful&#8230;in a way that doesn&#8217;t seem attentive to how normal the use of that kind of language is in some arenas. And I just find that whole line of argument &#8211; which could be a consequence of baggage I&#8217;m perhaps unnecessarily bringing to this argument &#8211; to be immensely problematic <em>at best</em>. </p>
<p>And the reason I&#8217;m ignoring your Trump story is because making up a Trump quote where you get to freely throw around a term I clearly object to non-frivolous/necessary use of from white people isn&#8217;t really cute to me (and honestly, I&#8217;d rather white people just never use it at all). It&#8217;s just a white person using nigger to me. Just as this blog post was. And you can hem and haw and tell me how this is totally different, but as with most uses of the word by white people in contexts where I&#8217;m not adequately braced, it feels exactly the same and is exactly the same. The technicality you think is making it more moral and defensible is doing neither.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I still don&#8217;t know what was powerful about this.</p>

		<p>Oh, I see the problem. You think I&#8217;m talking about your entire work instead of this post and the points you&#8217;ve made here. Except for the black best friend aside, I&#8217;m not, so you shouldn&#8217;t feel the need to drop or defend your record as such. Everything I&#8217;m saying is about this post and your comments here.</p>

		<p><em>situations that you, a white person</em></p>
<p>I wonder how many more times I can mention, explicitly, that Jews aren&#8217;t considered white in the South before it sinks in and you realize that I&#8217;m not writing from the perspective you repeatedly assume me to be. </p>
<p><em>the reason I’m ignoring your Trump story is because making up a Trump quote where you get to freely throw around a term I clearly object to non-frivolous/necessary use of from white people isn’t really cute to me</em></p>
<p>Yes, an example of a situation in which the reproduction of a racial epithet is <em>clearly</em> inapplicable to a discussion in which you&#8217;ve questioned my intentions behind reproducing a racial epithet. Here&#8217;s the problem, and why you can&#8217;t even recognize that your &#8220;argument,&#8221; such as it is, amounts to little more than your personal preference:</p>
<p><em>It’s just a white person using nigger to me.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re arguing that white people can&#8217;t use the word, not even in condemnation, and impute ill-intent to those who make a deliberate, considered decision to use the word in a quoted context in which its usage is clearly and manifestly intended to condemn. So you&#8217;re saying that any usage of the word, even when quoted, is unacceptable if the person &#8220;using&#8221; it &#8212; which, to repeat a point you&#8217;ve repeatedly missed, wasn&#8217;t me &#8212; is someone you believe, rightly or no, to be white. </p>
<p>Which is the height of arguing in bad faith, pretending that there&#8217;s a situation in which its usage would be warranted when you actually believe there isn&#8217;t. So this conversation that we&#8217;re having right now is over, at least from my side. You can continue it, if you so desire, but if you continue to not-call-me-a-racist-in-so-many-words, your comments won&#8217;t last the night, and are probably better left unwritten.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re making generalizations about my intentions, my level of consideration, my desire to take responsibility for my words, all from <em>a single post</em>, and you wonder why I claim you&#8217;re arguing in bad faith?

		<p>Sigh. </p>
<p>All right. If reducing my arguments to personal preference, calling me a dishonest Fox News caricature, threatening to delete my comments etc is fine, then let me just say (hopefully without deletion or banning) that it is my personal preference that a non-black person refrain from using the word &#8220;nigger&#8221;. I say that, not because I&#8217;m paying you and not because I assume you&#8217;re my personal writer, but because I don&#8217;t really feel like seeing that word openly and unnecessarily (personal preference) posted in a place I frequent, by someone I know isn&#8217;t black. I think it&#8217;s incredibly disrespectful in any number of ways. It&#8217;s taken differently by me and it is different. There&#8217;s lots of anti-black racism that I confront rather often, and even in contexts where you&#8217;re using it neutrally and acceptably (by your argument), encountering its use from non-black parties isn&#8217;t fun to read or to think through and it has associations beyond just whether you&#8217;re using the word with all due diligence and moral correctness. Again, to me.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t called you a racist, I made as forthright of an effort as I can muster to address your arguments (as I interpreted them, with all due personal limitations) and you can take or leave what I said, as you will. I don&#8217;t think my preferences are rendered invalid by them being personal, but there&#8217;s only so much you can do in marginalized political contexts.</p>
<p>Edit: It must also be said that, again, to me, in a non-abstract way, that whatever power and shock was supposed to be derived by this post didn&#8217;t really have that effect on me.</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;ve made that abundantly clear.</p>
<blockquote><p>It must also be said that, again, to me, in a non-abstract way, that whatever power and shock was supposed to be derived by this post didn’t really have that effect on me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything on the Internet is not targeted at you, and your sensibilities are not entitled to be given any more consideration than mine are.  Which is none, even though you are a member of an oppressed minority and I am not.  Nevertheless, I&#8217;m sure that in future SEK will remember this incident on some level and it probably will affect his decision on what he uses for blog post titles.  So mission accomplished, you registered your protest and it is (more or less) acknowledged.  Let us move on.</p>

		<p>Okay, I had been busy being mad about some other part of Lawyers Guns and Money, but </p>
<p>SEK, you actually *are* being kind of out-of-bounds here, holy shit.</p>
<p>I mean, I wasn&#8217;t exactly triggered by the title, I mean, I *had* gotten where you were coming from.  However, I also just didn&#8217;t think very much of it, not least because *I don&#8217;t want to think much of it*.  The difference between me and Drexciya isn&#8217;t so much that we have  particularly different opinions so much as having different priorities and different thickness of &#8220;skin&#8221;.</p>
<p>And then I see you do that white liberal &#8220;(IANAR)flip your lid&#8221; over what is a pretty reasonable remonstration&#8211;that there be more of a useful point when using a hurtful word.  And just dig your ass downwards&#8230;</p>

		<p>Nah. Drexciya&#8217;s been a mess in this thread and SEK&#8217;s irritation is completely justified.  Drexciya said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You would challenge far more about this place if you made more of a habit of talking about, engaging with and linking non-Hamilton hip hop/rap. I mean, I can’t promise I’d want to read it, but it would at least be addressing a noticeable absence here. This post, though? Nah.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which SEK said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I  have in the past, quite a bit in fact. I think you’re just not that familiar with me. (I don’t recognize your name either, so don’t take that as a judgment or anything, just a statement of fact.) I can’t think of any other reason you’d claim that I haven’t written extensively written about race — I certainly did so when I was teaching my “Race and Community in American Literature” courses, given my tendency to post what I was teaching about.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then shortly later Drexciya said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, I see the problem. You think I’m talking about your entire work instead of this post and the points you’ve made here. Except for the black best friend aside, I’m not, so you shouldn’t feel the need to drop or defend your record as such. Everything I’m saying is about this post and your comments here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once Drexciya started to suggest to SEK what he should or could write about in the future, he opened the door to a discussion of what SEK has written about in the past. (I can&#8217;t resist pointing out Drexciya had the gall to suggest topics for SEK while admitting he might not actually be interested in what SEK had to say about that topic.) </p>
<p>And yet later, when Drexciya decided that SEK&#8217;s history was not really helpful to his own argument, he acted as though he had never expanded the discussion beyond &#8220;this post&#8221; by (presumptuously, I think) telling him what he could or should write about in the future. He can&#8217;t suggest topics to SEK and then try to claim its irrelevant when SEK discusses his treatment of those and related topics in the past.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s not really fair. My only points with the quoted first paragraph is that a lot of the music posted here isn&#8217;t recent black music. That&#8217;s not about SEK specifically, it&#8217;s just about the environment, which he made a specific point of going out of his way to say he wanted to challenge. Posting a political hip hop song is way, way more useful than&#8230;whatever this post was. </p>
<p>It had nothing to do with SEK&#8217;s anti-racist efforts, his Salon posts, whether or not he&#8217;s a good ally, whether or not he&#8217;s talked about black people before or whatever else was included in his responses. It&#8217;s such an irrelevant aside on my part that I&#8217;m ok with retracting the whole thing with all due apologies, but I&#8217;m not quite willing to say that comment is sufficient for the depth of the defense he gave. I cast no particular aspersions, I didn&#8217;t call him a racist, I didn&#8217;t question his anti-racist bonafides, I attempted &#8211; perhaps unclearly and poorly &#8211; to question his priorities here, with this post, and whether/what it means to consider a black audience when constructing his posts and titles. It was a very narrow focus, or at least it tried to be. </p>
<p>It could have went many other ways.</p>
<p>Edit: And I made that one remark because he kept bringing up his long record in ways that were, to my mind, asides from the focus of my arguments. I didn&#8217;t think I did anything to provoke the degree of defensiveness I got, none of my comments were as broad as he took them, so I just assumed there was confusion about where my focus was.</p>

		<p>Gotta agree with shah8 on this on and with some of drexciya&#8217;s complaints above. The post would make no difference minus the slur (as I&#8217;m reading this, it&#8217;s been changed) and the threats of deletion are contemptible. Being able to read a lefty blog without reading the most hurtful racial slur in the post titles doesn&#8217;t seem like the most unreasonable request.</p>

		<p>If anyone is still reading at this point, I agree with Drex, Shah, and WC. I could probably create an &#8220;Offended White Liberal Privilege&#8221; bingo card out of SEK&#8217;s responses.</p>

		<p>Drex, you get so much shit here, but you do really good work, and I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s so thankless.</p>
<p>SEK, it was really cool that you changed the post title, also you&#8217;re great. (ETA: I didn&#8217;t see the rest of the replies before I wrote this, not your finest hour, but I&#8217;m glad you changed the title, that was cool.)</p>

		<p>I suppose &#8220;n****r music&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have the same emotional impact because&#8230;</p>

		<p>I guess we&#8217;re going to be dense and pretend like the word isn&#8217;t in bold, black letters, near the top of the blog and that the word isn&#8217;t reproduced on the sidebar, every time a comment is posted and that both of these things are magical constructs from the ether and not deliberate decisions that, as SEK noted, were made for effect.</p>

		<p>Of course not, he&#8217;s just here to point out how racist the blog is.  Addressing the actual content would distract from his mission.</p>
<p>Although complaining that the post title is triggering is a bit strange, since it is quite obviously intended to be triggering&#8211;as SEK observes, it loses its power to shock if you edit the word.</p>
<p>LGM doesn&#8217;t claim to be a safe space&#8211;trying to force it to be one is rather rude.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;re fucking blog commenters here. None of us is entirely without bees in our bonnet. Drexciya&#8217;s bee is saying the racial stuff out loud. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re probably right that that word hits harder with some black people. If not putting it in the headline means black commenters will feel better on this blog, then it shouldn&#8217;t be in the headline.</p>

		<p><em>If not putting it in the headline means black commenters will feel better on this blog, then it shouldn’t be in the headline.</em></p>
<p>In what is now my long career of writing-things-on-the-Internet, I&#8217;ve never found that to be the case so long as the usage was warranted. Is that a judgment call on my part? Of course. But I&#8217;m not going to allow someone I don&#8217;t know, someone who&#8217;s clearly unfamiliar with me, my work, and my history, tell me that if Donald Trump says &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we were never going to win the nigger vote&#8221; I shouldn&#8217;t include that quotation unadulterated in the headline. Causal usage is despicable, but that shouldn&#8217;t prevent us from condemning its despicable usage when we encounter it.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re correct, I don&#8217;t accept it. When a white person types out and posts the word &#8220;nigger&#8221;, they&#8217;re not possessed by a ghost, they&#8217;re making a specific, stylistic and political choice. And that choice has a few non-racist arguments, but I don&#8217;t have to pretend to agree with them or pretend to agree with them in all circumstances or think that choice served a specifically empathetic or attentive purpose <em>here</em>. And do note, I limited my objection to the title. I left my ambivalence about the use of the term in the quote alone and have said nothing negative about it, to my recollection.</p>

		<p>There was a recent controversy about Obama with the use/mention distinction.</p>
<p>Thing was, it&#8217;s harder to grasp what Obama is saying if he didn&#8217;t explicitly say it (i.e., nondeniability of the impact) and the context where he said it was rich, appropriately situational, and part of conveying empathetic language.</p>
<p>SEK doesn&#8217;t really do any of that stuff.  It boils down to merely a joke, and you know, this tends to be a problem with a lot of white comedians, like Amy Schumer who use racism etc, etc, to make something &#8220;funny&#8221;, rather than *be* funny in the genuine linguistically creative way.</p>

<p>Put differently, Obama&#8217;s usage (both because he&#8217;s black and because of the context of which his blackness is a part) was a validation of efforts to both empathetically summarize black thinking on racism and view it with more complexity and accountability than whether or not white people are upholding shamefully low standards of propriety. It was both empathetic and affirming &#8211; two qualities about Obama&#8217;s commentary on black people that&#8217;s too frequently in short and/or ambivalent supply.</p>
<p>A mere reproduction of racism from a party that racism is not discussing is incapable of possessing the same virtue, if it possesses any at all.</p>

		<blockquote><p>I think it’s pretty widely accepted that mention isn’t a very strong defence against the potential problems of using derogatory terms. At least, in the philosophy of language and of derogatory terms circles I knew.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s mentions and there&#8217;s mentions.  A (sincerely or maliciously) decontextualized mention&mdash;I mean, one where the speaker/writer is (or is feigning to be) handling the derogatory term with tongs at arms&#8217; length for examination and study &#8220;in the abstract&#8221;&mdash;seems to me (somewhat paradoxically) to be the <i>least</i> defensible kind of mention.  (Here, &#8220;in the abstract&#8221; would I think include made-up examples of usage.)  A mention like SEK&#8217;s in the body of the post is, I think, highly defensible: because it&#8217;s very contextualized, and is serving not only (and not, even, principally) as an object of study itself, but also as <i>primary evidence</i> (of how the person being quoted is <i>using</i> the derogatory term).  </p>
<p>A mention like SEK&#8217;s in the <i>headline</i> of the post can&#8217;t be (directly) defended on the latter ground, and indeed I don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s nearly as defensible (nor that it&#8217;s nearly as indefensible as a decontextualized&mdash;particularly a decontextualized-to-be-clevely-naughty&mdash;mention).</p>
<p>But your p-o-l and d-t circles are certainly of higher quality than what would pass for mine.</p>

		<blockquote><p>I was agreeing with his agreement, but it doesn’t much matter in this thread, so I whatever’d it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I took that. I only pointed this out because rea was repeatedly falling into a comment trap of overvaluing the use/mention distinction, as if it was dispositive here (and told against Drex&#8217;s argument). I thought it might be helpful, a bit, but it would be very much on the margins :)</p>
<p>So, thanks Gregor, I appreciate your concern, but I think Drex and I were in good synch here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just add that even though it got a bit tense, I&#8217;m glad that the title of the post was changed. I found it uncomfortable to have comments with my name attached in the side part with that title. This is obviously a very minor discomfort comparatively, but I think it shows that we often can&#8217;t fully control these things and there are risks involved.</p>
<p>WRT Lee&#8217;s comment, I think a key point is that the interesting feature about mention is that it is a mechanism for coining names about pieces of language. The classic example is (using single quotes for mention), &#8220;&#8216;House&#8217; has 5 letters.&#8221; If you read the quotes as scare quotes, then you have nonsense. If you read them as mention quotes, then you have a truth. But there are other ways of forming names for terms, including stipulation. &#8220;In what follows let &#8216;the h-word&#8217; refer to the word &#8216;house&#8217;. The h-word has 5 letters.&#8221; Obviously, mention based names are useful because they involve much less indirection. Similarly, a lot of issues can arise because of that (esp. in speech, but even in writing) lack of distance. Both speaker&#8217;s meaning and conversational implicatures are obvious ways that using a mention-name can have effects. And obviously, one reason Scott used quotation without censorship was that it affected the emotional impact of the writing. However, there are a number of implicatures made (or not made) that come from using the mention version, esp. prominently: E.g., that one is comfortable enough with that term to use the mention version. </p>
<p>(Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s long speech in Pulp Fiction comes to mind. Yes, it was a character and not him. But, I can&#8217;t help feel that there was something odd about it. The speech is pretty bad and he delivers it mediocrely at best. The exchange is long It interrupts the flow. It requires two far superior actors (one of whom is black!) to give up screen time and some force of character. I have trouble beliving that Jimmie would waste that time with two blood covered hit men in his house. I have no idea why Jules is so deferential to Jimmie. Etc.</p>
<p>It felt like wish fulfilment. It maybe would have worked with a different actor, but Tarantino gave it to himself.)</p>

		<p><em>&#8221; Why is the presence of shock, effect or worse a value worth cultivating in this context?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>because (and I have no reason to doubt SEK&#8217;s remembrance of the incident) that is what the man said. we should be shocked, that in 2015, 150 years after the end of the war that was supposed to end all that, this man still feels perfectly comfortable using that ugly word in public, to someone he doesn&#8217;t even know.</p>
<p>you should damn well be shocked by that.</p>

		<p>He&#8217;s saying only white people think that&#8217;s unusual, and that typifying it as an exemplary encounter of ultra-racism is a convenient means of reducing and containing the scope of racism, perhaps in the guise of/even with the intent of, highlighting the supposedly unique power of this incident, which may only contain a charge of power for more innocent white audiences. At least, that&#8217;s what I take him to be saying. I don&#8217;t really agree with the extent of his case, but there&#8217;s a reason he&#8217;s saying it&#8217;s not shocking.</p>

		<p>I think Drexciya&#8217;s point is that he&#8217;s not really in a position to be shocked by it&#8211;from his perspective it&#8217;s old news. Which doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not disconcerting to run across it in big letters in a context like the LGM front page.</p>

		<p>Ok. Let&#8217;s assume I agree with this comment and was duly shocked by it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m shocked.</p>
<p>Now what? What is shock supposed to be doing here? Specifically, what is it supposed to be doing for me? There&#8217;s nothing it&#8217;s reminding me of that I don&#8217;t have daily, hourly reminders of.</p>

<p>Every time I think you&#8217;re arguing in good faith, you write something like this. You do realize that I&#8217;m not your personal writer, unless you happen to be fabulously wealthy and want to recompense me mightily for becoming such, which would be a different scenario entirely.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s&#8230;not at all the point of asking that question. </p>
<p>I mean, I would replace it with &#8220;black people&#8221;, but as you&#8217;ve indicated above, you dislike viewing us in what you call an abstract way. When presented with a non-abstract way, an assumption of dishonesty was my response.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s very important to furthering Drexciya&#8217;s cause to make the virulent racists appear to be more polite. God forbid they sound as offensive as they actually are, that might cause people to look at ostensibly kindly old white men differently, and we can&#8217;t be having that, now can we?</p>

		<p>Then say that.</p>
<p>You expect SEK, a known white person, to always ask himself &#8220;what is this <del>use of an ethnic slur</del> repetition of what a racist moron said supposed to do for black people?&#8221; when coming up with blog titles?</p>
<p>I guess he will from now on&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have been dealing with my 18 year old nephew who thought that race was something that was irrelevant today and he&#8217;s just kind of discovering that racism exists. Meanwhile, he&#8217;s grown up in an extreme right-wing environment. SEK telling truths about his experiences are precisely what people like that need.</p>

<p>It might. </p>
<p>But what does &#8220;breaking out of your comfy shell&#8221; mean, materially? A potentially and likely racist white person will likely still be white, racist and will still be a direct beneficiary of racism to an extent that will make its continuation likely. More passive, but very likely. Limiting it to this post, he will know that people still say &#8220;nigger&#8221; and that saying &#8220;nigger&#8221; is wrong. From where does a useful model of anti-racism derive? What does this person accept, in finding &#8220;nigger&#8221; shocking and wrong that actually challenges behavior he&#8217;s likely to engage in or benefit from? What&#8217;s the standard here? </p>
<p>And is white conversion more valuable than adopting social or rhetorical standards that make black exclusion less likely? Isn&#8217;t the best case scenario one that makes an effort to prioritize and execute <em>both</em> (I mean that for the sake of argument, I don&#8217;t actually agree with that)? There are ways to answer that which fall into a pseudo-benevolent calculus that nonetheless manages to reify various forms of racist value judgments. I think those should be avoided.</p>

		<p>Speaking as a former nearly transparent white child from the suburbs who was convinced that racism (and sexism, for that matter) used to be a thing but now we&#8217;ve fixed it, I have to say being inundated with stories about shockingly offensive racist behavior happening in this day and age had a significant impact on changing my views.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still obviously a nearly transparent white child from the suburbs, but I&#8217;m no longer convinced we&#8217;ve fixed racism and sexism. There&#8217;s also an important argument that the focus on truly egregious examples of unreconstructed racism can be part of a shell game in obscuring less egregious but possibly more significant because endemic forms of racism (or sexism), but for me the awareness that racists were REAL was essential to reaching this further conclusion, not an impediment to it.</p>
<p>Anyway. Anecdote only. Take with X quantity of salt.</p>

		<p><em>How do black people benefit from your awareness in a way that’s distinct from how they’re harmed by your unawareness?</em></p>
<p>OK, now I&#8217;m convinced you&#8217;re a 19-year-old white guy cluttering up this comment thread as an assignment for your Introduction to African-American Literature course. </p>
<p>That, or you really believe that there&#8217;s no social utility to people becoming aware of problems they didn&#8217;t previously know existed, thereby allowing them to act upon that awareness in the world at large. In which case you&#8217;re a dangerous idealist with a Manichaean streak who&#8217;s great at arguing but is utterly ineffectively politically &#8212; you know, like a libertarian.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Ok, so it made you “aware”. That’s well and good. How do black people benefit from your awareness in a way that’s distinct from how they’re harmed by your unawareness?</p></blockquote>
<p>If I wanted to bring in an entirely different disastrous debate that never ends I would say &#8220;it made me vote Democrat rather than third party.&#8221; Actually <em>two</em> disastrous debates. (It&#8217;s actually true, but let&#8217;s leave it to the side.)</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, I&#8217;m much less likely now to engage in at least some of the classic ignorant white person microaggressions, like telling jokes built on racial stereotypes, or telling you to just calm down when you get upset about my racial jokes. That&#8217;s something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m basically never going to vote for a politician who wants to eliminate affirmative action or enact right-leaning welfare reform, and I definitely was before, which has some extremely tiny impact on American policy.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t become an activist or run for office, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re asking, and I don&#8217;t demand to be considered an &#8220;ally&#8221; because I&#8217;m not a monster, but I&#8217;m substantially less likely to make things incrementally worse, which seems like a net positive.</p>

		<p>Hold on to your Confederate dollars, friend, the South will rise again!</p>
<p>Actually it probably is a lot better than it used to be, but there is still plenty of sub-rosa (and occasional recrudescences of full-blown, violent) racism to be found here.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think it is better than it was recently, say before President Obama started his successful run for the presidency. I saw a lot of it up close and personal in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The old white racist in the story didn&#8217;t learn anything from the experience. I wish SEK had been able to respond with &#8220;I think your use of a racist slur in front of children is far more evil than any music could ever be.&#8221; But I understand that being confronted with pure evil right there at the gas pump really doesn&#8217;t lend itself to instant rejoinders, no matter how powerful and gifted a language user a person may be.</p>
<p>I think it may get worse before it gets better, which is a shame.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure I like this &#8220;generations dying off&#8221; trope. It seems to imply that social progress just&#8230; happens, with cohort replacement, and all we have to do is sit tight and wait for it. Maybe we should say something like &#8220;it will require a long time and a lot of work.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t like it either. A guy I went to high school with is a very successful business man. He travels the south and west selling his wares. He is single handedly rebuilding the devastated downtown of our home town. He is also a virulent racist, homophobe, Bircher,  and he went out to Nevada to support Cliven Bundy. He has four kids. Any guesses to what the kids grow up to be?</p>

		<p>Like, an _actual_ Bircher? Or just has Bircher views? Are they even still around formally?</p>

		<blockquote><p>Who does this?</p></blockquote>
<p>My father, for one. Who is no more a southerner than anyone else who has spent 99% of their 75 years on Earth in the NYC metropolitan area.</p>
<p>My initially reaction to stories like this is to be surprised at the level of surprise evinced by my similarly-complected compatriots. But then I remember that we are all &#8211; in some form or fashion &#8211; prisoners of our own experience, and not everyone has spent the better part of their confinement in the same cell as an inveterate racist.</p>

		<p>The fact that the guy thought he could go up to SEK and make a comment, along with the weird &#8220;there are kids here&#8221; part, is the surprising part. Are southrons generally more publicly confrontational? </p>
<p>The sentiment is pretty banal and you get it certainly from some rural white people in Michigan.</p>

		<p>I guess I&#8217;m just wondering how much, if any, of this is true. This is always something I&#8217;ve wondered about SEK stories, but I wonder much more after the one about his cat reciting Yeats.</p>
<p>(And, yes, I understand that he wasn&#8217;t actually saying his cat was reciting Yeats, but from that post I had no idea what the cat was actually supposed to be doing, which leads to grave doubts about pretty much everything)</p>

		<p>A large part of my reputation as a &#8220;Vortex of Misfortune&#8221; is that the odd things that happen to me are verifiable, be it the office sex affair or my adventures with the library. In point of fact, when all this oddity started years ago, I <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unbelievable-up.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">posted verification</a>. (For context, that was when The Library <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stole all my money</a>, and that &#8220;verification&#8221; link goes to the letter it sent me &#8212; a poor graduate student at the time &#8212; for donating more than $1,200 to it. Because, you know, that&#8217;s something poor graduate students do.)</p>
<p>Also, I live in <em>Prairieville</em>. The stories I <em>don&#8217;t</em> tell are just as horrifying as the ones I do, I just can&#8217;t find a way to frame the depressing reality of them in a way that&#8217;s amusing.</p>

		<p>In Manny&#8217;s defense, my cat was not, in fact, reciting Yeats. I just thought it&#8217;d be really funny if that&#8217;s what his howling little Siamese mind was compelling him to do.</p>

		<p>THE CAT went here and there<br />
And the moon spun round like a top,<br />
And the nearest kin of the moon<br />
The creeping cat looked up.<br />
Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,<br />
For wander and wail as he would<br />
The pure cold light in the sky<br />
Troubled his animal blood.<br />
Minnaloushe runs in the grass,<br />
Lifting his delicate feet.<br />
Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?<br />
When two close kindred meet<br />
What better than call a dance?<br />
Maybe the moon may learn,<br />
Tired of that courtly fashion,<br />
A new dance turn.<br />
Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br />
From moonlit place to place,<br />
The sacred moon overhead<br />
Has taken a new phase.<br />
Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils<br />
Will pass from change to change,<br />
And that from round to crescent,<br />
From crescent to round they range?<br />
Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br />
Alone, important and wise,<br />
And lifts to the changing moon<br />
His changing eyes.</p>

		<p>No, No, the hat brim is useful to shading your eyes from the sunlight! </p>
<p>Plus the little size strap isn&#8217;t comfortable on my forehead, in the back there&#8217;s a tiny bit of hair to cushion that strap from my scalp.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wearing a one size fits all&#8230;</p>

		<p>FWIW over 30/35 years ago I was listening to an album by this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreigner_(band)" rel="nofollow">band</a> and my mother demanded that I turn that &#8220;jungle music&#8221; down&#8230;</p>
<p>She also once described Robert Plant&#8217;s caterwauling as sounding like the &#8220;Mau Maus on the warpath&#8221;</p>
<p>In case you were wondering oddly enough her political persuasion is best described as Liberal Democrat&#8230;</p>

		<p>That band should always be turned down preferably to zero but it&#8217;s more suburban sprawl rather than jungle music.</p>

		<p>Semi-OT, but I&#8217;m awfully curious about something. What is the n-bomb deprived standard for racist treatment of rap? &#8220;Rap is crap?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t like most hip hop except for Eminem?&#8221; &#8220;Rap isn&#8217;t real music?&#8221; &#8220;Rap was only good in the 80&#8217;s/90&#8217;s?&#8221; I mean, one of the natural consequences of segregation is occasionally expressed through segregation in tastes and cultural exposure. Is maintaining the results of that something worth addressing in spaces that note the ideal of diversity/inclusion and multiculturalism? Are there consequences to falling short of that?</p>
<p>Also, to what extent is minimal engagement with rap (or heck, even recent R&amp;B, (neo)soul, gospel or slightly older, sadly faded genres like New Jack Swing — much of it from <em>living</em>, still producing artists) <em>also</em> a minimal engagement with black culture generally? Is making such a culture effectively alien not a primary contribution to &#8220;othering&#8221; — which I&#8217;m sure we all agree has a negative impact?</p>

		<p><em>What is the n-bomb deprived standard for racist treatment of rap?</em></p>
<p>Like pornography, you know it when you see it, be it conservative white conniption over the imagery of Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s BET awards performance, or the growing acceptance of aging rappers so long as they transform themselves into respectable businessmen, hence the difference between Xzibit and Snoop. It&#8217;s not really that difficult. I do not, however, believe that &#8220;not writing about rap and hip-hop enough to satisfy Drexciya&#8221; qualifies as such a condition, as you seem to be implying.</p>

<p>While this is kind of true, my experience suggests that preferences for the golden age of hip hop can be code for &#8220;not that gangster thug stuff&#8221; which carries intensely negative and &#8211; for some of the rappers in question &#8211; welcomed racial connotations that even the government felt obliged to remark on negatively in the early 90&#8217;s. That code is definitively racist, though it must be said that there are non-racist forms of it. </p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGwI7nGehA" rel="nofollow">Zack de la Rocha is still alive</a>. That album was so good that he had the worst song/verse on it.</p>

<p>Huh. Admittedly I haven&#8217;t given it much thought (the very idea is pretty stupid) but N.W.A. is probably the first or second thing that pops into my head when I hear the phrase &#8220;golden age of hip-hop.&#8221;</p>

		<blockquote><p>“Rap was only good in the 80’s/90’s?”</p>
<p>is going to be said by people who grew up listening to rap in the 80s/90s and is not/would not be racist (ageist/generationist?)</p></blockquote>
<p>I think you can get to racism from that direction too. Those black people in your memory were fun! These new black people? Yikes! Scary!</p>
<p>After all there&#8217;s a big &#8220;when they knew their place&#8221; strain in American racism.</p>

		<p>I agree. The point is more that people are often inclined to soften what they remember (and KRS-One had zero hits, rendering softening unnecessary for most people).</p>

		<p>I have to admit that I don&#8217;t much like rap/hip-hop. I dislike it less than when it was new and different. I really hate the DJ style, too, destroying a vinyl record to make odd sounds. At least they&#8217;re still making them, back in the day it could feel like tearing one up was a permanent loss.</p>
<p>I like Miles Davis, Nina Simone, Louis A, jazz and swing, even really old styles like Dixieland, Professor Longhair (RIP)&#8230; well, there are hundreds of them. </p>
<p>But I&#8217;m an old, after all. Sorta like my Dad liking Lena Horne, and Sammy Davis &#8211; who was truly gifted &#8211; look on youtube for him doing a long set in the voices of every other singer of his time. Perfectly. All of them. </p>
<p>I am old. I&#8217;m trying to get used to it, but it&#8217;s hard.</p>

		<blockquote><p>What is the n-bomb deprived standard for racist treatment of rap?</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand what your asking.  Offhand I&#8217;d say it would be presenting socially &#8220;negative&#8221; subgenres like gangsta as the definitional exemplar of rap (and I&#8217;ll go ahead and show my age and un-hip-ness again by going back to how Ice-T&#8217;s &#8220;Cop Killer&#8221; was portrayed as emblematic of the entire genre, and further back to the PMRC labeling crapfest that resulted from 2 Live Crew) to the exclusion of all of the varied gradations of political content (from none to the most virulent you can think of) that can be categorized as &#8220;rap&#8221; in a musical sense.  And of course ignoring the existence of white rap artists like Eminem and (much as we&#8217;d like to) Vanilla Ice.</p>
<blockquote><p>to what extent is minimal engagement with rap&#8230;also a minimal engagement with black culture generally? Is making such a culture effectively alien not a primary contribution to “othering”&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Making&#8221; it effectively alien?  I think the problem is more that it IS seen as alien.  I don&#8217;t know what the solution is.  I think rap has done a lot in terms of raising awareness of &#8220;black culture&#8221; in the white culture.  But just by having the concept of a &#8220;black culture&#8221; as opposed to a &#8220;white culture&#8221; or whatever culture, and positing a unique cultural experience on racial/ethnic lines, isn&#8217;t that by definition &#8220;othering&#8221;?  It at least opens the door for it.</p>
<p>I think as long as it&#8217;s not used as an excuse for oppression and repression, considering a subculture &#8220;alien&#8221; is not necessarily a bad thing.  It may even be a good thing, preserving a kind of cultural living history for future generations.  But it seems that all too often it is indeed used for just such negative and hurtful purposes.</p>

		<p>I think this is interesting.  My partner who is a white man in his late 50s does not like rap &#8211; except for the Beastie Boys. I think of this as a racial prejudice because why would the only rap music you enjoy just happen to be rap performed by white people? I also think he&#8217;s overly critical about the lyrical content of rap as opposed to other rock music, e.g., that it is violent, or espouses a gangster lifestyle, etc. and think of this as a racial prejudice. It really is a form of othering, or at least, setting standards differently for different groups.</p>

		<p>Part of it is that the Beasties are great and part of it would be that he probably has heard less rap in general, or so I&#8217;d guess. </p>
<p>Radio programmers were super parochial, so if he got most of his new music from rock formatted stations or watched MTV in the 80s or 90s you&#8217;d hear the Beasties alongside rock acts, but never A Tribe Called Quest or De La Soul, which a lot of people I knew who liked the Beasties in the mid-90s also liked for similar reasons. I don&#8217;t recall anything in those groups&#8217; lyrics to object to even on the level of License to Ill, to say nothing of All Eyez on Me.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Also, to what extent is minimal engagement with rap (or heck, even recent R&amp;B, (neo)soul, gospel or slightly older, sadly faded genres like New Jack Swing — much of it from living, still producing artists) also a minimal engagement with black culture generally? Is making such a culture effectively alien not a primary contribution to “othering” — which I’m sure we all agree has a negative impact?</p></blockquote>
<p>A <em>lack</em> of interest in certain genres of music is exactly as indicative of a racist viewpoint as the <em>presence </em>of interest in those genres.</p>
<p>It is precisely as reasonable to conclude that someone is anti-black because they don&#8217;t like rap, or don&#8217;t like some rap, as it would be to conclude that someone <i>isn&#8217;t</i> racist because they do like rap, or some rap.</p>

		<p>I largely agree with your comment jfL, but I don&#8217;t think that answers or responds to my question, which was a good deal different from that. </p>
<p>Hip hop perpetuates styles, dance forms, social habits, sounds, messages etc that are coded as threatening and alien to a WHOLE lot of white people. The person in SEK&#8217;s anecdote heard rap and thought &#8220;nigger music&#8221;. Michael Dunn &#8211; who killed Jordan Davis for playing rap music too loudly heard &#8211; it and shot him for listening to it. His girlfriend testified that he called it &#8220;rap crap&#8221; and said he hated that &#8220;thug music&#8221;. Speaking more broadly, sagging, bandanna/durag wearing, long shirts, playing loud rap music, etc is way, way more likely to get you attention in public (and attempts at banning in some places) than dressing in a way that doesn&#8217;t have hip hop coding. That&#8217;s actually magnified if you dress that way, at least in my experience, if you dress that way or associate with young dudes who dress that way.</p>
<p>Given how white media initially coded hip hop and how white people still use potentially hip hop-associated stylings to determine &#8220;suspicious/thug&#8221; vs &#8220;not-suspicious/thug&#8221;, I just wonder if it&#8217;s useful to consider how detachment from a pretty pivotal aspect of black culture makes the othering process considerably easier. If it&#8217;s not this, it would be something else, of course, but I don&#8217;t really see useful models of black social/political inclusion that doesn&#8217;t more openly normalize the things black people like, partially as an effort to combat and correct existing political markers. You don&#8217;t have to favor it, but in segregated social and artistic contexts, its combative and selective embrace has unnecessarily negative consequences and that&#8217;s not even getting into how white consumption without much black participation/contact can use hip hop as a model for rather incredible/insulting caricatures and power fantasies.</p>
<p>Like I said, I mostly agree, but the question you quoted is a little different from that, or so I thought.</p>

<p>Given the example of the rap-fan frat guys at Erik&#8217;s college, I don&#8217;t think it matters much one way or the other. It is no more difficult to &#8220;other&#8221; black people by Flav&#8217;ing it up than by ignoring rap altogether.</p>
<p>I think I answered exactly the question you asked.</p>

		<p>Do they live in a suburb? Or in a city? If they live in a city, are they gentrifiers? Also, please  list their entire record collection.</p>

		<p>Actually, in this case, we&#8217;re actually talking about people&#8217;s subjective ideology and viewpoint &#8211; whether they themselves are racist people with racist sentiments &#8211; while the previous thread was about the significance of their actions in a larger context, actions which can contribute to institutional racism even in the absence of any racist ideology or viewpoint.</p>

		<blockquote><p>What is the n-bomb deprived standard for racist treatment of rap?</p></blockquote>
<p>At a bare minimum, I would say that the assumption that rap is only for black people, and, as a corollary, that non-black people should assume that black people are solely interested in rap as a musical genre, would make for a decent baseline, especially since we&#8217;re talking about the circumstances and effects of cultural segregation.</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean, one of the natural consequences of segregation is occasionally expressed through segregation in tastes and cultural exposure.  Is maintaining the results of that something worth addressing in spaces that note the ideal of diversity/inclusion and multiculturalism? Are there consequences to falling short of that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Maintaining the results of that is certainly worth addressing. I&#8217;d go further and say the existence of those results and the circumstances of their creation are even more worthy, because the maintenance question depends on this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, to what extent is minimal engagement with rap (or heck, even recent R&amp;B, (neo)soul, gospel or slightly older, sadly faded genres like New Jack Swing — much of it from living, still producing artists) also a minimal engagement with black culture generally? Is making such a culture effectively alien not a primary contribution to “othering” — which I’m sure we all agree has a negative impact?</p></blockquote>
<p>On the question of alienating and othering; yes, definitely. We see this quite clearly in all the instances where black people are effectively erased from the culture they produce when that culture becomes an item of mass consumption. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d further argue that because the erasure from black people from rap has not been accomplished to any extent comparable to prior examples of erasure is why rap continues to be singled out as uniquely worthy of criticism, up to an including questioning its very authenticity as a musical genre. (White) people said the same thing about jazz and rock, we don&#8217;t anymore, and the reason for that is because those genres have been decoupled from their black cultural origins in the minds of the casual white consumer.</p>
<p>On the question of &#8220;minimal engagement,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. What constitutes &#8220;minimal?&#8221; Further, must the engagement be conscious in order to count as a meaningful one? I&#8217;m assuming the answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to ask.</p>

		<p>What I love about crotchety old fucks is their complete lack of insight. When their fathers were crotchety old fucks, they were mad about the rock &#8216;n roll music. (Too black!)</p>
<p>And before that, their croctchety old fuck grandfather was mad about the negro jazz music!</p>
<p>(And I&#8217;m sure at some point along the line for jazz, rock, and rap, each of these generations of white men had acts that they did like, unless they were real backwood crackers who only like fiddle music or something.)</p>
<p>You know <em>who else </em>was upset about the jazz music?</p>

		<p>I think SEK is in Bobby Jindal&#8217;s Louisiana. And not the New Orleans part (although OldAssWhiteGuys comment wouldn&#8217;t be that unusual there either.).</p>

		<p>Oh, I just don&#8217;t have the energy for this comment, but after that passive aggressive intro, I&#8217;ll write 5000 words on the subject&#8230;.</p>
<p>That Drexciya thinks the real problem with this post is SEK and not actual racists shows how totally useless he is in our comment threads. That so many commenters follow his words as a prophet speaks poorly for their critical judgement. Drexciya offers absolutely no useful way forward, instead desiring a constant conversation over language that leads absolutely nowhere in a moment where the racists like SEK dealt with today feel empowered to say anything they want and where the entire Republican Party is teetering into open fascism. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also notable that for someone who claims to be radical, he has never shown any ability to interest to speak about alliances with other racial groups, has shown no class analysis at all, has never even attempted to comes to terms with the BLM movement interrupting an event on the oppression of Latino immigrants in Arizona during the Netroots Nation event, and basically has nothing to say at all about anything ever except policing language in terms that only makes sense to those who have taken a bunch of graduate seminars in theory-heavy humanities disciplines. </p>
<p>Drexicya basically has nothing useful to say and the sooner the rest of you realize that, the better off we will all be, including him. </p>
<p>God knows SEK can argue himself out of any situation (or into one as he so desires) but I just don&#8217;t really care what anyone thinks about this, I&#8217;ve had enough of commenters sucking up to Drexciya&#8217;s worthless posturing. </p>
<p>Hate me if you want.</p>

		<p>There have been times on-line, including on this site, where something has been posted that draws such contempt from me that marshaling a long and detailed counter seems, for the moment, too demanding of my patience. If I still desire to respond to it in such a manner after some time has passed, and the initial reaction of &#8220;Fucking <em>really</em>?&#8221; has passed with it, then I&#8217;ll do so, but I probably won&#8217;t offer any kind of snapshot of that contempt in the exact moment that I feel it. I do this because it works for me; it&#8217;s in my comfort zone, and the nature of the medium allows for it. It doesn&#8217;t work for Drexciya, for reasons that are not my concern and, more importantly, really not any of my business. That doesn&#8217;t mean either of us is right or wrong, it only means that we do what works for us.</p>

		<p>I have butted heads with Drex in the past, and doubtless will again, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Is it that unreasonable a request? Drex&#8217;s initial comment boiled down to &#8220;Hey, &#8216;n&#8212;-r&#8217; is not a word I hope to see in the headlines here.&#8221; And instead of a &#8220;my bad, didn&#8217;t mean to offend, let me go ahead and dash it out&#8221; we get dozens of comments whitesplaining (and SEK, let me goysplain to you that however bad Jews may have it in the South growing up, it&#8217;s not the same as being black) that it&#8217;s important that we see the word printed out to shock us out of our delusions that Louisiana is some paradise of post-racial equality. Or something.</p>
<p>Really, is the freedom to spell out that word, to get your &#8220;igge&#8221; in print instead of seeing those courageous letters replaced by cowardly dashes &#8212; is that the hill you want to die on, here?</p>
<p>Drex may or may not be an asshole. But he ain&#8217;t the person who began the assholery on this post, and he isn&#8217;t the one who comes out of this post looking bad, in my extremely white opinion.</p>

		<p>If a direct quote is a terrible thing, then we as liberals are totally fucked. That&#8217;s not beginning the assholery. That&#8217;s directly quoting what racists are saying. Meanwhile, while we spend 500 comments on this point, the right is moving back toward lynching black people and throwing Muslims in concentration camps. But let&#8217;s focus on what&#8217;s actually important.</p>

		<p>You know why you constantly beat up on purity liberals who voted for Nader instead of conservatives who voted for Bush? Because the liberals are <em>supposed</em> to be on <em>our</em> side.</p>
<p>No black person is unaware that there are racist fuckers out there in Trumpsylvania. But I imagine many would prefer not to have their noses rubbed in racist commentary here.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, if the headline said &#8220;Turn your n&#8212;-r music down&#8221; not one more lynching would occur and not one more Muslim refugee would be banned from the US than in the current state of affairs. But fewer commenters would feel that this is another place where they have to operate with their defenses up.</p>
<p>I have trouble seeing that as a net loss.</p>

		<p>This really focuses on the important issue here. </p>
<p>I mean, do you really believe Drexciya would have acted difference with the asteriks? Is there any evidence of that? Every single comment he ever writes is shaming white liberals about race. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not racist commentary to directly quote what racists are saying. To say that it is racist is fucking stupid.</p>

		<p>So I&#8217;m hardly a regular commenter here, but I have accidentally stumbled across a few of these cesspools of comment threads before. Why the fuck does anyone bother to engage with this guy? Literally everything he says is clearly designed to derail the discussion into some bullshit pseudo-academic exercise in navel-gazing that leaves everyone involved reeking of how their jackass redneck uncle might imagine liberals at their worst.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s trolling even when it&#8217;s being done by someone nominally on your side of the ideological spectrum.</p>

<p>A very very figurative use of &#8220;literally&#8221;. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve disagreed with Drex. I&#8217;ve agreed with Drex. I&#8217;ve passed over some of their comments unread. I&#8217;ve skimmed others. I&#8217;ve read yet others.</p>
<p>Your characterisation seems rather incorrect to me. Even on this post, you can see give and take and perfectly reasonable points and subdiscussions. You can even see attempts to steer the conversation back toward helpful by Drex.</p>

		<p>No, when I said literally, I meant I wasted many minutes of my life reading every single reply in this waste of a comment thread, and I found not a single comment of his that productively contributed to anything not based on his own semantic arguments.</p>

		<p>So a figurative use of &#8220;literally&#8221; coupled with a poor coding of the comments?</p>
<p>Ok. </p>
<p>So, semantic arguments are just always wrong and wrongheaded? That seems an odd claim. Drex is hardly alone here. </p>
<p>So you don&#8217;t like Drex&#8217;s comments and effect on comment threads. The former is, of course, perfectly fair (though I think you let your dislike slide into uncharity, cf Erik in this thread esp on commenters who find that some of Drex&#8217;s comments (at least) have merit). The latter really needs more scrutiny. At the very least, we should recognize that it&#8217;s a real possibility that people are reacting (or over reacting) to content as well as other features of Drex&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>I have witnessed discussions of eg feminism (in a philosophy context) that had much the same pattern. The feminist got piled onto. Complaints about the theoretical language used abounded. Claims that they were making it &#8220;all about her&#8221; were commonplace. Etc.</p>
<p>Of course, a troll or bad actor can trigger or pretend to have triggered such reactions. Dilan, for example, treats veypry content specific piling on as personal. So there is an epistemic problem here. </p>
<p>I look at the exchanges in this thread and my reaction is that Scott and Erik came off particularly poorly, in a sort of classic way *If* Drex were a troll, they would have a moment of triumph. That suggests that our collective reactions aren&#8217;t good. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Drex is a troll, so I imagine that this thread was harder on them then on anyone else.</p>

		<p>You use one of the most offensive words in the English lexicon and you&#8217;re shocked, shocked that someone would be offended? Really?</p>
<p>And if Drex had acted in exactly the same manner in response to a headline that said &#8216;n*****r&#8217;, then I would agree that it was an overreaction and not be weighing in to support him. But in this case, in this post, his reaction seems eminently reasonable and yours (and Scott&#8217;s)&#8230; not so much.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not saying Drex is always reasonable. As I mentioned, I&#8217;ve gotten crosswise with him in the past, and doubtless will again. But right now, in this post, he has the moral high ground.</p>

		<p>Okay I&#8217;ve avoided this thread because it was obvious where it was going, but seriously? </p>
<blockquote><p>You use one of the most offensive words in the English lexicon and you’re shocked, shocked that someone would be offended? Really?</p></blockquote>
<p>On what planet is quoting something the same as using it yourself?</p>

		<p>And as far as I can tell, Drexciya doesn&#8217;t have one comment in that thread. Too busy arguing about how liberalism and free speech are support beams for white supremacism no doubt.</p>

		<p>Generally speaking, as a privileged well-to-do male WASP:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t argue with black people (or Latinos, or Asians, or&#8230;) who tell me something I said is racist<br />
I don&#8217;t argue with women who tell me something I said is sexist<br />
I don&#8217;t argue with Jews who tell me something I said is anti-Semitic</p>
<p>Lived experience matters. Intent isn&#8217;t magic. And that&#8217;s true even if the person calling me out is an asshole.</p>
<p>Drex may be a horrible person who eats raw puppies every day, with ketchup on them. I don&#8217;t know. But at this time, on this blog post, his request for consideration seems eminently reasonable, and our esteemed hosts&#8217; replies less so.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Generally speaking, as a privileged well-to-do male WASP:</p>
<p>I don’t argue with black people (or Latinos, or Asians, or…) who tell me something I said is racist</p></blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, I listen to what they have to say, and use the brain God gave me to draw a conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lived experience matters.</p></blockquote>
<p> It is one thing that matters. It is not everything that matters.</p>
<p>You know, I have a great deal of lived experience in certain areas. When a conversation about one of those topics comes up, however, I don&#8217;t feel the need to play the DO YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM? card to dominate and end the conversation. Rather, and I draw on that lived experience to improve and enlighten the things I have to say while having the conversation. Then again, I&#8217;m not devoted to the position that only urban planners have a right to talk about planning.</p>

		<p>Guess what? Not all people in those communities agree on those definitions. Is TJ coming here and complaining about this too? Other African-American commenters? Just because one person says something does not mean that it is true. This is just a basic point of evidence. But this explains a lot about how the commenters respond to Drexciya&#8211;he says something, it becomes the voice of black authenticity to white liberals because he claims radicalism, and that&#8217;s that.</p>

		<p>Nope. And if TJ and other African-American commenters were showing up and saying &#8220;cool your jets, Drex, it ain&#8217;t that big a deal&#8221; then your position would be more defensible. But right now, 100% of self-identified black posters on this blog have encouraged you to remove the word, and instead they&#8217;re getting whitesplained at.</p>

		<p>Well, in all seriousness, how many self-identified black posters can you name on this site? I can name 3. I certainly hope that I just haven&#8217;t been paying attention and there are a lot more, because I already spend enough time in homogenous white upper-middle-class discussions at the office.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there aren&#8217;t more than three, it might have something to do with a general attitude that it&#8217;s okay to offend black readers if it&#8217;s in the interest of educating/motivating white readers.</p>

		<p>Totally&#8211;our goal is that it&#8217;s totally OK to offend black readers. </p>

		<p>I have never claimed radicalism, to my recollection. </p>
<p>I make no effort to cultivate that cache for white people since, by your own statement, I spend most of my time calling them racist and antagonizing them. </p>
<p>Every other black person on this site can and does speak for themselves. I have made no effort to try and speak for them and would never.</p>

		<p>Oh of course you aren&#8217;t cultivating that. You know enough about the 1960s civil rights movement and relationship with white allies to know how this works. Would be counterproductive if that was what you were trying to do, which I&#8217;m not actually saying it is what you are trying to do.</p>

		<p>Drex reminds me of that &#8216;Meat is murder&#8217; guy we used to get every once in a while. I tried to drive him away with succulent pork recipes. Perhaps Beastie Boys and Ice-T lyrics could be similarly employed.</p>

		<p><em>Every other black person on this site can and does speak for themselves. I have made no effort to try and speak for them and would never.</em></p>
<p>Um&#8230;</p>
<p><em>First off, some white dude using “nigger music” with you is not a black experience, because you aren’t black, and didn’t react like a black person, but reacted like a non-black person who encountered an anti-black ethnic slur.</em></p>
<p>This is my problem with you &#8212; I&#8217;m not &#8220;whitesplaining,&#8221; I&#8217;m &#8220;argumentsplaining,&#8221; because you can&#8217;t keep yours straight, so you&#8217;re firing wildly at different targets in order to prove&#8230;something, it&#8217;s hard to tell. But you&#8217;re winning converts, so go Donald &#8212; I mean &#8220;Drexciya&#8221; &#8212; go!</p>

<p>Eh. I don&#8217;t see that among the commenters at all. It certainly doesn&#8217;t seem true of me. It seems that there&#8217;s a range of reaction from fairly hostile to fairly receptive. You might still find Drex&#8217;s impact on the conversation deterimental, but I don&#8217;t see why it needs to be distorted.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it does, and if you want me to agree, you&#8217;re going to have to a whole lot better than telling me what race the complainer is.</p>

		<p>You know, in general, I give a heightened degree of deference (not &#8220;automatically accept what they say as gospel&#8221; but a heightened deference) to black people on topics of race, too.</p>
<p>It takes months of bad behavior to overcome that. There are a single-digit number of people who have accomplished the task. I don&#8217;t give a flying F about what Throttle Jockey has to say about Bill Cosby being framed because he&#8217;s black, and I don&#8217;t have a whole lot of time for Drexciya&#8217;s  shtick, either.</p>

		<p>Why don&#8217;t you argue with people just because they have &#8220;lived experience?&#8221; Even if you grant that it &#8220;matters,&#8221; does that suddenly deprive you of the right to have an opinion? That seems like moral cowardice to me, if you disagree with them even after considering that they might have perspective you lack.</p>

		<p><em>instead of a “my bad, didn’t mean to offend, let me go ahead and dash it out”</em></p>
<p>Because I don&#8217;t let other people dictate what I write on my blog? Because I don&#8217;t believe Drexciya has made a single coherent argument, and has been arguing in bad faith this entire thread, and therefore shouldn&#8217;t be rewarded by forcing me to self-censor? Because I still believe that the tactical deployment of racial epithets delivered in the context of, for example, an everyday experience isn&#8217;t something worth burying, because sunlight&#8217;s the best remedy for racism? </p>
<p><em>the freedom to spell out that word, to get your “igge” in print instead of seeing those courageous letters replaced by cowardly dashes</em></p>
<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve entirely missed the point, meaning you either read and didn&#8217;t understand my comments, or jumped into the debate without having read them and passed judgment on me anyway.</p>
<p><em>But he ain’t the person who began the assholery on this post</em></p>
<p>That would be the OLD WHITE MAN whose words I transcribed for posterity &#8212; oh, wait, you mean that&#8217;d be me for transcribing them? I&#8217;m sorry, when I call out racists for being racist, I&#8217;m not going to do it with kid gloves on. I&#8217;m not going to sugarcoat their awfulness and risk making them appear like better people than they are. That&#8217;s just not going to happen.</p>
<p>If Drexciya disagrees with the rhetorical strategies I employ to shame racists, he&#8217;s more than welcome to start reading some other site with whose methodology he agrees.</p>

		<p>I read your defense, and it seemed to come down to &#8220;people won&#8217;t realize how racist the racist fucker was if I bowdlerize the word&#8221; and &#8220;not gonna change it, can&#8217;t make me!&#8221; Oh, and &#8220;I&#8217;m not racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe you are a racist. I believe that like most of us, you occasionally do racist things. I think insisting on your freedom to quote racist slurs, and specifically telling a member of the slurred minority group that he doesn&#8217;t get to be offended because you know your intent in using the word&#8230; well, it ain&#8217;t your finest hour.</p>
<p>But yeah, you don&#8217;t have to let others dictate what you can write on your blog. You can stand up proudly against the PC police who try to get all considerate of minority fee-fees. You&#8217;re a free-by-God American, and you&#8217;re protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>But the rest of us can still point out that you&#8217;re being an asshole.</p>

		<p>I love the idea that by using some asterisks while quoting an actual racist fuck, that would have made him not an asshole. </p>
<p>To say that is a less than compelling argument is underselling the point.</p>

		<p>Jesus-tap-dancing-Christ, I write for Salon, I <em>am</em> the fucking PC police. But you know what, fuck it, actions speak louder than words, even if those actions are hundreds of thousands of words. I don&#8217;t care whether or not you think I&#8217;m a racist, I&#8217;ve got a longer track record that&#8217;s only getting longer. I&#8217;m a vocal proponent of a number of causes who has admitted, on multiple occasions, when I&#8217;ve made missteps, and apologized accordingly.</p>
<p>The problem with Drexciya is he&#8217;s an absolutist who&#8217;s incapable of recognizing that a difference in strategy isn&#8217;t a good reason to <em>burn everybody&#8217;s shit down</em>. He writes like an undergraduate who&#8217;s taken a few African-American studies courses and believes his singular opinions are now worthy of being written in stone &#8212; which, of course, is an unfair assessment of Drexciya, about whom I know nothing, and a complete and utter mischaracterization of what goes on in African-American studies courses, but I&#8217;m just using his standards of evidence. </p>
<p>Funny how offensive it sounds, even though I&#8217;m acknowledging to just borrowing Drexciya&#8217;s argumentative mode. You know why? Because it&#8217;s an offense argumentative mode, to make unfounded assumptions about interlocutors and to discount by fiat what are, in fact, ongoing arguments within a discipline. </p>
<p>To claim that you can&#8217;t disagree with Drexciya because you haven&#8217;t lived the black experience is to 1) turn &#8220;the black experience&#8221; into something monolithic, which it&#8217;s not, and 2) create the false impression that there are settled opinions about fraught issues, as if Ishmael Reed and James Baldwin and Toni Morrison always agree with each other about employing the word &#8220;nigger.&#8221; Sorry, that&#8217;s simply not the case, and I&#8217;m not going to pretend that it is just to spare Drexciya&#8217;s feelings. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given him ample space to air his objections, so at this point, he can either cut another tone, try to engage in a conversation instead of being a demagogue, or he find a space in which people adhere to the standards he desires. It&#8217;s a big Internet, he can even start his own blog if he desires.</p>

		<p>Uh, seriously? I read this thread and nowhere did I see Drexciya saying that SEK was The Problem. From my reading, Drexciya expressed entirely understandable sentiments regarding the use of a racial slur in a blog post title. If my agreement with him/her on this makes me one of his/her followers and him/her my prophet, well, that&#8217;s a pretty low bar, but fine. </p>
<p>Also, to my very pale, Jewish mind, describing Drexciya as only &#8220;policing language,&#8221; particularly with respect to this incident, is grossly unfair. (And yes, while I have personally been to the South and know they do not see us as white, they certainly don&#8217;t see us Black either and I would not agree with SEK&#8217;s characterisation there).</p>
<p>Relatedly, the idea that Drexciya&#8217;s behaviour with respect to this post is &#8220;worthless posturing&#8221; is offensive in my opinion. Perhaps language on this blog does need, if not policing, at least consideration given the title of this post?</p>

		<p>Again, saying that someone directly quoting a racist is somehow racist to expose and attack that racism is, to say the least, ridiculous.</p>

		<p>Drexciya&#8217;s 2nd comment was:</p>
<p><i>And I’m not casting aspersions, but there are about two million other ways to frame that exchange — even leaving the excerpt completely, faithfully intact (“nigger” and all) — that isn’t just bam wow in your face n-bomb every time I look at the post and see a response to it. </i></p>
<p>Yes, I get that SEK wanted to attack the espoused racism he encountered. What Drexciya, and several others in the post, have said is that there are other ways to frame the encounter. How does it do liberals or leftists any favours to attack racism in a way that people who are actual targets of said racism find problematic? </p>
<p>As for your comment that I was responding to:<br />
<i>That Drexciya thinks the real problem with this post is SEK and not actual racists shows how totally useless he is in our comment threads.</i> </p>
<p>Nowhere has Drexciya, as far as I can tell, stated that SEK was more of a problem than &#8220;actual racists.&#8221; Maybe I am restating things, but why is it such a big deal for a black person to point out that using a racial slur in a blogpost title is not the best idea? I mean, here you and SEK are saying that our #1 priority needs to be the upcoming GOPFascistMerica so everybody&#8217;s concerns about language should take a backseat&#8230;except then there&#8217;s this hearty defense for using language as you&#8217;d like. Surely it would help the non-fascist alliance if we listened to the concerns of other non-fascists?</p>

		<p>I have no idea what you do all day, I am referring solely to this blog post and the conversations within it. Clearly I am just not as smart as other blog posters, but my takeaway from most of this post has been massive pushback to a self-identified Black poster whose <i>initial comments</i> were about not using racial slurs in post titles. I do not think this is a good thing, nor do I think it is helping further the cause of addressing racism. As Lord Jesus Perm says below, the discussion on this is very much over the top.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m just going to say that I think a lot of the divide at LGM relates to the growth of activist spaces. They&#8217;re critical to spotlighting issues, inspiring people to speak out against racism and to also see racism as structural in addition to individual. They&#8217;re relatively very good at establishing and enforcing group cohesion, though that of course alienates a lot of people. It&#8217;s great that there are activist spaces, and in such a space, I would be shocked to see this post title presented in this way.</p>
<p>But not everything is an activist space, and activist spaces aren&#8217;t healthy for every discussion under the sun. They&#8217;re not really great at engendering empathy of anybody else not at the center of the space &#8212; they&#8217;re great at teaching people how to demand empathy or at least respect for themselves. They don&#8217;t value bracing language qua bracing language, because it might intimidate or offend people in the audience. They talk a lot about intersectionality, but the results are &#8230; Mixed. In a way, it&#8217;s a little bit like Title VII norms and expectations on steroids: no unwelcome or hostile remarks or you&#8217;re discriminating, mention/use distinction is virtually meaningless, emphasize the avoidance of controversial ideas for the in-group in favor of putting out messages and strategies that can further the mission.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to have other types of places and authors with other priorities, because that serves a purpose too. Thing is, my assumption about Drexciya and a lot of other people, is that they really just want this place to be adopt the norms of activist spaces. Did you mention an offensive term? Accept that &#8220;use/mention&#8221; has no currency and strike it out. Are you making a successful effort to show sensitivity and relate your personal experience toward multiple facets of the topic you&#8217;re addressing, even in passing, such as hip hop? No?. Then probably don&#8217;t really say anything at all unless you&#8217;re willing to change the habits of what you post, what you link to, what you &#8220;promote,&#8221; etc. Unfortunately this set of norms gets boiled down to &#8220;show respect&#8221; when I think it&#8217;s quite a bit more than that because of the function it serves.    </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want LGM to be that place. I think a lot of people don&#8217;t want LGM to be that place. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the intention here. Drexciya isn&#8217;t necessarily more vocal about this topic than lots of other commenters, he&#8217;s just more willing to walk right up the line of calling you a racist and then asking you for an award because he didn&#8217;t cross a line he had no reason to dance up to in the very first place.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know why a space where non-black people are considerably more circumspect &#8211; and preferably, completely avoidant &#8211; about when and where to use &#8220;nigger&#8221; is an activist space and why, if that&#8217;s the definition of an activist space, it&#8217;d be bad to become one. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually a really, really, really, really low bar. I mean, really low. It&#8217;s considerably lower than what my actual bar is.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t even come close to saying what you just wrote. You&#8217;re being ridiculous and you know it. The point is not that only in activist spaces are non-black people &#8220;completely avoidant about when and where to [mention slurs].&#8221; The point is that they are a particular type of <em>political</em> space where the choice to mention a slur in a headline rather than signify it some other way  &#8212; the choice to <em>not</em> censor one&#8217;s mentions regardless of intent or effect &#8212; is seen as presumptively  illegitimate if it offends someone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great way to run, for example, a workplace, where people shouldn&#8217;t get overly invested in whether they mentioned a slur or used it, in almost every case.. It&#8217;s not a great way to hold each and every political discussion.</p>
<p>Edit: Honestly I get why SEK was tempted to talk about removing your posts. You&#8217;re being particularly ridiculous tonight.</p>

		<p><i>The point is that they are a particular type of political space where the choice to mention a slur in a headline rather than signify it some other way — the choice to not censor one’s mentions regardless of intent or effect — is seen as presumptively illegitimate if it offends someone.</i></p>
<p>Presumptively illegitimate?? Again, I do not think this has been said. Rather it has been suggested that &#8220;maybe the racial slur in the headline is not the way to go.&#8221; If that&#8217;s presumptively illegitimate, well, it&#8217;s certainly a new use of the word.</p>
<p>Also, as far as I can tell no one is asking for censorship. I don&#8217;t think any comments have actually said something along the lines of &#8220;change this post title now!&#8221; So I don&#8217;t see the &#8216;self censorship&#8217; angle either.</p>
<p>Additionally, if it s a choice (e.g. conscious decision) to mention the slur in the headline, then perhaps some pushback can be expected? It is a slur after all, they are offensive, etc.</p>

		<p>Wait, what?  Here&#8217;s one:</p>
<blockquote><p>And instead of a “my bad, didn’t mean to offend, let me go ahead and dash it out” we get dozens of comments whitesplaining</p></blockquote>
<p>That is asking for self-censorship. It&#8217;s ALSO using the term &#8220;whitesplaning&#8221; even though SEK has said, like, five times, that he is Jewish and does not identify as white, so he probably doesn&#8217;t love being told he is &#8220;whitesplaining.&#8221; That is exactly what I meant by the activist space&#8217;s failure to engage in basic intersectionality or, you know, common courtesy.</p>
<p>Take a look at this again:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I’m not casting aspersions, but there are about two million other ways to frame that exchange — even leaving the excerpt completely, faithfully intact (“[slur]” and all) — that isn’t just bam wow in your face n-bomb every time I look at the post and see a response to it. Who’s that supposed to shock exactly and how? Why is the presence of shock, effect or worse a value worth cultivating in this context?</p></blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t think this is a request to reframe this particular exchange via self-censorship? Okay then.</p>

		<p>I did look at it again. I would draw your attention to</p>
<p><i>even leaving the excerpt completely, faithfully intact (“[slur]” and all)</i></p>
<p>which I fail to read as asking someone to self-censor.</p>
<p>Also, you&#8217;re talking about common courtesy, and surely this can be extended the other way as well? Perhaps I am one of those self censorship proponents, but I personally think that not putting an offensive racial slur in a post title would be courteous.</p>

		<p>Of course it can be extended the other way. My dirty secret here is that I think Drexciya is <em>probably correct </em> that the mention in the post title is a bad idea. But he baited SEK into an argument over it. He is, in fact, a wildly offensive guy who enjoys baiting people and pretending he is not doing so. He said, with no support, the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>But your conception of useful, anti-racist white liberal/white leftism is <em>deliberately and intentionally</em> about centering the concerns, politics and emotional/political movement of white people only.</p></blockquote>
<p>And people wonder why SEK got irritated. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Also, although I&#8217;m sure Lord Jesus Perm doesn&#8217;t see eye-to-eye with me here, he noted down thread that Drexciya made a non-too-subtle suggestion that SEK edit the post title. So it&#8217;s not just me. In fact, not seeing it is pretty nuts.</p>

		<p>Right. As you noted, Drexciya&#8217;s whole MO here is to make strong implicit arguments that the people who don&#8217;t agree with him are racist, based on an appeal to authority from his own blackness, and derail every thread he participates in by forcing it into some arcane argument on whatever thin reed he chose for that day (as Erik says above, I don&#8217;t think he would have been any less obtuse if SEK had asterisked the final five letters of the word in the title). The biggest irony of all is how downright dismissive and insulting Drexciya is of other black people who articulate views counter to his own. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, as of now I see he&#8217;s been totally silent on the matter of conservatives trying to make it much harder for non-white students to get in to first rate universities on the explicit argument that even mediocre white kids must be superior to non-whites.</p>

		<p>Which was said in response to: </p>
<blockquote><p>Because we’re living in a historical moment in which liberals and leftists, a.k.a. most of the readers of this site, can’t believe it’s possibly getting as bad as it is, no matter how many articles I write about Donald Trump and his old school xenophobia. (Seriously, that’s five today before I had to step out, I think.)</p>
<p>I think it’s important to remind this particular audience that things are degenerating both at the macro/political level and the micro/interpersonal one, such that it’s apparently appropriate to use the word “nigger” in front of children, but not listen to a musical about the Founding Fathers because it sounds like black music. </p></blockquote>
<p>Again, these paragraphs only make sense if your presumptive audience is white. I have a really hard time reading them any other way. Do you really think black people are shocked that Trump exists? In the Obama era? With the avalanche of anti-black commentary that&#8217;s pretty much acceptable now and the really creepy ways, at least in the south, for me, that white people have behaved in this era? I mean, sticking with New York alone, even before now, Trump made his bones by not renting to black people and openly calling for the execution of five black kids who were falsely accused of rape and turned out to be innocent. If we think the Republican party is so racist that we uniformly vote for Democrats, why wouldn&#8217;t we think Trump can exist? Why would we even think that Trump is unique? </p>
<p>And he called it degenerating, as though this is somehow new or exceptional and as though there aren&#8217;t dozens of different ways to call us niggers that are in acceptable parlance and used constantly, including the use of the actual word. To argue other than what I said in the quoted text, you&#8217;d have to argue that SEK thought that using nigger in the title had an effect and use for black readers (amended appropriately to me) that contributed something new to conversations about racism. I don&#8217;t think he thinks that. I think he either thought the anecdote would strike and emotionally move white readers, or perhaps he projected his own non-black position/reaction and assumed that whatever he got out of it is something the readers would get out of it. Either way, I&#8217;m a conceptual non-factor here.</p>
<p>If I have to get over seeing the use of the word &#8220;nigger&#8221; every time I post in this thread, dude can get over that sentence.</p>

<p>Or, you know, the intended audience for the argument is white people who were convinced Trump was a joke candidate and really want to deny that this level of bigotry exists in the modern Republican Party. Because there&#8217;s a whole bunch of the those on the center-right/center-left axis of American politics and media.</p>

		<p>In which case, the n-bomb was dropped to shock white people, and a value judgment was made wherein white movement and white conversion is more important than how black people would feel about it, using a slur against them as a starting basis for discussion. </p>
<p>Do you see why this might rub some black people (namely me) the wrong way? You don&#8217;t have to agree, but jesus lord.</p>

		<p>Sure I can. And we can put that into &#8220;agree to disagree&#8221; territory if you want. But it&#8217;s far from obvious, to say the least, that your lack of concern with converting white voters <em>as a means of political reforms</em> is widely held by other black people/activists. It would certainly be helpful if you stopped lecturing everyone else long enough to acknowledge that once in a while.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Again, these paragraphs only make sense if your presumptive audience is white. I have a really hard time reading them any other way.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reasons for that are not particularly flattering to you. Let&#8217;s take a look at this again:</p>
<blockquote><p>liberals and leftists, a.k.a. most of the readers of this site, can’t believe it’s possibly getting as bad as it is, no matter how many articles I write about Donald Trump and his old school xenophobia.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other day Donald Trump suggested closing off the borders to all Muslims, including citizens abroad. That is the most recent example of Trump&#8217;s &#8220;old school xenophobia.&#8221; You have zero evidence that a broad non-white audience could have predicted that remark or are utterly unsurprised that he said it. </p>
<p>In particular, you have <em> zero evidence </em> that American Muslims currently abroad believed two weeks ago that things have become so bad that a leading Presidential candidate would this week be suggesting they should not be able to come home to their own country. I am sure some non-white people, no matter how jaded, are somewhat surprised at such a turn. And yet? You say it&#8217;s a thought that intentionally and deliberately centers whites, anyway, <em>because you do not care.</em> </p>
<p>It is very likely that Muslims and non-white people in general are less surprised by xenophobia. Well, let&#8217;s strike that, it&#8217;s obvious people in those groups are less surprised by xenophobia and racism than whites are. But you are suggesting that they have no capacity for surprise at this particular historical moment, such that &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s gotten so bad, has it really?&#8221; is a purely white thought. A thought that centers politics around white people. You said that, but you&#8217;ve got nothing to back it up I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

		<p>Indeed, isn&#8217;t thoughts similar to &#8220;I can&#8217;t beliece it&#8217;s so bad that a cop can get away with choking a black man to death even when the whole thing got caught on camera?&#8221; a big part of what led to the upswell of momentum for BLM?</p>

		<p>Meta-comment:</p>
<p>This is an interesting example of what may already have a name, but what I think of as the &#8220;ecological argument,&#8221; which is used in normative or quasi-normative contexts, which is basically to say &#8220;You could be right, or just have a good case at being right, but it might not be better for everyone to agree with you if having a mix of different views, or just available spaces where your views aren&#8217;t dominant, is better for everyone.&#8221; </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a really fascinating argument, but it&#8217;s actually pretty weak logically. After all, if you&#8217;re conceding the other person might be right, how much *more* right do they have to be before the value of toleration is swamped by the value of having everyone not be a terrible?</p>
<p>As an example, if I made this argument on a debate about jokes built on offensive racial stereotypes &#8211; &#8220;well, I&#8217;m never going to say it in mixed company, it&#8217;s just for all of us non-race-members to have a giggle!&#8221; someone might justifiably respond that such things rarely stay walled in, they serve to perpetuate racist views that find much more dangerous and harmful ways of expressing themselves than just jokes, and like it or not stereotypes inform how we act in real situations. It&#8217;s clear that in some cases the ecological objection is very persuasive, too, like &#8220;people can have different norms of table manners at football games than at fancy dinner parties.&#8221; But in most of the intermediate cases, the argument is pretty vague and says more about the relative priorities of the arguers than any meaningful normative conclusions. Which is just to say, it has very little logical or normative force.</p>

		<blockquote><p>You could be right, or just have a good case at being right, but it might not be better for everyone to agree with you if having a mix of different views, or just available spaces where your views aren’t dominant, is better for everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nope. Not what I&#8217;m saying. I think I was pretty clear above, and you&#8217;ll note that I didn&#8217;t venture into who &#8220;had a good case at being right&#8221; because I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a meaningful discussion. My point is of course that different norms obtain to different degrees in different spaces, and that there&#8217;s a disagreement here about the norms everyone should observe. You&#8217;re trying to reduce that to, &#8216;you&#8217;re almost certainly right, but I&#8217;d rather be deferential to the people who are wrong so we can have pluralism here, because pluralism is objectively good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, not at all what I&#8217;m arguing.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s really funny is the guy who claims to be indifferent to what others are thinking is the same one lecturing us on the importance of building alliances.</p>

		<blockquote><p>That Drexciya thinks the real problem with this post is SEK and not actual racists shows how totally useless he is in our comment threads.</p></blockquote>
<p>Says the guy who thinks the real problem with the commentary on his posts is the liberal parents and not actual racists.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hilarious how situationally contingent your sense of leftist ethics is, Erik.</p>

		<p>I mean it&#8217;s truly mind-boggling how you can switch in a matter of hours from calling people racist because their actions even inadvertently contribute to structural racism and blathering about how not all racism is the KKK to whinging that an ill-advised post title can&#8217;t be racist (even by that definition) because SEK isn&#8217;t in the KKK.</p>
<p>The only consistent thread in your writing is that Erik Loomis is a SUPERGENIUS whose personal resentments are indisputable facts because he&#8217;s had two books published by famous presses this year.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve largely lurked on comment threads like this since they&#8217;re unproductive as fuck. We&#8217;re well past actually discussing the issue at hand and we&#8217;re knee deep in piling on one of the few black posters this site has (which isn&#8217;t a good look, by the way).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really sure why Drexciya&#8217;s original posts engendered the response they did. Pointing out that running a post with a racial epithet in the title may not be a great idea isn&#8217;t exactly revolutionary. Trying to justify it by saying that it&#8217;s important to not censor such racism doesn&#8217;t really fly here. I don&#8217;t think that anybody who posts here is somehow in the dark about what racism is, or the many ways that it can manifest itself. This audience isn&#8217;t in need of some hard lesson about life. We&#8217;re all adults here, and we&#8217;re intelligent enough to not have every little thing spelled out to us. A high school class? Ok. A college class, even? Sure. This ain&#8217;t that. </p>
<p>Even if you didn&#8217;t agree with his point&#8230;&#8230;.this shit is way over the top given what was actually written. Reading the comments, you&#8217;d think Drex was personally threatening you or something. Erik showing his ass with that post above? Never seen that about any other poster here, and I&#8217;ve lurked for about 3 years now.</p>

		<p><em>Even if you didn’t agree with his point&#8230;this shit is way over the top given what was actually written. </em></p>
<p>My first reply: </p>
<p><em>This is the first I’ve heard of this ongoing discussion — admittedly, I haven’t been around as much as I used to be — but I do normally censor such words (e.g.), but in this case, the inherent contradiction in the statement was the point, so I wanted to keep its rhetorical power intact.</em></p>
<p>My second reply ended like this:</p>
<p><em>I see your point that it can be used indiscriminately, but I don’t use it in that manner. When I want to highlight a particularly powerful piece of racist nonsense that includes it, I’m going to go with the direct quotation, because the whole point isn’t to water it down, but to remind people of awfulness that exists in the increasingly perilous now.</em></p>
<p>Instead of discussing that disagreement, I was treated to a series of pedantic lectures, to which I responded point-by-point, only to have him address none of the issues I raised and repeat his point again, which is that despite the fact that we&#8217;re on opposite sides of a well-established argument within the discipline of African-American studies, I should defer to his side <em>because</em>. You know, <em>because</em>. Which means I&#8217;m a bad person for agreeing with the wrong African-American scholars.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that&#8217;s why this argument annoys me so much &#8212; it&#8217;s pure academia, complete with the petty bullying of folks like Drexciya, and I&#8217;ve had enough of that bullshit for one lifetime. I&#8217;m more than happy to a civil conversation about different theories about the usage of the word &#8220;nigger,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not about to cede to the floor to Drexciya just because he demands it &#8212; that&#8217;d just be intellectually dishonest, and the scholars whose work I&#8217;d have to betray to do so is ridiculously long and august. I&#8217;m not going to toss them overboard just because someone I just encountered tonight wants me to.</p>

		<p>My comment about posts being over the top wasn&#8217;t specifically directed at you (though I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve covered yourself in glory here, either), but meant to be applied generally. </p>
<p>We have very different conceptions of bullying. Him pointing out that the use of the word was offensive to him&#8211;along with the not so subtle suggestion that you should edit the post&#8211;isn&#8217;t bullying to me. Him pointing out his race to further this point isn&#8217;t bullying to me. And let&#8217;s be real: <em>this isn&#8217;t even his damn blog</em>. He doesn&#8217;t have the power to actually threaten or bully anyone here. It isn&#8217;t his space. Hell, you threatened to delete his posts. That&#8217;s closer to bullying than what he&#8217;s posted here (and to be clear, I wouldn&#8217;t classify that as bullying so much as I would call it a dick move).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see this as some attempt by Drexciya to get everyone here to stand in awe of his e-persona here. I see it as him trying to get people to realize that things that they say/do/write can&#8217;t always be taken for granted. I don&#8217;t think you were trying to offend anyone with your post title. I don&#8217;t think Drex thinks that it was intentional, either. <em>But it did.</em> And when that gets pointed out, the responses to that can&#8217;t be defensiveness and (again being general) hand-wringing over tone and personal attacks about how he&#8217;s a useless poster.</p>

<p>BINGO.  I agree with the entire post, but most specifically that the offense was unintentional, and that defensiveness is not exactly stellar ally behaviour.</p>

<p>I think this is the source of the 300+ comments on this.  It&#8217;s absolutely fine for Drex to point out that he found the blog title offensive.  I don&#8217;t think anyone denies him that, or thinks he should just swallow his feelings and keep quiet.  What I found objectionable is the way he went about expressing that, which seemed to me to be accusing SEK of willful insensitivity.  That seemed uncalled-for.  He went way beyond just saying that he found the title offensive.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We’re well past actually discussing the issue at hand and we’re knee deep in piling on one of the few black posters this site has (which isn’t a good look, by the way).&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call a spade a spade here: At the end of the day Drexciya is roughly 80% schtick in comments here anymore, and that schtick is come up with a reason to take offense and then lecture liberals on how they&#8217;re so wrong on everything and you can&#8217;t argue with him because you aren&#8217;t black.</p>

		<p>The famous English phrase comes from Nicolas Udall&#8217;s 16th century translation of Erasmus&#8217; <em>Apophthegmes</em>:</p>
<p><em>Philippus aunswered, that the Macedonians wer feloes of no fyne witte in their termes but altogether grosse, clubbyshe, and rusticall, as they whiche had not the witte to calle a spade by any other name then a spade.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Spade&#8221; here means &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spade" rel="nofollow">shovel</a>&#8220;.  So, you know, no.</p>

		<p>Right, the common phrase refers to the shovel, but it does appear that spade is a 19th century racial slur I was heretofore blissfully unaware of, so I will accept my incredibly embarrassing timing of phrase here.</p>

		<p>So you&#8217;re saying that the currency of that phrase has 0% to do with racism? Just like nobody ever says &#8220;niggardly&#8221; as a racist troll?</p>
<p>Words, like superheroes, are more than just their origin stories.</p>

		<p>This does&#8230;not make any sense at all. One is an extremely common phrase that predates the now apparently antiquated racial slur&#8230;the other is a random word that sounds like &#8220;nigger&#8221; that people use to hardy-har their longing for the days when they could go for the gold in polite company.</p>

		<p>Please don&#8217;t. Do you have anything to suggest that the current use of &#8220;call a spade a spade&#8221; has to do with the separate racial slur?</p>

		<p>Like &#8220;niggardly&#8221; as a racist joke, only the context.</p>

		<p><em>Words, like superheroes, are more than just their origin stories.</em></p>
<p>In actual spoken English, I&#8217;ve never heard anyone use &#8220;spade&#8221; as a derogatory racial epithet.  In actual spoken English, I&#8217;ve heard literally dozens of people use &#8220;spade&#8221; as a synonym for &#8220;shovel&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not denying that &#8220;spade&#8221; can&#8217;t be used in the former fashion (I&#8217;ve read it in Elmore Leonard novels), but I will contest the idea that &#8220;call a spade a spade&#8221; is an inherently racist expression, especially as I&#8217;ve heard it formulated as &#8220;call a spade a shovel&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It was nevertheless poorly chosen for this thread. (FWIW and I think that&#8217;s not much, I&#8217;ve heard spade used in spoken English.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of fancy shovels they had when you were growing up, but in my day they were all spades.</p>

		<p>Ahhhh&#8230;.that is such an obscure one that I literally had forgotten all about it.  I think the only time I ever encountered it was like 20 years ago in a Raymond Chandler novel.  Are Robert and Drexciya seriously arguing that it was an intentional slur?</p>

		<p>Alright, I guess I should make this less succinct.</p>
<p>If people are trying to claim, seriously, that Drexciya doesn&#8217;t use his leftism and self-claimed blackness to assume the mantle of speaking for all black people, and then using that as a cudgel to imply anyone who disagrees with him is a racist while dragging out endless subthreads over minute rhetorical points in an effort to center the comments on him&#8230;then this is so obviously wrong I don&#8217;t even know how to respond to it. </p>
<p>And this is really the problem with Drexciya&#8217;s tone, as it were. He&#8217;s really not that much different than someone like, say, David Sirota, who imagines that he speaks for all progressives all of the time. There is <em>never</em> any acknowledgement or awareness from Drexciya that he doesn&#8217;t speak for all black people, that he doesn&#8217;t even necessarily identify with &#8220;mainstream&#8221; black opinion in many aspects, or that other black people actually write things in public that often expresses a different point of view than his (and when confronted directly with this his default response is insulting dismissal). And then he backs all of this up with the self-assuredness of a 20 year old who thinks he&#8217;s smarter than his professors. So if, say, you don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s adequately considered that repealing the first amendment would probably entail drastically more harm to black protesters than to white people who say racist things in public, you couldn&#8217;t possibly have come up with a potential problem worth considering, you&#8217;re just invested in the white supremacy of the country and you probably have a problem with black people&#8217;s opinions too. Or you&#8217;ll get a glib two word response to an effort at good faith argument which is, rather clearly, textbook trolling. It&#8217;s all an effort to flame threads and make them all about him.</p>
<p>It is what it is, and like Erik I don&#8217;t remotely understand why so many people are invested in insisting this isn&#8217;t what he does in every. single. thread. he&#8217;s in.</p>

		<p>If I weren&#8217;t so ADDI, I&#8217;d do the exact same thing.  Detailed and careful construction of words and ideas are important in a hostile arena, and this is a skill I am very envious of Drexciya about.</p>
<p>Then again, if I weren&#8217;t so ADDI, I&#8217;d probably be in some lab somewheres, not being stupid enough to reply to commentators like you.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ve interacted before, and I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re much more effective than Drexciya. He&#8217;s not so much &#8220;careful&#8221; as he is verbose. As SEK says above, when Drex ends up in a drawn out argument he chronically jumps all over the map, elides or outright ignores very specific points/questions in response, repeats himself as a mode of argument, and ultimately resorts to simply responding with &#8220;Wow&#8221; or &#8220;Ok&#8221; or some other glib dismissal.</p>

		<blockquote><p>There is never any acknowledgement or awareness from Drexciya that he doesn’t speak for all black people, that he doesn’t even necessarily identify with “mainstream” black opinion in many aspects, or that other black people actually write things in public that often expresses a different point of view than his (and when confronted directly with this his default response is insulting dismissal). </p></blockquote>
<p>Shah8 on LJP pretty much agree with him about the post title, which is the main point of contention. I think SEK has a powerful argument but you can&#8217;t really say he&#8217;s won over black commenters, which means it&#8217;s particularly unfair to say without support that Drexciya &#8220;doesn’t even necessarily identify with &#8216;mainstream&#8217; black opinion.&#8221; Like, that means the &#8216;mainstream&#8217; black opinion as such is silent tonight?&gt; I&#8217;m not really sure that&#8217;s true in this thread about this issue, at all. I just think he&#8217;s abrasive and imputes bad ill-intent way, way too easily.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll be more charitable than that: He&#8217;s certainly not devoid of ANY good points, and much of his radicalism makes for interesting discussion. Certainly his personal experiences with being black in America make for a unique perspective here as well. Really if it wasn&#8217;t for his reflexive formulation of &#8220;Drexciya equals all black people therefore disagreement with Drexciya equals racism and dehumanization of black people&#8221; he&#8217;d be a really good commenter.</p>

		<p>Clearly Erik as a self-professed leftist show all of us white people exactly how to find authenticity as an ally of black radical voices, which is to claim not to care at all what anyone else thinks of his writing. Why should Erik bother with something so prosaic as how others, including black people, react to his words?</p>

		<p>All Internet comment sections are about the posters seeking authenticity for their own positions.  Every last one of them.  It&#8217;s kind of the point.</p>
<p>But yes, this particular instance is certainly partly about wanting to defend SEK without coming off as trying to stifle a black radical voice.</p>

		<p>Agreeing with ExpatJK and Lord Jesus Perm.  As a long-time lurker and occasional commenter, I&#8217;m really disappointed in the behaviour by two moderators and many commenters here.</p>
<p>I fundamentally agree with Drexciya, of course.  As one of the few black commenters capable of maintaining an immense amount of patience while being criticized (sometimes quite rudely) by many folks at once, he&#8217;s one of the most valuable commenters you have.</p>
<p>Refusing to value the point of view and lifetime of experiences of a black person commenting on a post about anti-black racism, while also implying (I&#8217;m *sure* this was unintentional, of course) that he&#8217;s not a part of the intended audience of your post, is inherently racist.  Mentioning one&#8217;s ally work as a defense against making a mistake in a post title is &#8216;demanding cookies&#8217; or a pass, an inherently oppressive act.</p>
<p>Claiming that to southerners, being Jewish is viewed as being black is extremely offensive, and racist, as it completely elides the peculiarities of anti-black bigotry in this country v the peculiarities of anti-Jewish bigotry here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also profoundly puzzled why it was necessary to include the entire racial slur when using &#8220;N&#8212;&#8211;&#8221; would have been just as clear.</p>
<p>This is such a disappointing thread.  This community sorely needs more diversity in both it&#8217;s posters and commenters.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not saying more prudence may not have been called for in title writing, but as far as content goes does anyone actually think typing &#8220;N&#8212;-&#8221; actually has the same anti-racist resonance as actually typing out the full word? In my experience it seems like the former is bordering on a sort of eupehmism that falls into the &#8220;everyone knows REAL racism doesn&#8217;t exist anymore&#8221; terrritory.</p>

		<p>Well, I think the use of the full word has costs, and those should be weighed against whatever anti-racist benefits one imagines its use may accrue.</p>

		<p>What cost is there to pointing in very straightforward terms that lots of &#8220;nice&#8221; white people still casually toss around racial slurs in 2015?</p>

		<p>Not all readers of this blog are white, and it is clear that at least some of them would prefer not to have the word shoved in their faces on this site. I mean, this is not an explicit &#8216;whites only&#8217; site, it is not unreasonable to assume that some of the readership may be Black and could feel less than comfortable if there is an anti-Black racial slur in the post title? That&#8217;s a cost. </p>
<p>As Lord Jesus Perm says above, it is not clear what benefits would accrue to this audience, and this thread pretty clearly shows that there are costs.</p>

		<p>To be very clear, I wouldn&#8217;t use the word in a blog title myself, even as a quote, if only for exactly the reasons Farley noted about the dissemination of the headline and such. </p>
<p>Now, beyond that, I&#8217;m not sure what there is to say in response from that. If the argument is supposed to be &#8220;you simply can&#8217;t use this word, even if you&#8217;re a journalist quoting someone for the explicit and obvious purpose of making an anti-racist argument&#8221; then I can respect that as your personal opinion, but then we&#8217;re just in &#8220;agree to disagree&#8221; territory.</p>

		<p>Is this an audience where that resonance really makes a difference, though? Again, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a soul who posts/lurks here that doesn&#8217;t understand what that word means. Is anyone here under the impression that racism is some set, defined thing that only means, &#8220;Personally shooting Medgar Evers&#8221;? I don&#8217;t think that typing &#8220;N&#8212;&#8221; would diminish the meaning of what SEK was trying to say given the space in which he posted it.</p>

		<p>Actually, I do find that cutting through the euphemistic bullshit of &#8220;I&#8217;m not a racist, but&#8230;&#8221; rhetoric does grab the attention of people who don&#8217;t *want* to be racist, per se, but at the same time can be sympathetic to that bullshit when you layer it up behind a lot of &#8220;not racist&#8221; euphemisms.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Refusing to value the point of view and lifetime of experiences of a black person commenting on a post about anti-black racism, while also implying (I’m *sure* this was unintentional, of course) that he’s not a part of the intended audience of your post, is inherently racist. Mentioning one’s ally work as a defense against making a mistake in a post title is ‘demanding cookies’ or a pass, an inherently oppressive act.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what I&#8217;m talking about. It&#8217;s just nuts. SEK mentioned his &#8220;ally work&#8221; in response Drexciya suggesting not merely that he edit the post title, but that he broadly change his &#8220;habits.&#8221; Well, gee, when someone suggests that you adopt new posting habits, you might talk about your current habits. Calling that end of the exchange  &#8220;inherently oppressive&#8221; is pretty vile and not really because it might have bothered SEK. It&#8217;s vile because it defines down oppression so that we can&#8217;t even use the word any longer. And do I want to know if &#8220;demanding cookies&#8221; is actually a phrase with some currency right now? No. No I don&#8217;t. </p>
<p>And AL</p>

<p><em>And do I want to know if “demanding cookies” is actually a phrase with some currency right now? No. No I don’t. </em></p>
<p>Oh dear.  I think perhaps some understanding of the power dynamics and the expectation when &#8220;demanding cookies&#8221; would help you understand it&#8217;s oppressive nature?</p>
<p>I freely admit I&#8217;m not interested in quantifying the extent of oppression inherent in individual acts and only labeling acts with, say, 50 or more oppression points as actual oppression though.</p>

		<p>Again, saying SEK engaged in an oppressive act by &#8220;mentioning his ally work&#8221; is laughable, not least because Drex himself opened the door to SEK&#8217;s pattern of posting.</p>

		<p>I might have missed something, here.  Can you explain why SEK&#8217;s ally work or past postings here are relevant to Drexciya&#8217;s opinion on the use of a racial slur in a post title and SEK&#8217;s response to that?</p>
<p>I may need to read up above again, but that inherently sounds like someone implying they either deserve to use racial slurs in posts where *they* feel it&#8217;s warranted &#8212; due to expertise??, or that they deserve a pass for this potential mistake dues to all prior good deeds.  Hmm, or both.</p>
<p>To the former, no white ally can claim remotely the level of expertise on the topic of anti-black racism that a black person has by way of being black.  Lived experiences trump that.</p>
<p>To the latter, allies mess up all the time.  You&#8217;re not one day &#8216;tadaa!&#8217; an ally, and are one forevermore.  It&#8217;s a continual process, and there will always and forever be mistakes made.  Some hugely important aspects of being an effective ally is listening to folks who have personal, lived experience of discrimination, and being capable of taking their criticisms in, processing them, and acknowledging when harm is committed *whether intentionally or not*.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re bowing out, so I&#8217;m not going to reply substantively, except to say that comments like this: </p>
<blockquote><p>implying they either deserve to use racial slurs in posts where *they* feel it’s warranted — due to expertise??, or that they deserve a pass for this potential mistake dues to all prior good deeds. Hmm, or both.</p></blockquote>
<p>Strikes me as a product of the activist mindset run amok, because SEK wasn&#8217;t saying any of that. He has explained himself at length and his references to his past &#8220;ally work&#8221; grew organically out of the conversation and were not a ploy to shut Drex down or claim a pass; he&#8217;s talking about an actual debate in his field of study where he has an actual ands cogent position. You just apparently lack whatever it takes to even understand or credit his arguments.</p>

		<p>Extremely tepid thought from one of the Suits: Post titles appear out of context in ways in which no other blog content does.  This includes automatic posting to the Facebook page, the RSS feed, the twitter feed, etc. This means that &#8220;nigger&#8221; is appearing sans context, often to audiences who are unfamiliar with the blog, its authors, and its culture, who didn&#8217;t click the blog directly (and consequently didn&#8217;t ask to be part of this particular conversation), and in situations that often aren&#8217;t conducive to a click, and consequent revelation of broader context.</p>

		<p>See, now this is a valid complaint. I thought the quotation marks made it clear that I&#8217;m quoting someone, not making an assertion, but I can understand adding something like &#8220;Shit Racists Say:&#8221; to the headline. (I&#8217;m on my iPad, I can&#8217;t edit the post from here, but I&#8217;d be fine with that.)</p>

		<p>SEK, you were, and are, being ridiculous, and it shouldn&#8217;t take Farley to tell you this.</p>
<p>Racism 101:  White people don&#8217;t get to use nigger, and not expect some level of offense from black people, who have diverse reactions.  You use it at your own risk, <em>including risks to your credibility</em>, and it is incumbent on you to take care that there is some real justification for that use of the epithet.  It&#8217;s not rocket science.  It&#8217;s not counting angels on pins.  It&#8217;s not the PC Police gunning you down in the mean streets of Oxford, MS.  It&#8217;s just the assumption that you will be hospitable to more than just like-minded white people!</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t even Racism 101, this is shit genteel urban <strong>Southerners</strong> of both racist and nonracist inclinations understood well. </p>
<p>The idea that you can be *this mad* at someone who did take (mild) offense doesn&#8217;t speak well of you.  This thread is still going to be fucking here tomorrow, next month, next year, and if people don&#8217;t forget it due to other events, you will mostly likely feel sorry for what you said! Got.Dam.  This is like that Crooked Timber flame war I engaged with Holbo over his liminal anti-gay comparison to anti-race/Sam Ervin post.  Lots of furious offense at being challenged and using every bit of those mighty IQ points to defend the indefensible.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m going to speak up as somebody who thinks Farley and Lemieux are correct, but that Drex isn&#8217;t necessarily right here. A title can appear anywhere, including on, say, your computer screen when your co-worker walks by. If nothing else, using a slur in a post title is in the traditional sense NSFW for both black and nonblack commenters, because your job almost surely does not care about use/mention and may not even care if you are black; they just don&#8217;t want the word emblazoned on company screens.   </p>
<p>But please recall Drex said the whole post was basically worthless to him and that it was a product of a mindset that &#8220;deliberately and intentionally&#8221; centers white people. Even if you agree (even if Farley and Lemieux do as well), those claims are very different from the suggestion that you not use an epithet in a headline or that you modify it in a post body.</p>

<p>Exactly. And Drexciya has repeatedly taken issue with the entire enterprise of making anti-racist arguments intended for white audiences in the past. Which is his prerogative, of course, but then he directly parlays disagreeing with him on a point that is ultimately tactical into a form of racism.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not &#8220;ultimately tactical&#8221;. We either exist or we don&#8217;t. You either talk to us like we do and like you care that we do or you don&#8217;t. And when you make your decisions, we remark on them, if we choose. That&#8217;s how the cookie crumbles.</p>

		<p>Yes Drexciya, disagreeing with someone on the efficacy of rhetorical strategies is the same thing as denying that that person exists. Everyone simply must agree with you as a matter of basic human rights, and you NEVER exaggerate or overdramatize your arguments.</p>
<p>And who, exactly, is &#8220;us?&#8221; Certainly you wouldn&#8217;t be arguing that ALL black people agree with you and NO black people think that persuading reachable white voters is an important aspect of achieving political change, would you?</p>

		<p>Since you&#8217;re not on my do-not-reply-to list, I&#8217;ll comment thus.</p>
<p>Does tone actually matter in this case?  You accept that the post title is inappropriate.  That&#8217;s game.  Does it really matter then, how you feel about Drexciya&#8217;s responses?</p>
<p>If it does, why?</p>

		<p>Drex went well beyond arguing only that the post title should have been censored in this thread.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but if a yes/no on the post&#8217;s title was actually &#8220;game,&#8221; this thread would be about 40 comments long.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the effort to walk it back to &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the headline&#8221; is smart, too. That much of the argument was perfectly reasonable, and I am unsurprised that multiple commenters writing in to defend Drexciya are seeking to cut the tape at the point.</p>

		<p>The post title wasn&#8217;t the only point he made, and I think Drex deliberately baits people into arguments, imputes bad motives, and is frequently dishonest. I try not to reply to him most of the time but commonly get sucked in. </p>
<p>I do think it&#8217;s odd your asking why it matters what I personally feel about his responses. It doesn&#8217;t have to matter to you. Did I ask that? It matters to me, obviously, and I&#8217;m not going to justify to you why my own feelings matter to me, because even in this thread that&#8217;s a little far-fetched.</p>

		<p>Thing is, a big part of the start of this thread, Drexciya is absolutely and unambiguously right and SEK absolutely and unambiguously wrong.  Then the Drexciay 5:43 post happens, and SEK goes nuke in response, and referencing something that apparently happened at Salon?  Then my eyes glazed over and I didn&#8217;t read all of the one-by-ones that happened subsequently, much of which is SEK making personal attacks and tone arguments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m asking why it matters because I do not see a good reason for you to be mad.  You keep saying, for example, that Drexciya baits people.  You don&#8217;t give an example, and if I have to search above, it reads mostly like Drexciya trying to get SEK to walk a bit in Drexciya&#8217;s or any other black person&#8217;s shoes.  Drexciya, essentially, doesn&#8217;t blankly state that SEK was offensive and leaves it at that (tho&#8217; the very first response was of that nature, but vaguely), but explicitly describes the power relations and situational complexity of the post title, and then explicitly describes how a black person might feel about it, without filters for the benefit of white people&#8217;s good opinion of themselves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really fucking hard for me to see passive aggressiveness here.  That requires forcing people to make guesses about what Drexciya was saying!  And Drexciya was vague only in the very beginning!  As a drive by comment!  And what in the world was the bait?  The fact that Drexciya challenged, in detail, how SEK was wrong?  Shit, was there one friggin&#8217; post where, if the goodly posters left it alone, the villainous Drexciya&#8217;s insinuations would inspire doubt and dislike of SEK&#8217;s character?</p>
<p>Or was it SEK&#8217;s unhinged response that did damage to SEK that would not be there if he didn&#8217;t engage the evil troll, Drexciya?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to make a circuitous tone argument in the face of Drexciya&#8217;s general correctness, I think you have some obligation to show *harm*.  Hence the question.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;re not going to agree on this, and it&#8217;s all there in detail already, and you&#8217;ve admitted that you didn&#8217;t read the exchange between him and SEK terribly closely. There&#8217;s a level of Fibbonacci spiral absurdity in what you&#8217;re claiming I&#8217;m obligated to do, especially given the arguments I&#8217;ve made elsewhere in this thread.    </p>
<p>I obviously don&#8217;t need to show *harm* to say I <em>feel</em> that Drex baits people into avoidable arguments and imputes bad faith intent onto them. The suggestion that I need to do so &#8212; or what? &#8212; is risible, because you can take or leave my opinion. You don&#8217;t need to show harm to disagree with me or SEK. Enough people here clearly agree with me that Drex is an abrasive guy who relishes conflict. Show &#8220;harm?&#8221; You&#8217;re kidding. </p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll say that Drex made a lot of shoot-from-the-hip statements about<em> intent</em> that are not clearly and unambiguously correct (in fact, I feel they&#8217;re just the opposite, and quite destructive), that he reduced SEK&#8217;s argument at times to &#8220;I have black friends!&#8221; and that he began the whole thing in a nasty and disingenuous way and argued that the entire post was worthless and excluded all nonwhite people from consideration, all without foundation. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, though; since you felt it was necessary to start your response to me by telling me I&#8217;m on your do-not-reply list even as you replied to me several times, it&#8217;s kind of humorous for you to ask me to explain what about Drex is so irritating to me. Because the short answer is: stuff like that.</p>

		<blockquote><p>My answer is simple, give me something. Date stamps. Anything.</p>

<p>Couple things:</p>
<p>Giving me an analysis I didn&#8217;t ask for in the first place and then demanding a sufficiently detailed reply, complete with citations, isn&#8217;t asking for reciprocity.   </p>
<p>I did reply to you upthread, but I wanted to check out once you started asking me why my own feelings should matter to me. I don&#8217;t think you get it, but that&#8217;s actually rude. And in a way I&#8217;m reluctant to provide you an annotated version of a separate conversation between two other people on this thread simply because I respect you enough to believe that if you were going to agree with me, you would already have done so. I am not so persuasive &#8212; or so interesting &#8212; that a few more magic words will get you to disavow what I view as Drexcyia&#8217;s incindiary and confrontational personal style. Suffice to say that  I think Drex began in a passive-aggressive and disingenuous mode in his very first post and that his 4:25 posting was vintage stuff: the accusation of deliberately and intentionally centering white people&#8217;s emotions, the suggestion that SEK develop a new habit of posting and, later on, the comment that the entire post was worthless to him &#8212; Jesus, don&#8217;t you get that&#8217;s rude? &#8212; and,  as I&#8217;ve said multiple times and which you&#8217;ve ignored, later on he started the &#8220;black friend&#8221; business, which was nasty and unnecessary.  He also kept calling him &#8220;white&#8221; after he said he was Jewish and didn&#8217;t identify as white. He only corrected himself after being reminded.</p>
<p>By asking for this type of explanation, you&#8217;re basically implying SEK was crazy to get frustrated and did so only out of privilege, and that if the explication of the offense isn&#8217;t sufficiently robust, the offense is unmerited and the feelings are invalid because there is no &#8220;harm.&#8221; Do you REALIZE why that&#8217;s bad, or no? Are you trying to adopt a really insulting mode of argument stereotypically associated with pushy white people to be instructive, or what?</p>

		<p>I concur with Rob. I don&#8217;t have any objection to the quote in the body of the article (although personally I would use asterisks or something), but I would not use the n-word in a title barring some extraordinary circumstances, and I would suggest this as policy going forward.</p>

		<p>Given the racial climate in this country (see Trump&#8217;s rhetoric), I&#8217;m not finding SEK&#8217;s encounter with that bigot particularly shocking.  Would have been a better story if SEK had spewed a witty retort to the old bigot though.<br />
I&#8217;ve noticed a pattern of liberals encountering racists and passively reacting to racist sentiments. I assume this emboldens racists to believe that all Whites share their abhorrent opinions.</p>

		<p><em>I’m more than happy to {have} a civil conversation about different theories about the usage of the word “nigger,” but I’m not about to cede to the floor to Drexciya just because he demands it — that’d just be intellectually dishonest, and the scholars whose work I’d have to betray to do so is ridiculously long and august.</em></p>

		<p>What a depressing spectacle.  The way it looks to me, Drexciya had just two things to say: A) As an African American, it really sucks seeing that word in the post title, and B) It would be good if posts (especially posts about racism) were written with a Black audience in mind.  (Okay, and then some stuff about hip-hop music that I didn&#8217;t really understand, and that seems tangential.)  It was, in fact, one of the mildest interventions I&#8217;ve seen him make; one might even describe its tone as mostly courteous.  Is that why it got this over-the-top reaction?</p>
<p>There is a multitude of suck on display, but for me the lowlights include one masthead writer declaring bravely that he wouldn&#8217;t be bullied (by an anonymous commenter with absolutely zero power to bully anyone) because changing the title would be a betrayal of African American scholars (and then changing it anyway when two white peers requested it), and another opining that the only reason anyone pays attention to what Drexciya has to say is because he&#8217;s Black and they&#8217;re guilty white liberals.  I hope they at least realize what assholes they look like.</p>
<p>I disliked Drexciya enormously when he started commenting here, mostly because he&#8217;s clearly a know-it-all grad student and is thus my natural enemy.  But he&#8217;s grown a lot on me over the last few months, not least because of the animus he&#8217;s quite patiently faced.  I don&#8217;t always agree with him, by any means, but he&#8217;s well worth reading and I&#8217;ve learned things from him.  And I think it has to be said that his critique of (white) liberalism is validated by the dominant reception he&#8217;s had here.  I hope that despite this reception, he decides to stick around.</p>

		<p>I tend to agree. I don&#8217;t like his politics but I admire the fact that he takes a contrary stance here consistently and coherently. I think that stance is mostly wrong, but he&#8217;s certainly throwing the cat among the pigeons and would be a loss IMO. The hypocrisy is also something. I mean if drexs rhetoric was on gender or directed at an out group it would probably be applauded. It&#8217;s the beast of political correctness gone mad coming back to consume it&#8217;s parents</p>
<p>Edit: and his point about the op is absolutely valid. It&#8217;s voyeurism,  identifying an old white southern racist to a blog of race aware liberals is hardly startling or breaking new ground</p>

		<p>Just for the record, first, I had Farley change the post title last night not because of Drexciya&#8217;s arguments &#8212; which I still disagree with &#8212; but because he and Other Scott made valid points.</p>
<p>Second, I kindly invite Drexciya never to post on anything I write again. I&#8217;m not banning him from the site, so he&#8217;s free to post on anything anyone else writes, but he&#8217;ll need to self-police, as I don&#8217;t have time for his pathetic grad school theatrics.* If he does post on anything I write going forward, I&#8217;ll delete it.</p>
<p>*And I&#8217;ll note that it&#8217;s not the content of his disagreement that got him banned from commenting on my posts, it&#8217;s the manner in which he did so. I don&#8217;t want the comments on every post I write to become about Drexciya, which is exactly what single-issue trolls like him desire.</p>

		<p><em>I don’t want the comments on every post I write to become about Drexciya, which is exactly what single-issue trolls like him desire.</em></p>
<p>If next time you&#8217;re capable of responding to mild criticism with less defensiveness, this won&#8217;t be an issue.  This was entirely in your court, SEK.  You&#8217;re the damned blog writer, not Drexciya, you have much more power here, and you ought to recognize the added responsibility for your behaviour and your response to criticisms that goes with that.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t Salon.  You don&#8217;t just write a piece and walk away.  This is a blog community, and your choice to respond or not to commenters, and HOW you respond defines what sort of blog community this is, as much if not more so than how commenters comment on your posts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s deeply shocking and upsetting you&#8217;re banning a black man from commenting on your posts on anti-black racism due to BOTH your and his bad behaviour.</p>
<p>Good grief, this blog is a mess.  Were I Drexciya, who is already capable of much, much more patience than I am, this would be the point I&#8217;d see this blog is openly hostile to black voices when those black voices are, at times, critical of white liberals, and I&#8217;d leave.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m letting the record speak for itself here &#8212; I offered <a href="http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2015/12/turn-your-nigger-music-down-there-are-kids-here/comment-page-1#comment-1783899" rel="nofollow">numerous</a> <a href="http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2015/12/turn-your-nigger-music-down-there-are-kids-here/comment-page-1#comment-1783945" rel="nofollow">responses</a> that were <a href="http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2015/12/turn-your-nigger-music-down-there-are-kids-here/comment-page-1#comment-1783949" rel="nofollow">completely cordial</a>, to which he responded with hostility, unfounded inuendo, utter ignorance, and irrelevant off-topic insults as to my intentions and character. That&#8217;s not a conversation, it&#8217;s an animate diatribe, and given that this is my blog, I&#8217;m within my rights to say that I don&#8217;t want every single comment thread on something I post to be about Drexciya. <em>Which this one still is</em>. Troll wins! </p>
<p>If the troll hadn&#8217;t argued like a troll, hounded me like a troll, dominated the conversation like a troll, I wouldn&#8217;t ban him from my threads for acting like a troll. I&#8217;m perfectly happy to be criticized for my failings, I have many of them &#8212; but I&#8217;m not going to engage with someone as intellectually dishonest as Drexciya proved himself to be in this thread. There just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day.</p>

		<p><em>I offered numerous responses that were completely cordial&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I just went back a reread those.  For a strict definition of &#8216;cordial&#8217;, those were perfectly polite posts.  They also seemed to be missing what I thought to be Drexciya&#8217;s point.  You resorted to defensive explanations of how you think using a racial slur is appropriate, when frankly, it would have served this entire thread much better if you simply acknowledged you inadvertently caused harm to a black reader, apologized, and changed the darn title because why the heck is it important to you to use a racial slur?</p>
<p>Being cordial, while frankly being (inadvertently) dismissive of Drexciya by not listening and by being defensive is just not good enough behaviour for a white person commenting on anti-black racism or responding to criticisms of such by black people.</p>
<p>These are such basic missteps its astounding I&#8217;m seeing it here.   </p>
<p><em>&#8230;but I’m not going to engage with someone as intellectually dishonest as Drexciya proved himself to be in this thread.</em></p>
<p>Then don&#8217;t engage!  Banning him is something entirely different than refusing to engage further with him.</p>

<p>I did the first, acknowledged our difference of opinion on the matter, but I wasn&#8217;t about to let someone I didn&#8217;t know browbeat me into changing what was, his unfounded claims to the contrary, a considered decision to include the slur in the title. </p>
<p><em>Then don’t engage! Banning him is something entirely different than refusing to engage further with him.</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;s not banned from commenting on the site, just on my posts, because I don&#8217;t believe he has anything of value to offer them. Once a troll reaches the level of having his rote talking points predicted and spelled out by other commenters, there&#8217;s no more conversation happening, it&#8217;s just tired repetition. And I&#8217;m tired enough as is.</p>
<p>Of course, Drexciya can prove whether or not he&#8217;s a troll by whether he responds to my request or is incapable of self-policing and continues to post anyway.</p>

<p>First, acknowledging a difference of opinion is not the same as acknowledging another person&#8217;s opinion or engaging with what it might be telling you.  It&#8217;s just an old politician&#8217;s device.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to agree to disagree.  Now, move along.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Second&#8230; browbeat?  I&#8217;d like you to consider how your frame for dialogue makes you less willing to take in feedback and thus miss an opportunity.  </p>
<p>Third: I don&#8217;t think he ever said anything about you not making a considered decision about the title.  What he seemed to say was there may have been considerations you overlooked.  He told you what those consideration might have been.  You proceeded to tell him, in response, that such considerations were invalid.  </p>
<p>Now, in a sterile debate environment, where everyone has similar experiences, that might be fine.  But when one person is speaking from the real world of experienced racism, you might want to consider how telling him that his considerations are invalid may be a subtler form of &#8220;turn down that black music.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, just so we&#8217;re clear: you don&#8217;t know what browbeating SEK is referring to; and also, if he doesn&#8217;t agree with Drexciya, you&#8217;re calling him a racist like the guy in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>

		<p>No, I didn&#8217;t say that, although it would easier to dismiss what I said if I did, indeed, say that.  </p>
<p>I essentially said that if you make a post about something terrible and racist that happened (fair enough) and a black person shares their experience with you about how maybe your own post might have a troubling racial aspect within it or maybe even revealed another (or deeper) truth about racism in America, and you don&#8217;t at least acknowledge that person&#8217;s concerns rather than shoot them down and call them a troll, then&#8230; you know, don&#8217;t expect to get any awards.</p>

		<p>Didn&#8217;t say what? Which part didn&#8217;t you say?</p>
<p>That you don&#8217;t know what browbeating SEK is referring to? <em>Second… browbeat? I’d like you to consider how your frame for dialogue makes you less willing to take in feedback and thus miss an opportunity.</em></p>
<p>Or that you didn&#8217;t just equate SEK disagreeing with Drexciya to the guy in the parking lot?</p>
<p><em>you might want to consider how telling him that his considerations are invalid may be a subtler form of “turn down that black music.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p>you know, don’t expect to get any awards.</p></blockquote>
<p>ORLY? Is that what telling someone their actions are a milder version of the guy in the parking lot did? Saying you don&#8217;t want to give them an award?</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t wiling to stand behind an accusation of racism using forthright words, then you know that your charge is so weak that you disown and downplay it the first time you&#8217;re called on it, maybe you shouldn&#8217;t be slinging around the charge in the first place.</p>

		<p>Oh damn, I had an eerily similar post typed up and then decided against it.  Thank you so much.  You said all of that much better than what I&#8217;d typed out.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize this: <em>First, acknowledging a difference of opinion is not the same as acknowledging another person’s opinion or engaging with what it might be telling you.</em></p>
<p>The difference between the two is quite clear to me in this thread.</p>

		<p><em>What he seemed to say was there may have been considerations you overlooked</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s manifestly not what he said:</p>
<p><em>if I’ve observed your motives and target audience for this post accurately “so what” is best filled in by “so I decided to use an anti-black ethnic slur in a post title that will be reproduced, specifically to comment to white people and with limited consideration for how and whether black people will be offended by it and with no responsibility to mute or cushion that effect”</em></p>
<p>I grant your point, though &#8212; if you remove the trollish aspects of Drexciya&#8217;s posts from them, they seem far less trollish. I never said his considerations were invalid. My response was, and I quote:</p>
<p><em>I considered it — such considerations are my day job, after all, it’d be strange for me to suddenly not consider them here — and this whole comment thread is evidence of me taking responsibility for your having been offended. Hell, despite the fact that I’m inclined to believe you’re arguing in bad faith, this comment thread is probably instructive to a number of the people reading it, and I’m fine with that. It’s the suggestion that I’m causally throwing out profanities for reasons other than condemnation that’s the problem. You want to impute ill-intent, despite the fact that you’ve repeatedly proven you know absolutely nothing about me — which just from an argumentative perspective is a piss-poor strategy.</em></p>
<p>Just because my considerations didn&#8217;t accord in the end with his reason for questioning them doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m invalidating his. It just means that I took his objections about the use of the word in the title into consideration <em>before I posted this dialogue</em>, and came to a different conclusion about the rhetorical efficacy of doing so. I can acknowledge his considerations without acceding to them, after all. (To think otherwise is lunacy.) </p>
<p>This really isn&#8217;t that complicated. We&#8217;re discussing one single-issue troll who routinely takes over threads, not a blanket effort to silence an entire group of people.</p>

		<p>I think you really missed a good opportunity here to do some valuable self reflection here.  Fortunately for you, that opportunity won&#8217;t end today.  I&#8217;ll add my two cents, in case it matters.  My (white male) observation is that what annoys &#8211; and threatens &#8211; you about Drexciya&#8217;s comments is not that they were about him, but that they were about you.  You wanted the story to be about a jaw-dropping Old White Man, a figure of derision that we can all get on board being aghast at.  We all feel aghast together, we all feel good together.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, per se, but I imagine that it&#8217;s not a very advanced political observation in the perception of people who have witnessed the Old White Man scenario roughly every day for all their lives.  So, instead of joining with and congratulating you on your aghast experience, Drexciya&#8217;s comments were to turn the lens onto you, first by questioning whether the post title was a valuable rhetorical choice to meet an anti-racist end and, second, to question your perception of your post as valuable at all in forwarding an anti-racist awareness (beyond the obvious).  As I read it, he was asking you to be self-reflective and maybe change your thinking so that your posting might go deeper.  And, as I read the following responses, it seemed like you weren&#8217;t prepared for that and got really defensive.  As a White man, I feel like I&#8217;ve been in that state of mind many times (and so I can concede that I may be projecting here).  Unfortunately, that defensiveness turned first to buffing up your bona fides rather than considering &#8220;how might this post look to someone who isn&#8217;t me&#8221; and then, when that wasn&#8217;t sufficient, it devolved (by you and others) into simply derogating the character and intent of your commenter.  </p>
<p>In the end, your invitation to Drexciya not to ever comment again on your posts is disturbing.  You would probably argue that it&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s arguing in good faith and that he wasted your time.  But I think it&#8217;s likely more true that he is, ultimately, questioning YOUR good faith and whether YOU are wasting HIS time, and you tried to convince him to believe in your good faith, and you failed in that end, and that hurt, and you said, well, then, go away.  </p>
<p>Which, really, is like a total microcosm of not-overtly-racist White America&#8217;s reaction to Black America&#8217;s request that maybe White America could do better than being just-not-overtly-racist and White America getting all exasperated, shutting down, and eventually voting for a Republican because, hey, Those People are getting out of control.</p>

		<p><em>As I read it, he was asking you to be self-reflective and maybe change your thinking so that your posting might go deeper.</em></p>
<p>Look, that&#8217;s what <em>you&#8217;re</em> doing, that&#8217;s not what he did. And notice that I&#8217;m not threatening you with a ban. I&#8217;m more than happy to do that, no matter who it is that encourages me to do so. But when trolls start trolling, I have no patience for it. </p>
<p><em>You would probably argue that it’s because you don’t believe he’s arguing in good faith and that he wasted your time.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m arguing. There&#8217;s abundant evidence above of his doing so. People are mistaking activism for Desperately Wanting To Win An Online Argument, and I&#8217;ve judged Drexciya of embracing the latter in order to seem like he&#8217;s a warrior for the former. But after looking at his interactions in this post, and going back and looking at numerous other comments threads that became entirely about him, I made my decision. </p>
<p><em>Which, really, is like a total microcosm of not-overtly-racist White America’s reaction to Black America’s request that maybe White America could do better than being just-not-overtly-racist and White America getting all exasperated, shutting down, and eventually voting for a Republican because, hey, Those People are getting out of control.</em></p>
<p>The day you see me vote Republican, I&#8217;ll accept the legitimacy of this analogy.</p>

		<p>Be annoyed with Drexciya, disagree with Drexciya, blah, blah, blah, but acting like he&#8217;s some out of bounds troll is whiny bullshit. And banning him from commenting on your posts, by your testimony from one interaction, is just wrong.</p>

		<p><em>And banning him from commenting on your posts, by your testimony from one interaction, is just wrong.</em></p>
<p>I did a little digging last night and found that almost <em>all</em> the posts &#8212; we&#8217;re talking about 90 percent or thereabouts &#8212; on which Drexciya comments end up becoming about Drexciya. That&#8217;s the very definition of a troll, and that&#8217;s not someone I want to interact with.</p>

		<p><em>That’s the very definition of a troll&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I think Drexciya has at times been out of bounds.  But this also isn&#8217;t the first thread derailed by Drexciya&#8217;s comments where the derail says a hell of a lot more about the posters and commenters here and the paternalism of their anti-racism and liberalism, and the way in which those values waver in the face of (sometimes mild!) criticism by the very groups one supposedly supports.</p>

		<p>No, but I think black people commenting about racism should get a fair and lengthy hearing, just like any expert should before non-experts decide he or she is wrong.</p>

		<blockquote><p>So disagreeing with Drexciya means one is paternalistic and values-challenged?</p></blockquote>
<p>On the contrary.  Lots of commenters have disagreed with him, and have often (in my opinion) won their argument.  But pretty much the entirety of SEK&#8217;s response in this thread has been paternalistic and dismissive, and this is true of many other people on this site who have interacted with Drexciya.</p>
<p>As others have noted, SEK didn&#8217;t actually engage with the points Drexciya was making.  His response moved rapidly from &#8216;I just disagree with you&#8217; to &#8216;How dare you question my anti-racist bonafides,&#8217; and on through &#8216;I&#8217;m widely read on racial matters, so I don&#8217;t have to listen to you&#8217;; &#8216;You&#8217;re just a troll&#8217;; &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re even Black&#8217;; &#8216;This is my blog, so shut up&#8217;; and &#8216;Stop bullying me!&#8217;&#8211;and concluded with &#8216;You may only comment on my blog posts if you say things that I approve of.&#8217;  Calling this merely &#8220;paternalistic&#8221; is being generous.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not so sure it&#8217;s really a derail.  A key aspect of the OP seems to be to highlight White people&#8217;s capacity to have blind-spots on racism that can become readily apparent when viewed from another perspective.  Much of this thread (the tone policing, defensiveness, trivializing microaggression etc.) illustrates that point rather well.  Also I don&#8217;t know how focussing on/criticizing the first and most prominent words that any of us will encounter in reading the post can be seen as tangential or derailing. </p>
<p>I also think calling Drexciya a troll or claiming he routinely derails threads and/or &#8220;makes them about him&#8221; are both extremely unfair claims.  Drex clearly cares deeply about racism in both the most overt forms and in the more subtle forms that the mostly-White commentariat here can easily miss.  Most of his insights happen in threads that are about racism.  Some highlight racial angles that the OP or discussion hasn&#8217;t touched upon.  Some challenge the very premise and centered-ness of the discussion itself.  Neither of those are troll behavior imo, and both are very much needed in mostly-White spaces.  He passionately defends his views, explains them at great length and receives tons of pushback.  The volume of back-and-forths may eventually make the thread appear to be &#8220;about him&#8221; but I&#8217;ve never seen him do anything to make <em>himself</em> (rather than the issue/angle he&#8217;s presenting) into the center of discussion.  Not in the way that Jennie or some of the other resident trolls do in an attention-seeking as opposed to discussion-having way.  As someone else noted, Drex has his interests and speaks about them when they come up.  That makes him pretty much like everyone else here.  That his hobby horse comes up more than others&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t be a big surprise given what&#8217;s going on nowadays and given how often the front-pagers write about racism.  That he sometimes makes people uncomfortable is a good opportunity to question why it does so and what role that the White Supremacist culture all around us, plays in setting us up for such discomfort.  And while obviously nobody speaks for #AllBlackPeople, the points and criticisms Drex raises here are far-from-radical and are fairly commonplace in the Black spaces where I&#8217;ve lurked and listened.</p>
<p>Apologies if I&#8217;ve used this analogy before but&#8230;if Farley posted about some dude who called women &#8220;c*nts&#8221; or gay people &#8220;f*gs&#8221; or Jews &#8220;k*kes&#8221; etc., putting the words in the title of the OP, and someone from those marginalized groups cried foul over it publicly, would that person be the recipient of so many self-centered/troll/derail accusations?   Would that tone policing of that person be justified?</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t the definition of a troll someone who comments for the express purpose of causing disruption, not dialogue?  And, any other of his posts aside, didn&#8217;t Drexciya&#8217;s comments start first with &#8220;ugh&#8221; (a reaction) and then with questions?  Here is what he wrote:</p>
<p><em>Rhetorical power to what effect? With what audience in mind?</p>
<p>And I’m not casting aspersions, but there are about two million other ways to frame that exchange — even leaving the excerpt completely, faithfully intact (“nigger” and all) — that isn’t just bam wow in your face n-bomb every time I look at the post and see a response to it. Who’s that supposed to shock exactly and how? Why is the presence of shock, effect or worse a value worth cultivating in this context?</em></p>
<p>Notice that there&#8217;s a complexity of information there: questions, opinions, personal experience, and further questions.  All seems very dialogue-like, if also obviously with a frustrated tone.</p>

		<p>Which was immediately followed by him telling me what I should write about:</p>
<p><em>You would challenge far more about this place if you made more of a habit of talking about, engaging with and linking non-Hamilton hip hop/rap. I mean, I can’t promise I’d want to read it, but it would at least be addressing a noticeable absence here.</em></p>
<p>And then calling me a racist for not writing about it:</p>
<p><em>What is the n-bomb deprived standard for racist treatment of rap? “Rap is crap?” “I don’t like most hip hop except for Eminem?” “Rap isn’t real music?” “Rap was only good in the 80’s/90’s?” I mean, one of the natural consequences of segregation is occasionally expressed through segregation in tastes and cultural exposure. Is maintaining the results of that something worth addressing in spaces that note the ideal of diversity/inclusion and multiculturalism? Are there consequences to falling short of that?</p>
<p>Also, to what extent is minimal engagement with rap (or heck, even recent R&#038;B, (neo)soul, gospel or slightly older, sadly faded genres like New Jack Swing — much of it from living, still producing artists) also a minimal engagement with black culture generally? Is making such a culture effectively alien not a primary contribution to “othering” — which I’m sure we all agree has a negative impact?</em></p>
<p>And when it was brought up that I just haven&#8217;t written about that <em>here</em> or <em>recently</em>, he changed the subject back to this post, and this post only, that&#8217;s all he was talking about. He wasn&#8217;t telling me what to write in the future, and he was unwilling to address what I&#8217;ve written either elsewhere or in the past because it wasn&#8217;t relevant to his new argument, such as it was.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how trolls behave.</p>

		<p>I think his point, all along, has been that LGM has a dearth of black voices, isn&#8217;t responsive enough to black people&#8217;s concerns, isn&#8217;t versed in black culture the way he thinks it should be and is too self-congratulatory about how racist white conservatives are. So what you write elsewhere isn&#8217;t really germane to that subject. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a troll, he sticks to the same set of, I assume, sincerely-held concerns and complaints. Say what you want about them, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s making them to get a rise. </p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t see how he&#8217;s calling you a racist.</p>

		<p>Yes, thank you, person I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m new to the ways of the Internet, and haven&#8217;t encountered trolls like him before. Your invaluable advice is much appreciated.</p>

		<blockquote><p>And then calling me a racist for not writing about it:</p></blockquote>
<p>How on earth is the quotation that follows calling you a racist?  He&#8217;s suggesting that such dismissals of hip hop are different from what the old racist guy says only in degree, not in kind.  (I wouldn&#8217;t agree, but then the last hip hop album I bought was probably &#8220;Three Feet High and Rising&#8221; so I&#8217;m not really in a position to judge.)  You&#8217;re not his target: he doesn&#8217;t say here or anywhere else that you dismiss hip hop in this manner.</p>
<p>What he does say directly to you is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven’t called you a racist, I made as forthright of an effort as I can muster to address your arguments (as I interpreted them, with all due personal limitations) and you can take or leave what I said, as you will. I don’t think my preferences are rendered invalid by them being personal, but there’s only so much you can do in marginalized political contexts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which seems like a pretty mild complaint.</p>

		<p>I went back and reviewed the initial Drex and SEK exchange and I can kind of see why it goes off the rails.</p>
<p>I believe the original Drex post about the title being wrong is legitimate. It&#8217;s just too click-baitish for my taste and completely lacks context. Even if insisting on keeping n**** intact in the title, something like &#8220;Old white dude told me to turn to turn the n****  music down&#8221; is much better as a title.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the issue that the shock value of the title is doing it at the &#8220;expense&#8221; of a potential Black reader&#8217;s personal visceral reaction which is different than a White reader&#8217;s visceral reaction b/c it isn&#8217;t <strong>personally</strong> felt.</p>
<p>Where it goes off the rails though is when SEK responds to Drex&#8217;s initial reasonable comment with &#8220;it needs to be there for the shock value&#8221; which then degenerates into Drex going well beyond the title issue and basically saying &#8220;you&#8217;re just a clueless White dude, stuff like this is banal, you&#8217;re writing this for White people, this whole post is worthless, write better stuff&#8221; more or less which understandbly SEK took to be a &#8220;trollish&#8221; personal attack.</p>
<p>I do think that Drex&#8217;s second point also has some merit but its completely unsurprising that personal attacks will be taken &#8220;personally&#8221;. It&#8217;s not easy to separate the personal attacks from the substantial point. And it can definitely come off as trollish even if that wasn&#8217;t the intent.</p>
