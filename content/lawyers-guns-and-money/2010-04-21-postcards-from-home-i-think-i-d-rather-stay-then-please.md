I pause to ask the pressing question: do any among you have any clue what this woman is talking about?  _Does she_?  My answer, as you might figure, is a vehement: "No, with thunder."  She is [making me uncomfortable with her words and what she says](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) not because of their content, as they're free of that burden, but because of their form; or, more accurately, their formlessness. Nine hundred poor Canadians purchased $200 tickets to listen to the segue-free ramblings of a woman who forgets the subject of her sentence by the time she reaches the verb, then the verb by the time she reaches the object _but keeps talking anyway_.  Such is, after all, the beauty of talking points: so long as you say them all, the coherence of the speech containing them is inconsequential.  "Sound bites" are called "bites" instead of "meals" for a reason now.
