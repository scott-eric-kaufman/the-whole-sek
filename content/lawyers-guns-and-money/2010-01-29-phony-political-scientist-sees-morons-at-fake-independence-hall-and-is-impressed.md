Update.  
If you're going to [pretend to be an academic](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/scott-eric-kaufman-if-you-smear-my.html), Donald Douglas, you shouldn't link to [something](http://acephalous.typepad.com/about.html) that says I'm a "Doctor of Philosophy of English," then write that I claim to have "a Ph.D. in the â€˜Philosophy of English.'"  People who work in academia should, after all, know what the letters "[Ph.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor\_of\_Philosophy)" stand for.  Moreover, survival in academia requires the actual refutation of points.  It's cute that you noticed I made two typographical errors, but neither error was material to my argument (the substance of which you've yet to refute).
