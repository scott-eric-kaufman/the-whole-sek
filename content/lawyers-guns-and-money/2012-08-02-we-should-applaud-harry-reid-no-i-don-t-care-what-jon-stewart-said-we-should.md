## We should applaud Harry Reid. No, I don’t care what Jon Stewart said, we should.

I like the fact that someone who’s nominally a liberal has finally recognized what conservatives have been doing to Obama for four years now, and I appreciate the fact that he’s choosing to do so about a financial disclosure instead of, for example, whether someone’s really an American or whether they’re [a sleeper agent for the Muslim Brotherhood](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2012/07/find-them-make-them-say-the-words). It’s not Harry Reid’s fault that conservatives have tacitly authorized this particular model of public document-shaming, he’s simply taking advantage of the fact that they have.
