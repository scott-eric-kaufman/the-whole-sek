## Mormon prophecy, much?

I don't want to extend Romney the benefit of any doubt, but it's possible that he's not quoting Popeye there. It's possible that he's quoting Exodus 3:14 — in which God tells Moses that his name is _[Ehyeh asher ehyeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_Am\_that\_I\_Am) —_ which means that Romney's merely asserting that his Presidency will fulfill [the White Horse Prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_Horse\_Prophecy). Or something. I'd just rather believe a presidential candidate is invoking double-secret messianic nonsense than quoting a cartoon character whose popularity peaked in 1955. Unless this is his idea of courting the youth vote. In which case, given what I know student knowledge about culture prior to 2004, I strongly encourage him to continue this line of incredibly relevant and moving references that the young voters of today implicitly understand.
