Iâ€™ll have a substantial sequel to [my 
Mad Men 
post](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/01/don-draper-as-unraptured-emma-bovary.html) up later today or tomorrow, but for the moment, you can read two solid replies from [Amanda Marcotte at 
Pandagon
](http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/how\_scientific\_is\_marketing/) and my friend [Joseph Kugelmass at] (http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/i\_dont\_care\_what\_the\_critics\_say\_i\_love\_mad\_men\_and\_the\_sopranos\_and\_the\_hi/)
[The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/i\_dont\_care\_what\_the\_critics\_say\_i\_love\_mad\_men\_and\_the\_sopranos\_and\_the\_hi/).
  For the most part, I agree with what Amanda wrote and think [Joe is as wrong as wrong can be](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/i\_dont\_care\_what\_the\_critics\_say\_i\_love\_mad\_men\_and\_the\_sopranos\_and\_the\_hi/#27239) when the discussion involves the topic of your dissertation (as this one does his).
