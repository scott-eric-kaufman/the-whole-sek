## "How" and "Why" trump "When"

Conservatives are extremely amused by the fact that [Markos Moulitsas _et al._](http://perfunction.typepad.com/perfunction/2010/10/historic-illiteracy-idiot-sarah-palin-party-like-its-1773-after-the-election.html) apparently didn't know that the Boston Tea Party took place in 1773 _but Sarah Palin did_.  Not mentioned so often is that she knew it [because it was written down on a sheet of paper in front of her](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-tea-party-express-20101019,0,2450180.story).  Like Sarah Palin, I can appear very knowledgeable about almost anything when I'm reading a speech written by someone who actually knows something.  The larger irony here, though, is that a group of people who have no idea _why_ the Boston Tea Party happened are crowing because a few liberal bloggers aren't exactly sure _when_ it did.  Such is the legacy of No Child Left Behind: they memorize the dates, but have little or no idea why they're actually memorable.
