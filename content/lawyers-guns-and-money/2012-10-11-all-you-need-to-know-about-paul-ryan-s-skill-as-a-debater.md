The one thing you don’t address — the one you know better than to pursue — the one that must be avoided at all costs — the one that must not even be mentioned in a debate with Joe Biden is _a tragic car accident_. The attempt to elicit sympathy for Romney by anecdotal proxy is a poor enough of a play. The decision to do so via an anecdote about a tragic car accident _in a debate with Joe Biden_ means you’re either a sociopath or possessed of an idiocy of immeasurable power.
