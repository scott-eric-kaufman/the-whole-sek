So what does he do? _He stares at himself in the vanity mirror and sees a dupe with the truth in his hands and his pants around his ankles_. The episode's final irony is that for all the revelations and  connections that were drawn and communicated through staring, everything  that just came back together is going to fall apart because Hank just  happened to glance at something. Hank got lucky, or Walter became  sloppy, but what this final moment demonstrates is that whereas Walter  needs to stare because he needs to be certain 100 percent of the time to  maintain his secret, Hank only has to half-notice one thing and  half-remember another in order to expose it.
