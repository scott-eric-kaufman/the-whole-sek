## <em>Mad Men</em>: “It’s not your tooth that’s rotten,” it’s “The Phantom.”

There’s clearly more to be discussed vis-a-vis holes and memories in  this episode—Pete’s paramour, Beth, will be using electroshock therapy  to create a Pete-shaped hole in her memory—but for now all I’ll say  about that situation is that it seems at odds with an episode that deals  with repression in such a psychoanalytic fashion. Lane’s suicides  heralds the return of the repressed, which takes the forms an Adam and  an abscess, and Don deals with both of them in a manner that speaks to  increased psychological health. Beth, however, removes the need for any  sort of reintegration by obliterating the organ that records and  reshapes memories. She is, by the episode’s end, less of herself than  she was at its opening. I’m not sure what to make of that, but I’ll put  it out there and see whether you can’t do something with it.
