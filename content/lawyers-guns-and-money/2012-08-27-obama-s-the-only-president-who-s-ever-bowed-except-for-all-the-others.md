For reasons that will become abundantly clear, that emphasis is mine. Zinke's logic is that he shouldn't fight to protect American freedom if the President is going to go bowing around the world willy-nilly. Moreover, he feels entitled to take this stand because other former military men, including the man who was once the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower, remained "active in speaking out and shaping the policy of our country[.]" Implicit in Zinke's claim is that someone like President Eisenhower would never diminish the office of the Presidency by bowing to foreign leaders. One problem: conservatives already floated this notion that [the](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/11/14/obamateurism-of-the-day-156/) [President](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/11/024948.php) [never](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15516) [ever](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/bowing-before-monarchs-and-tyrants.html) [bows](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/11/obamas\_botched\_bow.html) so I already know a little something about President Eisenhower: _the man could not stop bowing_. Hi there, Pope John XXIII!
