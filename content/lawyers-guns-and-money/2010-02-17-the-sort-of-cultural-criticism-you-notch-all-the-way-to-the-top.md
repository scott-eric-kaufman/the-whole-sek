Of course!  Jena was priming the Pump of Irony.  Had he not dropped in a completely random, utterly irrelevant reference in that first sentence, readers may have breezed over his criticism of Brosnan without realizing how ironic it is when someone with Jena’s linguistic facility criticizes someone else for mouthing an infelicitous metaphor. We’re not sure whether we should thank him or file this away with all the other examples of cultural conservatives whose knowledge of the culture they aim to conserve is as wide and deep as a playa lake.
