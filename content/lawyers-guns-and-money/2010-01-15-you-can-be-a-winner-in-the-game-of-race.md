So, for Palin, acknowledging a sad political reality is the equivalent of wishing that the Civil Rights Movement had never happened because, for Palin, _racism is a game_.  Not only is it a game, she unwittingly confesses that she and her fellow Republicans are currently very much playing it by themselves, and are annoyed that the Democrats refuse to play along by “kind of letting Harry Reid’s comments slide.”  She wants to play Race because _just this once_, she believes her team can win.  Is it any wonder the large majority of non-white Americans find her and her party reprehensible?
