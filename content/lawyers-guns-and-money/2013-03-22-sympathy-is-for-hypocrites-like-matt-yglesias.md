And if you believe that, [as many conservatives do](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2013/03/well-if-it-affects-me-thats-different), you've sacrificed the very concept of principled belief to the satisfaction of playing "gotcha" politics. Which is all well and good so long as you don't want people to believe you're capable of understanding — much less possessing — principled beliefs.
