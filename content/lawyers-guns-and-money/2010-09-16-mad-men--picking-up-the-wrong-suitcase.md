\*I actually did do some research into optics to see if there were  some hardwired reason that the brain would interpret looking from  right-to-left as "down" and left-to-right as "up" but came up empty.   That's a lie.  I discovered some stuff by Pinker about the relation of  language to visual perception in which he discussed the "natural" eye  movements of English readers as being left-to-right, meaning that  movements from right-to-left seem wrong, which wrongness might be  interpreted by the brain as "down" because humans are hardwired to fear  falling ... but as he was presenting this theory solely to dismiss it, I  thought it best not to press the issue.
