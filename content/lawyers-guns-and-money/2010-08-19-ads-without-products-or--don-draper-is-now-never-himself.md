Whereas she has a private face to complement her public one, Draper is about to enter his apartment wearing his public face because now he has no other.  There is no "private" behind his "public" face.  "Don Draper" has finally fulfilled his destiny: he is an ad for a product that no longer exists.  (I wonder what [someone](http://adswithoutproducts.com/) might think of this.)
