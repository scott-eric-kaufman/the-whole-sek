Of course you don't.  You think that because Goldstein uses variations of the word "fuck," it's reasonable for someone to assume that the paragraph in the original post was written by him.  By that logic, Goldstein also wrote what you said about Farley above—which would mean that you, sir, are a plagiarist.
