And this is the key to the episode: the deaths and violence that  happen off-screen are beginning to intrude into the lives of these  characters. Such things have happened before on _Mad Men_, but  they seem to be coming at an accelerated pace. Why? Because the game is  changing, as are the players, but the game’s not merely evolving from  one into another, as it seemed previously; now the rules of the game are  being changed such that it’s the bottom of the third inning, the batter  asks the umpire if he can take two free throws instead trying to hit  that wicked curve again _and is being given the go-ahead_.
