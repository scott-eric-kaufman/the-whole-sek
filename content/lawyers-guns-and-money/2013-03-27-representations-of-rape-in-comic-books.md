When [I was hit by that car](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/why\_i\_didnt\_pos.html) and pain plus medication turned my  mind to cottage cheese, the most "intellectual" material I could  stomach were comics. Re-reading this one, I stumbled into a  realization: my feminist sympathies were first marshaled while reading  a comic back in the Autumn of '88. The medium is far from perfect, but it's not wholly without value.Â  I'm not defending  myself here so much as describing a stage in my development. So please  don't read this and think "Scott think spandex is _progressive_?" I don't. Only once upon a time, it inadvertently was.
