That's correct. The [most prominent neurologist in America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas\_Weir\_Mitchell) opposed educating women because they would become smarter, pass on  their larger brains to their children, then die during childbirth.  Outside of giraffes, it's difficult to find a more classic formulation  of Lamarckian thought. I could go on for ages—or pages, [hundreds of them](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/dissertationabstract.gif)—but  I think I've established that "the Social Darwinism movement" is an  ahistorical construct designed to justify policies and theories with  which I otherwise agree.
