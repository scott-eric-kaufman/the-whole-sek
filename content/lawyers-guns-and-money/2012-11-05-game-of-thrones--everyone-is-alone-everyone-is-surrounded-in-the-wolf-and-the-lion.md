This  shot is nearly identical in scale and composition to the first one I  discussed, only this time the lonely Lannister isn't in jeopardy. He  stands in the center of the circle _threatening_ the periphery as  opposed to being threatened by it. The suggestion from the earlier  shot—that this is secretly a concentric circle—still holds simply  because of the percentage of the frame occupied by Littlefinger's  bordello, but all those spears seem to be pointing at it too. All of  which is only to say that this shot interests me because it undermines  my argument, _i.e._ because it surprises me. In an episode  dominated by lonely and imperiled wolves and lions, this shot suggests  that even though this series is teaching its audience how to watch it,  viewers need to keep vigilant because the writers and directors are more  than willing to confound the very expectations they created.
