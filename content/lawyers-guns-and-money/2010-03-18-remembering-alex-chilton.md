I'd link to some of his catalog, but I'm still  having problems listening to Big Star [because  of the accident](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/nonfictional-lies.html), and anyway, every other blog you read is linking  to one of the four Big Star videos on Youtube. Which, when you think  about it, is fairly incredible: when I was in high school, I was one of  five people I knew who were into Big Star. There must be some powerful  process of self-selection at work here, is all I can say.
