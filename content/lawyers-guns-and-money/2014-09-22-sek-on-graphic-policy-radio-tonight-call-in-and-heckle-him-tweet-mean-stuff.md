I'll be on Graphic Policy Radio again tonight [discussing Fox's new Batman-related show _Gotham_](http://graphicpolicy.com/2014/09/20/graphic-policy-radio-talks-gotham-with-guest-scott-kaufman/). The show begins at 10 p.m. EST and you're more than welcome to call in, tweet at me, or drop me a line on Facebook if you have something you'd like to add to the program — or if you'd just like heckle or berate me. The choice is yours!
