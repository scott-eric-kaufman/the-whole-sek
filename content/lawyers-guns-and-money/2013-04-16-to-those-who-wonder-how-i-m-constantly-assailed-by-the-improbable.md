[Terrible emails were sent](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html). [Cookies arrived](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/behold-the-inte.html). [I tried to file](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/i-tried-to-file.html). [I wanted to kill myself](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/baseball.html).

[Followed by a kidney stone](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/06/i-feel-a-bit-more-manly-now.html).  That brings us to 2010 and doesn’t include any events that could topple  local governments. It doesn’t include my sordid current stalkers or  Porch Wars or any of the other random things that never happen to anyone  that regularly happen to me.
