Wishing someone was not who they are so they can't know what they know doesn't make for a sound epistemological foundation.  It doesn't even make any sense.  In all seriousness, she actually is claiming that people who agree with a person are better able to speculate about that person's beliefs than people who merely knew him or her.  That, obviously, is nonsense: I'm on the opposite end of the political spectrum from my father, but if you wanted to know what he would think about a given topic, you'd be much off asking me than Pamela Geller.
