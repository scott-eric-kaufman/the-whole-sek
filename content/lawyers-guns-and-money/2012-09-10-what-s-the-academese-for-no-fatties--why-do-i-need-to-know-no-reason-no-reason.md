In short: the jobs promised to the Lost Generation are being outsourced to younger and prettier scholars for no particularly compelling reason, except that the younger and prettier scholars are younger and prettier. As Chad Black noted in the linked post, it's not that there hasn't always been a bias against those who don't land a tenure track job after three years, it's just depressing to see it codified in an advertisementâ€”especially in light of what our "betters" have been telling about what will happen when the market turns around.
