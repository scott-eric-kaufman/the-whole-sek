Because even if ISIS isn't lying — which it is, but whatever — you're doing moral calculus in crayon on the walls outside your racist parents' bedroom, and it's unbecoming of a civilized adult society. If the price of humanitarianism is that a few rotten apples spoil a barrel, it doesn't matter because American democracy is a fucking cargo ship and the other 100,000 barrels matter too.
