But what I can’t understand is how a self-professed conservative can look at a “class system” in which the wealth is so mightily sequestered that the images of District 12 could come straight from the pages of _The Pornography of the IWW_ and declare the system depicted to be socialist. That’s one hank of unbraided hair that’ll never be untangled.
