So … recommendations? Including on the drive itself, places to stay that are cat-friendly, etc. Basically any recommendation you have that doesn’t amount to “[DON’T BE DEAF YOU ANNOYING LITTLE COCKSUCKER](http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/2013/07/the-saga-of-sek-hertz/comment-page-1#comment-612520).” (Which, when you think about it, is probably [The Donalde’s way of saying he’s going to miss me](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/) when I’m gone. Not enough to stop sexually harassing his students, but enough to feel a pang _above_ his waistline when he does so, you know, in the part of his brain where shame ought to live.)
