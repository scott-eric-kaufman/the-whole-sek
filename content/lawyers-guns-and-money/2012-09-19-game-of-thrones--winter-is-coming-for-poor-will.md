Which is my point: Van Patten creates a very sympathetic portrayal  of Will in order to use that sympathy to distinguish the perspectives of  the characters in Winterfell by virtue of how they react to him. He  can't replicate the structure of the book, but as I'll discuss tomorrow,  he can create situations in which the content of those individual  chapters is efficiently communicated.
