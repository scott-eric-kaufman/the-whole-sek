**UPDATE:** The Donalde’s forced me to update this post [by writing](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/tbogg-of-firedoglake-liar-well-it.html) that I’m “bloviating with a bunch of nonsense about how some of his former students graduated from law school,” which is a reference to my having written, as is block-quoted above, that “I taught [and this is my overexerted emphasis]  **_journalism_**, and some of my former students are very, very intrepid.”  I’m trying to figure out absurd ways in which his “comprehension” skills can embarrass the profession even more, but I can’t top him.
