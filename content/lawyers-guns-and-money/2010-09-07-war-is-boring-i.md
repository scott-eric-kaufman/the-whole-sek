\*If I seem excessively focused on the personal or confessional aspects of the narrative, it’s likely because I’m working on [my lesson plans](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/07/fall-comics-courses-american-manga-and-coming-of-age.html) at the moment, and _War Is Boring_ slots in nicely with the theme of “Confessional Comics.” Reading it in conjunction with Craig Thompson’s [_Blankets_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891830430/diesekoschmar-20), the content of which could hardly be more different, makes plain one of Axe’s strengths as a novelist: his willingness to depict his self-important or oblivious behavior, as in the “Detroit” chapter, bolsters his credibility throughout.
