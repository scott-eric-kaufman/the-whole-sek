It seems as if Lepore herself might have [a problem with plagiarism](https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov/status/234023201972310016), which if true means it’s possible that Zakaria second-order plagiarized _the work of a graduate student at Harvard_. And we let this man talk to president and kings? To coin a phrase: Why oh why can’t we have a better press corps?
