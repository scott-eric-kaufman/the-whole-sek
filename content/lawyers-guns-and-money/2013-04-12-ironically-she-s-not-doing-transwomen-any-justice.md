And that only provides more ammunition to [people who think](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/04/10/Batgirl-Comic-Character-Comes-Out-as-Transgender) “cis-gendered” is just “another one of those terms invented in universities aimed at  eliminating the word “normal” when discussing sexual preferences.” Because people who think DC is pushing an LGBT agenda will feel like its being “shoved down their throat” when revelations like this are inserted into narratives so awkwardly.
