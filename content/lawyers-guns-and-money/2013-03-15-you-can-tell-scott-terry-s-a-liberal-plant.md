Or maybe not. Maybe he's [this](http://faithandheritage.com/?author=28) "Southern gentleman and blogger," also named Scott Terry and also from North Carolina, who is "working toward a degree in Philosophy and English, likes long walks on  short beaches, fishing and breaking liberal talking-points into tiny  pieces (then spreading nasty rumors about those pieces!)." [Because they seem to have quite a bit in common](http://faithandheritage.com/2011/06/a-young-mans-reading-list/). Both, for example, are very concerned about "standing up for our [_sic_] heritage as Christian white men." Even if that's a different Scott Terry, I will say this about the self-professed "Southern gentleman": it's about damn dime someone created "a conceptual ladder" that prevents Christians from "betraying [their] God and Father" on "[a]ll of [their] positions, from abortion to alien abduction."
