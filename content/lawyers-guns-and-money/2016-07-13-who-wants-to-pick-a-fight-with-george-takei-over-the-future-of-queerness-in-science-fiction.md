Apparently, [the answer is “I do!”](http://www.salon.com/2016/07/12/sulu\_star\_trek\_and\_queer\_sci\_fi\_lgbt\_diversity\_has\_been\_there\_all\_along\_now\_its\_gone\_mainstream/) — with a very welcome assist from the inestimable Adam Roberts, who I compliment in the hope that one day he’ll stop [killing me in his novels](http://amzn.to/2a7nuhy). (He’s already informed me I die again in his next.)
