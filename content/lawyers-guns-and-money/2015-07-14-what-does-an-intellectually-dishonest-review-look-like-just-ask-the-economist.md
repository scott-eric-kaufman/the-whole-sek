The Economist’s review of Ta-Nehisi Coates’ _[Between the World and Me](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812993543/diesekoschmar-20)_ was predictably atrocious, but having just read the book this morning — and [remembering the publication’s record on reviewing books about race](http://www.economist.com/news/books/21615864-how-slaves-built-american-capitalism-blood-cotton) — I thought it best [to subject the atrocious thing to the kind of punishment all of its ilk deserve](http://www.salon.com/2015/07/14/the\_economist\_ta\_nehisi\_coates\_between\_the\_world\_and\_me\_is\_just\_good\_enough\_to\_get\_away\_with\_justifying\_its\_existence/). Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it.
