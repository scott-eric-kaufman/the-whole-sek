Wait—Palin decide to ignore [this asshole](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/how-to-be-an-as.html)?   Excellent.  Anyone with any sense would distance herself from people [like him](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/listen-closely-to-outrage-manufactured-over-an-utterly-innocuous-nea-conference-call-and-you-can-almost-hear-pat-buchanan-re.html), _wait_—did I just suggest that Sarah Palin is a person with sense?  Maybe she _is_ playing 11th dimensional chess.
