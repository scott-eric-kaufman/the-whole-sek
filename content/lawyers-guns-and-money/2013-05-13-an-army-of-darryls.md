In other words: the IRS "[singled out for additional reviews](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/347950/mistakes-were-made)"  groups with "tea" or "patriot" or "912"Â  in their corporate documents  because you don't have a damn thought in your head that someone else  didn't put there. Your creative failure isn't the IRS's fault.
