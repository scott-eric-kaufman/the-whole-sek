I can't wait until [the new site goes live](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/03/ground-shifting.html) and I can tuck bulky material below the fold.  In the meantime, if you're interested in the rhetorical chicanery of early Alan Moore (particularly in [
Miracleman
](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0913035629/diesekoschmar-20)), you can find [an analysis of it here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/seeing-rhetoric-alan-moore-miracleman.html).
