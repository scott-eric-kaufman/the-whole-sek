After  using close-ups to revitalize our sympathy for Ned throughout the final  scene, the director cuts to black right after shoving his face into  ours. Imagine sitting there on your couch at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night,  and the last thing you see before the room goes dark is _that_. _That_ is the image you'll live with for the next week: Littlefinger's  betrayal on his lips and knife beneath Ned's chin. That's no accident.  That's structure.
