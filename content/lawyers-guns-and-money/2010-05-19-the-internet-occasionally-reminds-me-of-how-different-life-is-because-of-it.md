This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance,  merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted  daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory.  The  fact that at some point in the future I can know who I  rode in an elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because [I chose to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/contemporary\_fi.html).  That I can  access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely.
