What better image for “enforced intimacy” can there be than a static [long shot](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039)—by definition a “relatively    stable shot that can accommodate movement without [reframing](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48018)“—of  a psychoanalyst and analysand sitting stiffly in an office seemingly  designed for play?  That Betty is unaware that she will be tricked into  undergoing analysis too only makes the dynamic even more operative.  Her  resistance to this intimacy is figured by the fact that she, unlike  Draper and Miller or her and Draper, is denied a close-up when she tells  the therapist precisely what Draper told Miller: [] (http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01348690221f970c-popup)

The  irony of the entire sequence of shots that begins with Miller and  Draper and ends in a therapist’s office is that although Miller and  Draper are the ones who complain about the need to speak compulsively,  only Betsy is able to successfully resist doing so.  They claim she  needs to “talk about everything,” but the camera contradicts them at  every point.
