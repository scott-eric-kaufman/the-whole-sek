For reasons that should be clear if you read between the lines of the post's last sentence, I'm providing [a link to my analysis of the season premiere of _Mad Men_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/04/mad-men-dont-go-into-the-doorway-don.html) instead of posting it in its entirety here. This situation should be rectified soon enough, but in the meantime, this is how we must roll.
