I'm not saying that Judd hasn't made outlandish statements in the past, but this strikes me as Crowder doing what [John Nolte and Jeff Goldstein](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/john-noltes-outraged-on-behalf-of-topless-women-everywhere.html) and every other anti-political correctness crusader loves to do: telling jokes that white men are forbidden to tell by the dark and womanly multicultural establishment. Because it's just as bleeding edge now [as it was in '77](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7S5BP-tvR8).
