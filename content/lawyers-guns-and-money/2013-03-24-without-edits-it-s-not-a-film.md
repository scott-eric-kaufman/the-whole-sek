This may be one of those simple matters that only confuse me because I’ve studied aesthetic theory — only the learned can be so easily confounded — but I’m having a difficult time understanding what Spector means here. Because he seems to be saying that the best producers are really just building [Rube Goldberg machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube\_Goldberg\_machine) and recording the results, but that can’t be right, can it?
