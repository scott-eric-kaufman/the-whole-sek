\*Which is why I think the final season of _Buffy_ was underrated. Critics became annoyed when Whedon let Buffy rehash Saint Crispin's Day every episode, but that was the point: divorced from her ability to back them up, her words lost their argumentative power; but instead of finding ways to make them more meaningful, she just started to produce more of them, as if she believed that if she talked long enough she'd convince herself, and that once she convinced herself, she'd convince her troops. She failed, spectacularly, to do anything of the sort. It made for stretches of uninspiring dialogue, but that doesn't mean it made for bad television.
